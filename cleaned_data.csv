0,"Are there more books planned for the Licanius series?I only discovered the trilogy this past fall and it quickly became one of my all-time fantasy series of all time. I just love every single solitary aspect of it. It features by far one of the most immersive fantasy worlds I've ever come across, alongside Westeros, Randland, the First Law world and the Six Duchies. 

Does anyone know if James Islington is planning a sequel trilogy or independent spinoff books set in the Licanius universe? Hopefully The Light of All That Falls wasn't the end.",1
1,"Grimdark coming of age booksI have read many books and i have found that I tend to prefer books that have a darker story along with coming of age elements. But im finding it hard to find any books like [this.It](https://this.It) would also be a huge plus if the book only had one pov (Easier to connect to the story.) It would also be great if the mc was perhaps a little evil or turns evil as the series goes on. Some books I have found like this are

Broken Empire series

A picture of dorian grey (not really grimdark but character is good and turns evil)

There is honestly probely more but its hard to remember maybe Bloodsong but idk if that is considered grimdark. Please leave some recs for me it would be greatly appreciated!",1
2,"Fantasy tropes from another POVReading Expanse I realised that &gt;!Adolphus Muntry sounds familiar- he is basically a ""cowboy cop""- but this time opposing our heroes!&lt;

Book version of Witcher has Leo Bonhart &gt;!Typical RPG Bounty Hunter from bystanders POV. Fake Cirilla also counts as ""Princess from commoner!&lt;

Do you recognise some Characters or situations from books or Movies as typical--but presented from another POV?",1
3,"How long does it take to get into the Wandering Inn?Hi everyone, 
I recently started reading the wandering inn, which is like the most famous litRPG (at least that I know of) but I'm not really enjoying it that much. I've read about 10% of the dirst volume and I just don't feel like the story has a plot, it is just the main character walking around. Does it get better or is it just not for me?",1
4,"What's some dark/gothic fantasy that is *not* grimdark?I read Bram Stoker's Dracula a couple of years ago and absolutely loved the brooding, heavy atmosphere, the dread,  otherworldly terror of the night,  etc.   

But I also loved that, despite all of these things, despite losing Lucy in one of the most horrific ways poissible, Mina Harker and Abraham Van Helsing never give in to cynicism or hatred.   Despite the awefulness of the ordeal he's suffered,  Jonathan Harker remains fundamentally himself. 

Basically, I love the atmosphere of dark/gothic  fantasy and it's aesthetic and set pieces and drama and horror,  but I detest the empty,  vile cynicism and nihilism of a lot of popular recent dark fantasy.   

What's some new dark fantasy that avoids these modern failings, that feels more like Stoker or Byron or Dunsany in world-view?  

IE: Dark fantasy that rejects or ignores the ""everything sucks forever and will never get better"" attitude?",1
5,"Books with a similar grim feeling to dark souls?I just started reading the Lies of Locke Lamora tonight and instantly got some dark souls vibes( although it's most definitely pre souls anything). So Im curious to know if anyone can give any recommendations as to fantasy with either a dark souls or bloodborne influence. I love the grimey nature of dark souls, everything just feels so bleak and hopeless but in such a dense detailed way. Not just your average crumbled village, but one that's been totally corrupted by the destruction leaving it with an evil presence and character. Not to mention just the environmental descriptions but the characters always give off that feeling, just a sense that they're not to be trusted. I don't know if any of that makes sense but that's the best description of what I'm looking for. So thank you in advanced and I'm looking forward to any and all recommendations",1
6,"What fantasy series have big magic, and impressive action scenes?I seem to enjoy my fantasy the most when it has ""big"" magic, cool action, and bad ass characters. Perhaps its abit shallow, but I read some pretty amazing series that have those things as well as plenty of depth. Looking for additional recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I read so far (and highly recommend to anyone with similar taste) (Minor spoilers ahead):

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Anything by Brandon Sanderson** \- Because even if it might not always be around its around often enough and when it is its great. Some nights Radiant can fight an army to a standstill, while awakeners can make whole armies out of materials and corpses. Highest power levels get pretty silly.

**Cradle/Travelers gate/Arcane ascension/Mage Errant** series - Turns out I love ""main character powers up"" books. They still have to be written well but this is one of those series. This is bazically ""zero to hero: the instruction manual"". Magic is eeeeeeverywhere. Literally, people without magic are the rare exception (or get very little focus) and even 10 hear olds can break boulders with bare hands.

**Night angel** trilogy - with the focus of the story being on a magical assassin who spends most of his time interacting with magical stuff, there's plenty of magic to go around. And when fights happen, boy is there alot of magic thrown around.

**Lightbringer** \- every single important character has magic. Magic is colorful (literally), does big things, and the stronger magic users can solo a small army.

**Demon wars** cycle - starts off as low magic because no one knows how to use it. Ends with main characters throwing lightning, flying and regenerating mortal wounds.

**Chaos queen** series - While magic is ""rare"", one of the main characters is a drug addict magic savant, the other is a magic assassin with amnesia. Then there's a vampire that turned when she was a 13 year old girl and still looks that way, a priestess that is praying for miracles that come true. The strongest of characters can again solo small armies (and do).

**Licanius Trilogy**\- Starts off pretty ""average"" and proceeds to show you 4000+ year old immortals that shrug off stupid amounts of damage, can practically stop time, make portals, and torch cities.

&amp;#x200B;

So what else can I read that is epic fantasy, has high power levels and big explosions (but executes those things well)?",1
7,"Looking for single pov hero/coming of age fantasy books like KKC or BloodsongI get tired of books with too many POV characters, I usually come to enjoy one of one specific one and all the rest become boring. I just want another hero to fall in love with and watch grow over a series like Kvothe or Vaelin, I also love the aspect of coming of age (character growing over the series).

Some of the books I have read that I believe fit under this catagory are ;

Farseer Trilogy - The book focuses on an orphan bastard who has telepathic powers growing up as on the fringe of royalty. He also gets trained to be the kings assassin, lots of growing pains in various areas of his life.

Cradle Series - Tells the story of a young boy at the lowest rung of society slowly climb his way up by gaining more and more power. (Probly a bad synopsis but yeah)

Mageborn or Embers of Illeniel - Both are great coming of age series (Embers of Illenial gets dark... like super dark)

Left Hand Of God - Great story about a young man leaving his 'Cult' and gaining a new understanding of life (lots of plot twists)

Others are:

 \-The saxon stories

\-Quilifer

\-Stupid Fast by Geoff Herbach

\-Empire of silence

\-Viridian gate (illusionist)

\-Wheel of time (first book only)

\-Riftwar saga (first book liked the ideo of having to be a slave)

\-Dungeon born

\-Tears of heart

\-Shamins crossing

\-Bio of a space tirant

\-Embers of eileniel

\-The Rage of Dragons

\-Enders Game

\-Old mans war

\-Cold iron

\-Sufficiently Advanced Magic

\-Broken empire

\-Belgeraid

\- Novice by Taran Matharu

\- Battlemage by Peter Flannery

\-Brock E. Deskins sorcerer series

\- Nightangel trilogy

\-Mother of learning

\-Dawn of wonder

Also alot of Wuxia books have these features

9,"Reddit Fantasy Writer of the Day - Tao Wong - Author of A Thousand Li, the System Apocalypse and more series - AMAHi there r/fantasy!

I’m Tao Wong, your Reddit Fantasy Writer of the Day. I'm best known (which isn't saying much :) ) as the author of [A Thousand Li](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VXJFRFV) (a xianxia fantasy series) and the [System Apocalypse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077LNLSZ7) (A post-apocalyptic LitRPG); though I have 2 other series as well. I've produced ebooks, paperbacks and audiobooks for all of them and the System Apocalypse even has a comic!

As an author, I've been full-time since 2019 and indie publishing since mid-2017. I actually am fascinated by the business side of publishing and was reading Kristyn Kathryn Rusch's business blog long before I even thought of publishing my own work.

Outside of that, I live in Whitehorse, the Yukon Territories, Canada. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were one of the coldest recorded locations on Earth, coming out of -40C and lower weather (that's -40F and lower temperature for Americans). I've been up here for 7 years now, and spend most of the winter hiding from the bitter cold. I used to own a game store (Starlit Citadel) and managed the business from the Yukon remotely, thanks to some great staff.

Personally, I enjoy the outdoors and do a bunch of hiking and camping. I recently started learning how to snowboard. However, my biggest form of exercise used to be martial arts (I stopped for a few years due to some injuries. I'm hoping to finish fixing them this year and get back to practice). I've been practicing martial arts on/off for two decades now, with time spent doing Western Martial Arts, tai chi, karate, wushu, boxing, etc. Yeah - I never got good at any one thing before shifting to a new style.

Other than physical activities, hmmm... long time RPGer (rather obviously); though not much of a computer game since the early 2000's. Partly because I played a TON of board games or RPGs, and partly due to tendinitis. I love cooking and  I'm a huge TV / movie fan too, though I tend to flip between consuming a ton and then not as I catch up on my reading.

And that's all I can think of to start. Feel free to ask me anything. I don't promise sensible answers, but I'm not super sensible anyway. :)

10,"Books with worldbuilding based on Folklore.I am reading Dresden Files and i really enjoy that ""folklore-ish"" worldbuilding and I would love to read something like that but set in the usual fantasy/medieval setting. Does something like this exist?",1
11,"Fae Hunter by Sarah K. L. Wilson: read it in two sittings.&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqsav3j8ffd41.jpg?width=353&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=750ffa9d85eb678b7b513d094573226f9d09818a

It's been awhile since I read a book in two sittings, but I read the first half of Sarah K. L. Wison's Fae Hunter on the flight down from ConFusion, and the second half the following night. It's a rare book these days that grabs my attention and holds it, but Fae Hunter was compulsively readable.

When her sister opens a portal to the land of the fae and unleashes chaos and horror upon their community, Allie decides that she'll set matters to rights, even if she has to go against the fae, their monsters, and even her own community to do so.

The heroine Allie Hunter is ornery and sensitive, stubborn and desperate, caring and passionate in equal measure. It's her voice that makes this book such a pleasure to read, and when she goes blind at the end of the first chapter to all but the spirit world (not a spoiler, this is in the blurb) the whole book takes a delightful turn toward the strange and unexpected.

Something else I appreciated about this book: Sarah Wilson nails the fae. In my mind true fae should be as beautiful and dangerous as a polished blade, as prone to cut as they are to serve, and Sarah nails this dichotomy, bringing to life fairies who are as inhuman as they are alluring.

It's a quick read at only 224 pages long, and despite being quite dark at times is billed as a YA fantasy. If you're up for a fun, fast paced novel with an engaging setting, an easy to root for heroine, plenty of danger lurking in the eves, wonderfully nasty villagers who are even more to hate than the fae, and all of it told in a compulsively readable manner, then take a look at Fae Hunter. You just might devour it in two sittings as well.

12,"Recommendations for books with adventuring party’sI’ve always had a big love of ensemble casts in fiction. I imagine I’m not the only one who thought that when the whole Fellowship was together, that was some of the best material in LOTR. There’s something really comfy and fun about the traditional adventuring party to me. I love seeing all these varied character dynamics from people of all different backgrounds and skillsets learning to empathize and work together towards a common goal. Even outside of fantasy I think ensembles are fascinating, like the crews from Star Trek, or superhero teams like X-Men, Justice League, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.

Now I’ve been getting back into some old reading habits lately and been in a huge fantasy mood in particular thanks to recently starting Fire Emblem Three Houses. I’m especially a big fan of high/epic fantasy, but I like a little bit of everything. A lot of my favorite fantasy works, literary or not, feature a prominent adventuring party at the center, like something you’d see in a D&amp;D party for example. So I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations for books that featured such ensemble casts?

There’s already a number of stories like this I’m familiar with. Like Fellowship of course, and the original Dragonlance books. I’m slowly making my way through Wheel of Time too. I’ve got many other series on my radar at the moment as well, like Stormlight Archive (along with Sandersons other works), and the Malazan series (not sure if it’s an ensemble but looks interesting regardless).

I would especially love to hear recommendations for books/series that have interesting lore and magic systems (original requests, I’m sure) and for anything by female writers or with really prominent female characters. I’d especially love to hear about any all female ensembles, from what I’ve been able to research those are pretty rare in traditional fantasy stories.",1
13,"A little disappointed by The Rage of Dragons after all the hype on this subPicked up Rage of Dragons recently after seeing some overwhelming praise on here about it, and since the author is a Redditor and started indie, I thought I'd go ahead and support him. the book seemed right up my alley too - cool, underutilized setting, something a bit older than your typical medieval times, and one of my favourite tropes: the magic/military academy. 

After finishing the book though, I must say I'm a little underwhelmed. There are some things I liked a lot about it. As I mentioned, the African setting is not very common (although maybe moreso lately) and it's nice to see some diversity on that front. The worldbuilding with the tribes was pretty interesting and well-developed. 

The book was paced quite well, too. For the most part, it moved pretty fast, and I have to say I don't ever think I was bored. There's something always happening.

What I didn't like about it are the aspects I typically value above all else when reading: characters, dialogue and prose. This is where the book lost me a bit. For the most part, the characters felt a little flat and undeveloped. Tau in particular wasn't given much depth or complexity, and felt very much like a shounen anime protagonist where his only defining trait is his iron will and determination to be the bestest ever in his chosen fighting style. I don't remember much about the other characters either as I felt they fell into stock action fantasy stereotypes.

The writing style and dialogue was kind of stilted and clunky as well, with some of the interactions between characters being particularly cheesy. I know prose is a subjective thing, and especially in fantasy as it does seem like a lot of readers are fine with the functional Sandersonesque ""window pane"" prose - so YMMV. For me, there was just a bit of a lack of polish on that end. 

The story itself, although fast-paced, was a little one-note and predictable. It just felt like an endless parade of action scenes and after a while they all blur together. Fast-paced is fine but I wish there was some time for some character development and some introspection. Action and magic just by itself can't carry a story imo.

All in all, I was expecting a bit more after the hype but I will also say that Evan Winter does have quite a bit of talent and the ingredients are there in this book fro a promising future. At the very least, even if I didn't really like this one that much, I was still intrigued enough to probably check out the 2nd book in the series.",1
14,"Learn from Your Favorite Authors by Reading with a Critical Eye[Link to the original blog](https://www.campfiretechnology.com/2020/01/learn-from-your-favorite-authors-by-developing-a-critical-eye/)

If you have sought writing advice in the past, you have no doubt been told to read a lot. Stephen King is so serious about reading that he says if you don’t have time to read, then you don’t have time to write. Reading is *that* important to writing. It’s your window into the author’s world, and see how masters of the craft make magic happen on the page.

When you read for pleasure, the story plays out as a movie in your head. You can’t take it so easily when you read to learn. You must dive into the details- dissect the text and see what makes it breathe. This is reading with a critical eye.

To read with a critical eye, rewind back to high school. If you took a literature class, then you already know how to examine a work. You were expected to make arguments about how the writer accomplishes certain goals. Emulate this mindset as you read.

Let’s go to school.

## Learn the Craft

Constantly seek out more knowledge about writing. There are endless guidelines and tropes to learn about and knowing these things will give you insight. How are you supposed to look for something if you don’t know what you’re looking for?

There are endless online resources for learning about writing, from masterclasses to video essays on YouTube. Read critiques of your favorite books. Watch people break down scenes into their components. Read our “Craft” posts. Learning new concepts will allow you to see them play out when you start practicing and reading.

There are endless online resources for learning about writing, from masterclasses to video essays on YouTube. Here’s a list of some of our favorites:

[Hello Future Me (Tim Hickson)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQMO-YL87u-6Rt8hIVsRjA) – Hickson makes video essays on all aspects of writing and worldbuilding. If you are looking for a place to learn how to build a world that feels consistent and lived in, he’s your guy. He also has a book on the subject that you can pick up [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Worldbuilding-I-Timothy-Hickson-ebook/dp/B07PNKHDFZ)

[Overly Sarcastic Productions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodbH5mUeF-m_BsNueRDjcw) – OSP takes old stories and tropes and puts them in a digestible and funny format. If you want to learn about story telling of old or writing structure, they have your back.

[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH3mK1NZn9QqOSj3ObrP3xL8tEJQ12-vL) – If you don’t already know him, Sanderson is a best-selling fantasy author. He has a series of lectures on YouTube where he discusses everything from worldbuilding to publishing.

[Lessons from the Screenplay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw/featured) – LFTS takes deep dives into movies and pulls out invaluable knowledge on how they were crafted. If you are interested in learning how to write great screenplays, check this channel out.

[Daniel Greene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg/featured) – Greene reviews and critiques new book, movie, and television releases. Critiques like his help you learn what doesn’t work so you can avoid it in your writing.

There are tons of subjects to learn about. Whether it be dialogue, the Hero’s Journey, worldbuilding, exposition, characterization, etc., start learning the basics. If you already have a grasp on these concepts, that doesn’t mean you get to skip class. There will always be holes in your knowledge to fill.

One of the big breakthrough learning moments I had was learning about the Hero’s Journey. I started with a theoretical understanding. I knew the steps and what purposes they served in a story, but I didn’t know how it *actually* functioned in storytelling. Then I started looking for it in books and movies. I saw how other creators used it, and my understanding slowly transformed into something more concrete.

You can learn about something, but you will gain a deeper understanding by watching others and practicing.

## Practice

Now it’s time to take all that knowledge and put it to use. Take the concepts you’ve learned and put them on the page. You might not completely understand how to use them at first, and that’s okay. Test yourself.. Make deliberate moves to implement these ideas into your writing.

As you use them more, you will start to hit roadblocks. You’ll be trying to pull something off, and it won’t be working. Maybe you can’t work subtext into your dialogue or you can’t figure out how to work in a crucial step of the Hero’s Journey. It might be uncomfortable. That’s good, it means you’re challenging yourself. Work through the issue, and keep moving forward.

Roadblocks will indicate what you need to study further. The more you practice, the more questions you will have. Those questions will guide your eyes as you read. They will focus your attention on how master storytellers solve those problems.

## Reading Critically

At this point, you’ve learned the rules, you’ve implemented them, and now you have questions. Keep those questions with you as you read. Study how authors work with those concepts. This is where you will gain real insight. Anybody can be told how to write dialogue, but not everybody can write great dialogue. Watch how the masters put all of the pieces together.

Take notes as you read. Anytime the text makes you feel an emotion, make a note. Whenever something grabs your attention, make a note. Whenever you get bored, make a note. These notes will make it easier to dig into the text.

To dive deep into a piece, read it at least twice. First, read it normally. Take some notes, but don’t analyze yet. You want to experience the story as a regular reader. Dig deeper on your second pass.. Reading twice will give you the chance to see details you may have overlooked on the first pass, and those details may help answer your questions. The pieces of the puzzle will be more obvious on the second read.

## Reflection

When you’re done reading, reflect and try to answer questions posed during the practice section. Tackle these one at a time. Pick a question and find the reading notes you’ve made on the subject. Look for all the notes that relate to your question. Then ask more questions. Here’s an example:

Initial Question: How do I make a moment have emotional impact?

Now let’s say you are reading Lord of the Rings, and you get to the part where Gandalf fights the Balrog and is killed. You make a note because it makes you sad.

Now ask the question: Why does that moment make me feel sad?

This question may have multiple answers, and those answers may spawn more questions. I advise using an outline to represent it.

 *Why does that moment make me sad?*

1. I liked Gandalf
   1. *Why do I like Gandalf?*
      1. He cares about Frodo
      2. He has a sense of humor and wisdom
      3. He has cool powers
2. I relate to the other characters’ grief
   1. *Why do I relate to their grief?*
      1. I care about those characters
      2. My father passed away suddenly and Gandalf was like a father figure
3. Gandalf was an important member of the team
   1. *Why does this loss make me feel sad?*
      1. The mission is already so bleak, losing the most powerful team member makes it seem hopeless

There are plenty of avenues you can take here. You could get into dialogue and pacing, or you could get as specific as language and syntax. We’ll stick with the questions I outlined for now.

After creating this series of questions and answers, you can start to draw conclusions. Think about how these answers relate to your initial question.

First, moments are emotional when they affect characters that I enjoy. I enjoy characters when they are fun and relatable. **I should make my characters likeable.**

Second, moments are emotional when I can relate to them. **I should write moments that people can relate to.**

Third, moments are emotional when there are stakes. Stakes raise the tension in a scene and draw out emotion. **I should make my emotional moments have stakes.**

Before starting this process, perhaps your “emotional moments” were relatable and had characters you cared about, but they lacked stakes. Now you have the tool to add stakes to a scene to raise the tension and make them more emotional.

This entire process is about adding things to your toolbelt. The more you do it, the more tools you will gain.

## Miscellaneous Advice

This process doesn’t just work for reading great works. You can apply this to anything, and I advise you try it out with books and movies that you don’t like. While reading good books, you will add tools to your tool belt, but when you read the bad ones, you will learn what not to do. This list will help you avoid bad form and tired tropes.

Don’t get too lost in the weeds trying to find out what the author was *trying* to do. Focus on how it affects you and why. You should only care about the things pertaining to your research questions because of their relevance to your writing. If you go too deep then you risk copying the style of the author you’re learning from, or wasting time trying to decipher their intention. Instead, learn the things relevant to *your* writing so you can establish your own voice.

Write out the lessons that you learn. Keep a log of the things that you’ve learned and how you learned them. Returning to these notes will help keep your tools fresh in your brain. Over time you’ll build up your own personal style guide, and with enough practice, you’ll start using your tools without thinking about it.

## Jazz

Jazz musicians spend years learning and listening. They are experts in music theory. But when the best jazz musicians play, they don’t think about music theory. They channel feelings into music. The theory is in their bones. It’s no longer just an understanding of harmony but a new language – a language they use to speak in ways most can’t.

Read, watch, listen, and write until it is in your bones. Then when you sit down to write, you won’t have to think. You’ll channel feelings into story. The concepts you learned will be second nature. Story will be a language of your own, and that’s the mark of a master.",1

17,"Books where the blurb poorly describes the story?Anyone ever read a book and then after finishing it reread the blurb and realize it was a terrible description?

I'm listening to The White Tower right now and am almost done. I just reread the blurb and in hindsight it does a terrible job of telling what this book is about.

The events it describes do happen in the story but they are hardly the focal points of the story. Some happen very near the end, others are minor aspects of the characters journey.",1
18,"Literary/Epic/New Weird Fantasy in the vein of, say, Senlin Ascends?As the title implies, I'm on the hunt for a specific kind of book...more about the atmosphere and the prose, I think, than the plot. Though I won't say no to a solid plot. 

I want to read something that is literary in prose, epic in scale, and new weird in worldbuilding. If it has all three of those qualities, I'm a happy man -- but two out of three would do. I guess I should also add that I don't mind dark, but I'm not a huge fan of gritty for-the-sake-of; this is one reason I don't like Mieville all that much. While the Books of Babel can get dark, one of the reasons I love them so much is that they are hopeful where it counts: I think hopefulness is a big component that I need in a story in order to connect with it.

If it helps at all, my top three favorites are Lord of the Rings, Jonathan Strange, and Senlin. Perhaps there's a common thread between those three that I'm not seeing, other than the qualities I mention above (I know JS&amp;MN isn't necessarily *weird*, but there is a strange quality to the world due to all the Faerie stuff. Otherworldly, perhaps? That might be the word. It's there in LOTR, too). Whatever the case, any assistance you fine people can give me would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR -- Literary, epic, new weird: that's what I want to read. But not Mieville, thanks.",1
19,"Basilisk Reviews: Prosper's Demon by KJ Park - an absolutely stellar example of Parker's signature wit and humor. A wry, entertaining novella! *Thank you to Tor for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review! Prosper's Demon will be released on January 28th, 2020.*

[/r/Fantasy Bingo](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/r-fantasy-book-bingo/) Squares: Slice of Life (Hard Mode), Novella

Execution: ⭐⭐⭐⭐💫  
Enjoyment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I have an idea you aren’t going to like me very much. That may prove to be the only thing we’ll have in common, so let’s make the most of it.

Prosper’s Demon is an absolutely stellar example of KJ Parker's signature wit. As always, Parker's protagonist is more than a bit of an asshole, but you have to love the wry, humorous prose he's couched in. This would be a great entry point for someone new to Parker's short fiction, given how thoroughly it epitomizes the tone and characters he's known for. Although this novella shares a universe with [My Beautiful Life](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/11/25/my-beautiful-life-by-kj-parker/), they are both stand-alone and independent of one another.

Parker has a penchant for nameless narrators, and Prosper’s Demon continues that trend. It’s an interesting stylistic choice, especially since it’s hardly noticeable up until you begin writing about the book in question. You start to write a sentence saying that &lt;narrator&gt; did such and such, and then you backtrack - wait, what’s his name? DID he have a name? Oh, huh, he *didn’t have a name*. Parker manages to draw you into the head of his characters so thoroughly that you never stop to consider the fact that you don’t even have a word to call them. It’s the purest of first person stream-of-consciousness style narrations, eliminating all the chaff. The reader is meant to BECOME the main character, to insert themselves into the novella, and to experience what it would be like to be such a complete and utter asshole themselves. It’s fascinating. 

The novella opens on, well, a murder scene. And I do mean *opens* on it - the very first sentence describes the corpse lying on the bed. It’s established quite quickly that our anonymous narrator is not the best person out there, given that he’s the murderer. Sure, a demon made him do it - but he also chose to put himself in a position that gave the demon and opening to sneak into him while he was asleep. But, regardless, it’s up to the reader whether or not the good he does balances out the bad, so off goes the body down a nice deep crevasse. Thus does Parker set the stage for this little demon hunting tale. 

&gt;I WOKE TO FIND her lying next to me, quite dead, with her throat torn out. The pillow was shiny and sodden with blood, like low-lying pasture after a week of heavy rain. The taste in my mouth was familiar, revolting, and unmistakable. I spat into my cupped hand; bright red. Oh, for crying out loud, I thought. Here we go again.

Really, though, our dear narrator is less of a hunter and more of a shepherd. The demons can’t die, but they can be shuffled along and weakened. He was born with the ability to see and interact with demons, which is quite rare in this world. He first encountered a demon all the way back when he was in his mother’s womb, when a demon attempted to hide in her and recover after having suffered a grievous injury. This did not go very well for the demon, and likely contributed quite a bit to the somewhat skewed moral compass our narrator now possesses. 

The narrator’s semi-lucrative demon-shepherding trade is sanctioned by the Church, though the demons are working on discrediting the whole institution altogether with mixed success. Sometimes he’s welcomed into villages, and other times he’s given the cold shoulder. On the whole, people are usually glad to see him when they need him but would very much prefer he not wear out his welcome after the demons have been exorcised. Largely, this is due to the fact that exorcisms are messy at best. It is not a clean process to extract a demon. They latch on to their host’s minds, and pulling them out tends to do quite a bit of damage. On the flip side, however, the demons aren’t a huge fan of the exorcism process either - it’s painful in a way that we mere mortals could never understand. Thus, sometimes the best option is to bargain with them and convince them that leaving on their own is in their best interests. 

&gt;Give me five minutes, It said. At which point, you have to make a decision. You consider the amount of damage It’s already done—in this case, a broken leg, because I’d heard it break, and almost certainly a rib or two, high chance of internal bleeding, the little bastards never can resist playing—and then you weigh the harm It’ll do if you leave It in there a moment longer against the havoc It could cause if you have to yank It out. Factor against all that the pain and trauma It’ll feel being extracted, of which It’s so very, very scared; and then you ask yourself, is It really so tired and hungry that It’ll risk being manhandled, or is It simply trying it on, the way They all do, 999 times in 1,000? 

This way of life is all well and good for dear Narrator, right up until he finds a demon inhabiting the premier scholar of their kingdom: the good Master Prosper. It’s quite a subtle little thing, and rather more aesthetically pleasing compared to the ones he’s used to (by which I mean that it looks like a *very* attractive young woman rather than the nasty crabby-gooey things he typically sees). He’s set to be the mentor for the Duchess’ as yet unborn child. Naturally, the unborn child also has a demon inside of it. All around, this is not a great situation for anyone - and so, he bargains. 

&gt;Fine, It said as It saw me scowling in at It through some poor devil’s eyes. I give up. I’ll go quietly. No, you won’t, I said. I’ve got a job for you. You what? You’re going to do something for me, I said. Or I’ll hurt you so badly you’ll remember the pain every day for the rest of your everlasting life. Two pale eyes gazed at me. If I’d been capable of pity, I’d have felt it. You’re serious, aren’t you? About the job, yes. And the pain. Completely stunned. Tens of thousands of years of existence, you think you’ve heard it all, but apparently not. You want me to help you? I nodded. Collaboration, I told It. It’s the next big thing.

In exchange for helping Prosper’s titular demon out with Prosper’s art project, the demon agrees to do a bit less harm in the short term. Sure, our narrator will be assisting with their long game plan, but at least the people in his own generation will feel a bit less pain for it. Tit for tat, after all. As mentioned above: Collaboration is the next big thing. And so, they embark on a quest of artistic vision: to create the large bronze statue in the world. It will be magnificent, glorious, a monument to mankind. It might even be worth the cost. There’s only one way to find out. 

It’s damned impressive how much *fun* Parker makes reading about asshole main characters. You love to hate them. They murder, they make horrible decisions, they lie and cheat and steal. But the prose is light, wry, and witty. His plotting makes it clear contextually that the main character is horrible, and so it never feels apologetic. If anything, it wallows in it, joyfully. Parker makes no attempt whatsoever to truly justify the actions of his characters, and it makes for an entertaining and hilarious read about awful human beings. It almost reminds me of a Quentin Tarantino film, if Tarantino wasn’t a foot fetishist and was actually witty. 

Anyway, the real takeaway here: I thoroughly enjoyed this novella, and you should read it too if you like witty assholes who shepherd around demons.

Legendary beasts and men banded together in a suicide mission to stop the war, meeting them in a final battle where the emperor and the dragonlord were killed.

Only her two brothers, one a recently liberated apprentice who has his own secret power, and the other a drunk still trying to forget their father’s death, stand in the way of the generals bringing Emperor Abaddon back to life.*

*If only the emperor would remain dead, so all the other sagias could live.*

I know how and what people ate, that tables were loose boards, stuff like that, but aside from that, not much.

- was an inn run by a family, or was there staff?

- what kind of roles/jobs were there and who performed them? Things like cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, serving guests..?

- did locals frequent the inn for a drink or meal?

- how did the innkeeper get their supplies? Did they go to the local market, did merchants come to the inn to deliver?

- did the inn brew their own beer/ale/wine?

- how much would it cost to stay in an inn?

- would an inn keep regulars, like rent out rooms for an indefinite time?

Thank you so much!",1

Oh boy. That was a ride. And a whole lot of important stuff happened. Ivy kidnapped, tortured, Nicodemus hoping to turn her and have a Fallen Archive. Marcone kidnapped and tortured. Mab stealing Harry's fire. Luccio and Harry flirting. The rescues of the aforementioned victims. Harry have premonition sight about the island. Elder Gruff. Strangling Nicodemus. Michael nearly killed. HOLY SHIT the end of this book is intense. And to top it all off, Charity calls Harry family and he scores a date with Luccio. Boy, oh boy, that was a RIDE.

And it won't be slowing down until Ghost Story. In fact, we're about to kick it up again next month and then March will bring Changes and hoo boy, newbies, that one is a doozy. Remember to tag spoilers for the newbies!

Which also means we'll need to figure out scheduling for April or May. I've got Ghost Story up for April already but once we finish Changes, we could read Side Jobs, the first short story collection. At the very least, I'm going to recommend you get Side Jobs anyways so we can read ""Aftermath"" with Changes. It takes place directly after the end of Changes from Murphy's POV. So if y'all want to read the whole collection, I'm down, but for sure I think we should tack ""Aftermath"" to the end of Changes. There are some others that are fun and add some flavor to what came before (Billy and Georgia's wedding) but that's the big one, at least until after Skin Game. There's one story in Brief Cases I think we should read before Peace Talks/with Skin Game that we'll talk more about after Changes. We could also read Brief Cases in full after Skin Game as well giving everyone time to *get* Peace Talks.

I am open to suggestions. We could also do a read of the comics as well. They all slot in various points in between books and function a lot like the shorts. I'll have a comment down below for opinions on what to do here.

25,"The sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang – my review (and it’s not all good)This book is the front runner for the SPFBO and I’m yet to see a single review about it that isn’t glowing. An deservingly so! This book oozes character and atmosphere. It’s fresh, surprising and it packs a punch that leaves you breathless on the floor.

I didn’t like it.

Because I can’t really talk about this book without going into spoiler territory, I’ll provide a quick description first and my impressions broadly.

It takes place in a Fantasy world on a peninsula in an empire heavily inspired by feudal Japan. The magic system is very similar to the one in Avatar: the last airbender. The protagonists are Misako, a housewife who used to have a violent past and Mamoru, her first 14 year old first born. They belong to a noble warrior class rumored to be the best in the world, able to control water and ice, and Mamoru is training to be the best of the bests. 

Once again it’s a powerful story and you should read it. As for me I have a couple of nitpicks that I could have easily ignore but what really stopped me from enjoying it was the pacing. It was too damn slow. It was intense when it needed to be, but the rest of the time I just kept turning pages waiting for the next story beat. Unfortunately in order to discuss about it more, I’ll have to go into spoiler territory. Don’t read further if you haven’t read the book first.

-------------------------------------------------


Ok, so here are my issues. I already know what you’re going to answer for each of my point: that it was the point, that I didn’t understand what the author was trying to do, that I’m the one being wrong and that I’m a dumbass and I deserve to die a painful death for having this opinion. I completely agree with you. I understand completely what the author was trying to do and I know that I’m the one being wrong, but understanding it is different from enjoying it so I consider my opinion valid nonetheless.

First the pacing. There are two parts in the books. The before and the after with a huge battle in the middle. There is an interesting confrontation between Mamoru and his father during the first part and there is an interesting and powerful confrontation between Misako and his husband. I found those scenes very good but unfortunately I was bored out of my mind between those scenes. The worst part was those long scenes after the huge battle where everyone is mourning their loss. I understand the point of those scenes but it was both painful and boring. I think my problem is that I have to root for the protagonist in order to enjoy they journey, and I did ended up rooting for them at the end, but at first I just wanted to slap them in the face until they stopped being morons. I was surprised with the death of Mamoru. It was a ballsy move, even since George RR Martin I kind of expect something like that every time there are several POV.

I also have issues with the worldbuilding. It felt incoherent. At first it looked like a medieval setting but they kept mentioning modern appliance elsewhere in the world and it was jarring. I didn’t know if I was in “Avatar the last airbender” or if I was in “Legend of Korra”. They didn’t provide any explanation why only one character had a smartphone for instance. This community was very traditional but they weren’t luddites either. And on the other hand there wasn’t any “practical” application of their power. When a sensible portion of your population has magic power we should expect for it to be used outside battle scenes. There were one or two instances where they used it to wash themselves or to solidify a structure but it was pretty limited, specially for a village of fishermen where I can imagine a buttload of useful applications.

Also, why use Japanese for so many words? I wasn’t lost because it turned out that I studied Japanese in the past but not everyone is like me. I imagine it would just complicate their understanding of the story. Why use weird units for the time? Why not call a teacher a teacher instead of a sensei? I’m French so does it mean that I could also create an exotic fantasy world by randomly saying some of the nouns in French? Instead of saying “ the student had to pick up his sword in order to meet his fencing teacher” I could write “the étudiant had to pick up his épée in order to meet his escrime professeur”. Is it exotic enough for you?

I also felt frustrated by the lack of resolution with a lots of narrative setup. What’s the story with those orphans being kidnapped? How did it turned out with the empire now that the village had its eyes opened? I discovered after the fact that the story is a kind of prequel for a series with Robin and his son so I imagine I’ll have to read the rest to really understand.

My last issue is very personal but I hate hate HATE the trope about the oppressed that end up falling in love with her oppressor. When I discovered how Misaki was being treated by her abusive husband I kept praying for the story not to go there and unfortunately my prayers were not answered. I was ok for him to redeem himself. I was ok for her to forgive him. I was not ok for her to fall in love with him in the end. You can provide all the justification that you want: how he changed, how he stared seeing her as an equal. Bullshit! It stinks of the Stockholm syndrome.

I apologize for this long review. Once again, I acknowledge that this is a good book and it’s just not for me. I usually hate writing bad review about books from new authors because I they need all the help they can have but because I felt alone with my opinion I had to exorcise it somehow. 

This is just me: it’s a truly powerful book and all the problems are on my side.",1

It's a ghost story/murder mystery set in 1890s Malaysia. Lim Tian Ching, the spoiled son of a rich family died unmarried, and his mother seeks to find him a wife who would marry him postmortem, so he would not spend eternity alone and to placate his spirit. Her choice falls on Pan Li Lan, the daughter of an impoverished spice trader. This would help Li Lan's family, but at the cost of her happiness.

In Alix E. Harrow, I see a respect for stories and words and the power they hold equal to that of Ursula K. Le Guin. If you’ve followed me awhile, you know the depth of this compliment and if you haven’t, boy, have I a few recommendations for you. But this isn’t about Ursula, it’s about *The Ten Thousand Doors of January,* a novel that takes a magnifying glass and points it at the connection between stories, the worlds they originate from and those who are brave enough to explore them.

January Scaller is a unique girl, though in what way may not become readily apparent. True, she is “a perfectly unique specimen,” as her guardian, Mr. Locke puts it, a child grown up under the wing of this most affluent personage. “A perfectly unique specimen, odd-colored perhaps but not colored” is the description this man, almost a father to her, gives January early on. It is the turn of the 20th century, and this is America – if you needed a reminder of the disquiet, the sheer horrible racist reality of that time, the following sentence, from the view of a seven-year old, encapsulates it well: “I didn’t really know what made a person colored or not, but the way he \[Mr. Locke\] said it made me glad I wasn’t.” See, in only a few paragraphs, Harrow has given us a conflicting view of the man January considers a father figure.

Not that January doesn’t have a father; it is merely that he, Julian Scaller, spends most of his time tracking treasures and rare objects for his employer, the very same Mr. Locke. Cornelius Locke is something of a collector, you see, and his home would make even the Smithsonian seem an enthusiast’s collection by comparison. January’s father is his most successful agent, owed to Julian’s ability to follow stories to their source – the stories of people and of places, the origins behind their myths

It is a talent his daughter seems to have inherited, for it isn’t the dotting of a millionaire that makes her “a perfectly unique specimen” but the hunger she feels for stories and adventures, for the world outside the confines of Locke House. Like many of you who now read this review – like me – January escapes the tedium of her everyday reality through novels – penny dreadfuls and adventure stories, the horror and excitement of the grotesque. And when, on her seventeenth birthday, life throws at her the very worst it has to offer, it’s into a book that she escapes.

&gt;**“…(see how that word slips into even the most mundane of stories? Sometimes I feel there are doors lurking in the creases of every sentence, with periods for knobs and verbs for hinges).**

The Villains (see the shape of the V, how it places opposites on its two ends, mirroring one another and yet different?) of *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* range from the universal gothic of the time period to the deeply personal, the kind of villain to kill for – if you’ll pardon the pun.

Its the language, the melodious nature of it that is enchanting to the reader. The masterful control over character voice is equally impressive – a sizable portion of the book adopts the tenets of an epistolary novel, making use of a voice very different from January’s own:

&gt;**The following monograph concerns the permutations of a repeated motif in world mythologies: passages, portals, and entryways. Such a study might at first seem to suffer from those two cardinal sins of academia—frivolity and triviality—but it is the author’s intention to demonstrate the significance of doorways as phenomenological realities.**  
**At least, that is the book I intended to write, when I was young and arrogant. Instead, I’ve written something strange, deeply personal, highly subjective. I am a scientist studying his own soul, a snake swallowing its own tail.**

Harrow’s use of these chapters to tell several stories serves to pace January’s own tale and to create additional tension early on,

I return then to Alix Harrow’s respect of words, captured best in the following: “**Words and their meanings have weight in the world of matter, shaping and reshaping realities through a most ancient alchemy.**” This is at the heart of our culture, did you know? Our society and we as members of it, invent and reinvent ourselves through the process of the word, written or spoken. Our civilization rests on the written word, where many have perished before, their words once spoken but no longer heard. And this novel *gets it*, understands the importance of words and their ability to change minds and hearts and the paths we make for ourselves.

There’s also the emotional connection – something deeply individual for all readers – but the novel and its characters, their suffering and loss and love and joy as they realized themselves in full, all this found resonance in me. About mid-way through, I even teared up, and there’s nothing like a few tears to illustrate how deeply you connect to a text on an emotional level.

I’m under the impression that this novel is a standalone – and I would like to praise the author for her choice; *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* accomplishes in one book what many series don’t manage in three – a complete story from beginning to end, which leaves the door…not sealed, not entirely, but firmly closed.

I give *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* a score of 5/5 stars; if I were using a ten-point system, I’d give it a 9.5 out of 10 because the ending plays it a little bit too safe and the epilogue, while a wonderful way to say goodbye to the characters, wasn’t necessary. Almost as if Harrow wanted one last moment with these characters – something I can hardly blame her for.

My recommendation goes out to all those among you who are in love with the magic of words and stories, those of you who feel a certain disquiet when they think of having to spend a lifetime going through the motions; *The Ten Thousand Doors* is for adventurers and travelers and seekers. Take a look – I wager you won’t regret it.

39,"The color out of space - The best evoker of creepiness and dread?I just read Lovecraft's the color out of space.

Now, Lovecraft is very well known for being able to arouse (not like that) dread in his stories but truth be told, I'm not someone who's felt this way after trying to force myself to read 'the mountains of madness' and 'call of cthulhu'. I've completed my readings of 'the nameless city' (though there were good parts to this one) and 'the festival' and was almost similarly unimpressed.

&amp;nbsp;

However the color out of space is a different beast altogether. Lovecraft managed to evoke dread via so many means: the fear of the people who lived near Nahum, the dread of his friend, the land itself perishing, Nahum's family succumbing to madness, animals seized by terror, all these devices just brought about a sense of fear and hopelessness about this situation. I've read novels that've tried to evoke a sense of dread but I've found myself unmoved by them, here however the very *world* around Nahum's farm is touched by the horror of the story. Nahum's friend Ammi is scarred by the dread he felt when he visited his friend so long ago (the events of the story took place many years ago, possibly five decades ago), and he makes you understand just how terrifying it was for him to force himself to go check on his friend every so often. His very choices were also influenced by his fear (for example taking the long way when leaving Nahum's home, just to stay away from where the meteor had landed).

&amp;nbsp;

Then you have the very plant life around Nahum's home. The fruits growing to large sizes and full of vibrant colors, but within they were unfit to consume, as though something fundamental had gone wrong. First the trees succumbed to whatever was ailing the land and the grass was untouched, but then so was the grass and their livestock. Their animals grew sickly and shriveled, almost as though some alien radiation was ravaging them. The very *world* around Nahum's home was just *wrong*. Even the image of the sun changed once you were within a certain radius of the meteor.

&amp;nbsp;

And the people of the surrounding lands, they were too scared to ever go near Nahum's home. They chose to instead find *other* ways so they didn't have to experience his lands. So great was their fear that even in the framing story they'd decided it was all myth and that no one should ever believe Ammi, as though they could hide the horrors of Nahum's farm by simply forgetting it or treating it as a myth.

&amp;nbsp;

Nahum's wife and one of his sons both going mad, now THIS had some of the strangest nuance I'd ever read, as it mentioned that though they both screamed and screamed, it was though they communicated to one another in some alien form by their very screams. Nahum's wife had somehow been made privy to...knowledge? Sights? Something that was breaking her mind. By the end of it all, she is consumed by whatever is living in the lands, not out of malice, but because the color does not seem to recognize sentience or people, just that it feeds as it wishes. Ammi is then pushed to kill what she's become because he fears that it is a great evil to just leave her as is.

&amp;nbsp;

All this and the 'creature' is not one with a face that can show hunger/anger/delight or whatever. The very 'creature', the color, does not even make itself evident for much of the story, the dread is what is built up first before we've ever even seen it. An entire story with a creature that doesn't even have a form, it's almost unthinkable to imagine how a storyteller could tell an entire story with this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not crazy about everything Lovecraft's written, but this story has been so powerful. I'm not going to say I'm a fan of his prose, but he certainly does amazing things with imagery. I'm hoping to one day finish 'the mountains of madness' as I really think it'll be one of my favorites if I can just get past the part where they finally reach the mountains (it's so tedious up until that point, but then this was also the first story of his I'd read so it's possible I wasn't yet accustomed to his way of writing). I really haven't read any other story that knew how to evoke such feelings of dread without being so heavy handed with it.",1

41,"Shadow of what was Lost issueI like the book. It hits some nostalgic tropes which I'm craving right now.

I'm almost done with book 1, about 2 or 3 chapters left but there was an issue bothering me that I couldn't figure out till now.

It's their age. I can't place it.

The cast starts off at a school setting before they go off on their journey and so I assumed and put them somewhere in their mid-teens. They also don't act/think like adults, but more adolescent.

My issue is that they're not exactly acknowledged as under-age. Sometimes the term 'lad' is used, but it's not really reflected well with the attitude and behaviors other characters have to the main cast. Most if not all interactions with Davian, Wirr, Asha, Dezia, Aelric, and Karaliene are very ""equal"" as if theyre adults themselves. Their age isn't really an issue to other characters especially during the more eventful scenes where you'd think it would.

Maybe I've assumed wrong and they're in their early 20s. Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks!",1

**First Row**

Slice of Life / Small Scale Fantasy (Not record of a Spaceborn Few) – **The Gray House** by Mariam Petrosyan

* After /u/improperly_paranoid/ talked this book up at length, I decided to check it out. The book is a grade A door stopper at close to 750 pages but it reads a lot quicker than it seems like it should partly because the story is really engaging and partly because the novel is dialogue-heavy which makes the story both flow more quickly while also taking up less page space than it could. The characters are well realized and the House itself is so well sketched as a vaguely unsettling weird place that has such an effect on their lives and carries such odd and unique traditions within it. It does take a few hundred pages for the true plot to kick in (and for the magical realist elements of the story to assert themselves) but the characters and their idiosyncrasies are so compelling that I found it easy to read through the somewhat plotless first third without difficulty. A remarkable book that's worth checking out. 4/5

A SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability (Main Character) – **Six of Crows** by Leigh Bardugo

* Six of Crows was a fun read and a lot more violent than I was expecting for a teen fantasy novel. Main character Kaz Brekker is permanently crippled and needs to use a cane but his injury has basically turned him into a fantasy Walter White, willing to do anything and everything it takes to gain power and get revenge on those who wronged him. The world was rather interesting and I enjoyed the magic system. The heist aspect of the book was solid though sometimes it felt like the situation wasn't explained quite well enough for me to visualize exactly what was happening with each team member in order for the mission to be pulled off successfully. 3.5/5

SFF Novella (not Tor Published) – T**he Tea Master and the Detective** by Aliette de Bodard

* I read this while pretty sick so I think I probably missed some details that take this story from good to great but I still liked it a lot. The way Bodard updated Holmes and Watson for a sci fi setting was rather ingenious (I particularly like making Watson a sentient spaceship/apothecary). The characters are well realized though I wished they had had a greater variety of interactions since much of this book is characterized by antagonism between them that seemed to resolve into friendship rather abruptly. Maybe this is an area where the book was constrained by being an update of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories but since I've never actually read the first one, I can't be sure. Regardless, it's a satisfying and well written mystery  that's easy to read through in a single sitting. 4.5/5

Self-Published SFF Novel (&lt;50 GR ratings) – **The Final Lesson** by Shakyra Dunn

* I combed the 2018 SPFBO entries looking for an author with under 50 ratings to find Dunn and while not the best book I read this year, it was an enjoyable one. The magic system is a bit conventional but the character relationships are strong with the central character of Leilana learning to be nearer to humanity so that the cost of her magical powers won't eventually drive her mad. There were also a few surprising and bold choices in the writing including an early betrayal from a character who seemed to sweet and innocent to do that sort of thing (which also served as a great example of why it was so important that Leilana learns to connect to humanity before her powers consume her). The plotting was a bit uneven after the strong opening though and some of the dialogue could be a bit too expository but I still came away mostly enjoying it. 3/5

SFF Novel Featuring Twins (as protagonists) – **Black Tides of Heaven** by JY Yang

* Twins Mokoya and Akeha are powerful in a loosely explained magical power called slackcraft and they are seen by their mother, the Protector of the Tensorate, as the key to controlling the people. A rift comes between them near their 18th birthday when Mokoya reveals that they want to be confirmed as a woman upon her 18th birthday (children in this world are kept genderless until they choose which gender to become in a confirmation ceremony where they are magically and surgically ushered through puberty in a day) and Akeha chooses to become a man out of spite. This simple sibling rupture captures a lot of interesting ideas about gender and power and sibling relationships and I found myself really enjoying it. My one complaint is that since it is so short (barely 240 pages) it often felt like the plot was rushing and major events were being skipped over where I would have appreciated them being drawn out more. Regardless, it was a great read. 4.5/5

**Second Row**

Novel Featuring Vampires (as protagonists) – **Sunshine** by Robin McKinley

* I've heard such good things about Robin McKinley and in the big recommendation thread quite a few people mentioned this as being one of her best and a perfect fit for this square so I figured this was a good time to finally try her works. This book is chock full of personality and a unique approach to both magic and vampirism that made it immediately interesting to me. Set in a world full of demons and magic that have remade society into a loosely defined worldwide defensive pact between humans to protect themselves from an encroaching menace of vampires. Within this world, Rae is a sunlight mage who finds that as long as she is holding hands with a Vampire (specifically Constantine) she can grant them temporary immunity from burning up in the daylight. The novel is fast paced and has tons of fascinating worldbuilding. I found it very easy to read hundreds of pages in a single sitting because of how captivating the voice was. 4/5

Format: Graphic Novel (new to you) – **Heathen** by Natasha Alterici

* In the big rec thread, /u/E_L_Sonder told me about this graphic novel and it sounded perfect for my needs. Heathen is a fantastic graphic novel about a lesbian Viking warrior who wishes to overthrow the old order because it sentenced her to death for daring to kiss another woman. To this end, she sets out to free the Valkyrie leader, Brynhild, and together they decide to overthrow the god-king Odin.  Everything from the art to the characterization in this volume was striking. The characters are already fully realized and feel so real and varied. Every character has a strong motivation for something and a lot of personality to work with that already makes the world feel so rich. Though not much happens in this first volume, I am intrigued to see where this story goes. 4/5

SFF Novel by a Local to You Author (closest local author you can find) – **Twenty-Sided Sorceress** by Annie Bellet

* Portland has no shortage of great spec fic authors to choose from but I ultimately decided to challenge myself to pick someone I'd never heard of (otherwise I would have just wound up reading Le Guin yet again which, while great, reading plenty of authors I already know I like probably isn't in the spirit of this challenge) and wound up with this interesting number. An urban fantasy in the mold of Iron Druid, this book follows sorceress Jade Crow, a magic-user who can imitate any D&amp;D spell she's ever red with the help of a d20 magical focus, as she tries to protect a magical community of shifters (people who can transform into animals) from being killed by a warlock. The pacing is tight and the plot kicks in quickly but the short length of the novel also means that emotionally meaningful moments happen a bit too quickly to really land with a key example being that Jade and her eventual love interest share maybe 10 full pages of time together during which they swing from intense hatred to all-consuming love. However, the plot is interesting and the world gets built pretty quickly so I would call it an entertaining read. 3/5

SFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting (over 50% ocean setting) – **Circe** by Madeline Miller

* I'm not 100% positive that this is exactly ""over 50% ocean setting"" but Circe is a naiad (water nymph) who lives a significant portion of her life underwater and sometimes sails places and even when she's not in the water she lives on a small island surrounded by nothing but ocean and thinks often of the sea so I'm guessing it's close enough no one will give me a hard time about it. This book is a fascinating character study of the semi evil sorceress of The Odyssey and Miller does a great job capturing her complexity and making her sympathetic. The book is half love letter to Greek mythology, half empowered revisionism as Miller spins exciting webs of connection between Circe and other gods/heroes. I really enjoyed this one and can easily see why it won the Goodreads best fantasy novel category in 2018. 4/5

Cyberpunk (not Neuromancer, not Snow Crash) – **Synners** by Pat Cadigan

* I had never heard of Pat Cadigan until I deliberately Googled for female cyberpunk authors and learned pretty immediately there is a widely acknowledged queen of cyberpunk who has been just as influential and prolific as Gibson. This book was...a trip. I'm lost for other words to describe it with. The prose is jazzy and clips at a good pace but the parachuting in method of storytelling and what seems like a very loose focus on several characters who are unrelated to each other for large sections of the book rather than on a straightforward plot makes the book difficult to follow. I was more than halfway through the novel before I finally caught on to what was happening. Despite all that, I still think it was a good book but I'd probably have to reread it very carefully to actually make sure. A fascinating, if confusing, work that makes me intrigued to check out more from the author. 3/5

**Third Row**

2nd Chance (already hard) – **The Thief** by Megan Whalen Turner

* This book is often thrown around as an underrated gem that more people should read but I have to say that the first time I read it, it was a slog without characters that interested me and I couldn't see what people liked about it. Sadly, rereading it only improved the experience a little bit. There are moments which are clever in hindsight once you know the ending but I find that the book is bogged down by tons of pointless detail as if the focus of the story were on describing lunches rather than planning a daring theft. Whole sections stop dead to describe the food the main character, Gen, and the magus and the guards eat or the inn they stay at but little happens that is actually meaningful. The characters begin as rudimentary cutouts that eventually develop mild amounts of character but it never goes much further than archetypal characterization (the nice guard and the mean guard, the ambitious mage, the clever thief, etc.). The best parts of the book are easily the stories about the gods that the characters sometimes tell each other which is frustrating because those stories are straight lore dumps but they display far more economical storytelling than the rest of the book. There's actually a paragraph in the book that stops what little plot there is so one of the guards can recite a list of trivial facts about a nearby country (including primary imports *and* exports!) leading to Gen making fun of how boring and uninteresting such a bland recitation of pointless info is but, honestly, that section didn't seem all too different from the way the rest of the book is written. 1.5/5 stars.

Afrofuturism (&lt;1000 GR ratings) – **The New Moon’s Arms** by Nalo Hopkinson

* Here's the first author I got to check out from /u/thequeensownfool's Author Appreciation threads that helped me fill out my bingo card. The book has a lot of things going on from a magical realist plot about the main character beginning to attract lost objects to her to a somewhat sci fi near future plot about a subset of humanity evolving into mermaids off the coast of a fictional Caribbean island to an exploration of sexuality and aging. Because the book jumps around in time, the main character has fantasies that sometimes blur the line between real and imagined events, and the book is written in a Caribbean-infused dialect of English, it can be surprisingly hard to unpack what I think is ultimately a straightforward story. The book is certainly interesting and well written but the difficulty in piecing everything together for a fairly simple story about family and belonging did hamper my enjoyment of it a bit. 3/5

SFF Novel Published in 2019 (debut) – **Descendant of the Crane** by Joan He

* Princess Hesina is hell bent on uncovering who murdered her father but what she actually uncovers is conspiracy after conspiracy arrayed against her. This book was well-paced and the plot is quite strong with several twists that kept hooking me in. The characters were fantastic from Hesina to Akira to Caiyan, all are given moments to shine and to impress you as a reader and they never disappoint. The Chinese-inspired world may be a little rote in execution with predictable elements like wise sages and Confucianist religious elements but the magic system that is laid out (which I can't really explain too much of without spoiling the book) is interesting and opens the door for lots of possibilities in the sequel. Lastly, the themes of good governance and oppression, while perhaps standard for a fantasy book like this, were handled quite well especially in how Ms. He showed the psychological and emotional toll it took on Hesina to rule when she was forced to take actions she disagreed with even if they were for the greater good. 4/5

Middle Grade SFF Novel (not a reread) – **Akata Witch** by Nnedi Okorafor

* I was pretty worried about this square. I mean, YA is one thing but can I really find a book meant explicitly for only 8-14 year olds that would actually be good? It turns out: yes, quite easily and it'll wind up being so good it was my favorite thing I read in 2019. Okorafor is beloved for her Binti series (which I haven't read yet) and from this book I can see why. I was blown away by her style and command of characters right from the first chapter. Reading this book was like reading your first fantasy for the very first time all over again because of the unique influences she pulls in that I have not seen portrayed in this genre before. The characters are well done and extremely likable, the world is fascinating, and I could not put this book down. Consider me hooked. 5/5

A Personal Recommendation from [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy) (not the most recommended) – **Miranda in Milan** by Katherine Duckett

* You can see me asking for recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b83oxq/the_2019_rfantasy_bingo_recommendations_list/ejvr8n7/?context=3) along with the responses I got. It looked like of the recommendations I was given, Becky Chambers and RF Kuang were the most popular so I couldn't use them here for hard mode. Of the recommendations that were left (and there were more than a few interesting ones), I wound up most drawn to Miranda in Milan. The story follows Miranda, daughter of the sorcerer Prospero (characters from Shakespeare's The Tempest), after they have returned to Italy so Prospero can reclaim his dukedom. Miranda begins to learn of society as she struggles with the realization that she is gay (something she had not known before having grown up on an island with only men) with the help of her maid, Dorothea. The plot begins to ramp up when Miranda realizes that her father has really returned to wreak revenge and she must figure out what his purpose is and how to stop him. The story is well paced, well written, full of interesting characters, and hard to put down. 4.5/5

**Fourth Row**

Any [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy) Book Club Book of the Month OR [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy) Read-along Book (current and participate) – **City of Brass** by SA Chakraborty

* This book had been on my list for a while and it was a pleasure to finally knock it off. City of Brass focuses on djinn society in the Middle East (or Daevas as the call themselves) and is a masterclass in worldbuilding. Every location is imbued with so much history and personality in a way few travel narratives ever are. The magic and the creatures that inhabit the world are intriguing and fascinating with minor twists on classic middle eastern folklore that make them recognizable yet also singular. Many of the characters were interesting and great to follow though the plot could sometimes drag, especially in the chapters where the prince  of the djinn was the POV character. Overall though, I enjoyed it a good bit and I'm excited to read the sequel. 4/5

Media Tie-In Novel (not Star Wars) – **Mass Effect Andromeda: Annihilation** by Catherynne M Valente

* I thought for sure this would be the worst square but was pleasantly surprised to find a genuinely great media tie in novel. I'd never read Valente before this square (despite many great users here assuring me she is a talented writer) but with this as an indication of how well she writes, I'm prepared to cosign that she is indeed a great talent. Set in the Mass Effect world (which my girlfriend went to great lengths to get me into at the beginning of last year), the novel follows all of the lesser races of the galaxy (elcor, batarian, volus, hanar, and drell) as they attempt to travel to a new galaxy to colonize it only for an unexpected virus to begin infecting all species on the ship and killing them off - something which should be impossible for any virus since cross species contamination is rare. The novel is witty and carefully considered with each character getting moments of great humor and great introspection that truly builds their character. By far the best character was an elcor doctor who wanted to be a Shakespearean actor named Yorrik who steals scene after scene. I really enjoyed this and if anyone is interested, I'd highly recommend getting the audiobook version where the narrator has access to all of the vocal effects that the various races have in game since it makes it a bit easier to tell all of the characters apart. 4/5

Novel Featuring an AI Character (as protagonist) – **Ancillary Sword** by Ann Leckie

* After Leckie made a huge splash with Ancillary Justice in the far back forgotten year of 2014, I rushed to pick up the first book in this series and enjoyed it immensely. It's really a shame I waited until this long to check out the sequel but sci-fi really isn't my usual hobby horse and there were tons of great fantasy to read. Breq, the AI formerly known as the warship Justice of Toren, is charged by the Lord of the Radch herself with unearthing disparate consciousnesses of the Lord of the Radch that are fighting with herself and causing chaos throughout the Radch Empire. While Breq remains an interesting character in her own right, this book lacks the tight focus of the original on Breq's revenge and the pacing suffers for it. Leckie juggles several complicated plotlines pretty well and makes what should be a more confusing plot easy to follow but the story doesn't advance nearly as much as I thought it would for the second part of a three part series. Ultimately, I'd say the book is solid to good but a far cry from its predecessor. I can only hope the finale, Ancillary Mercy, can bring it all back home with some of the pizzaz that the original book had. 3.5/5

SFF Novel That Has a Title of Four or More Words (7 words or more) – **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

* Our beloved bingo hosts have been hyping up this book for years so it only made sense that I should finally check it out. And, unsurprisingly, the hype is deserved. The novel is joyous in celebrating the interactions between all of the diverse species and in its optimism about our ability to fit into a galactic federation of some sort in the future. The characters were incredible, so varied and multi-faceted with each having at least one quality that makes them lovable and distinct in addition to coming from highly interesting cultures. At times, this book reminded me of the best of classic Star Trek for its sheer utopianism and creativity but the the novel never fails to always center the text squarely back on the characters and their relationships with each other as a believable makeshift family. I can't recommend this book more highly. 5/5

Retelling! (of an already published book) – **Miranda and Caliban** by Jacqueline Carey

* I guess technically Shakespeare's The Tempest is a play and not a book but hopefully that's small potatoes and besides, I couldn't resist getting in two books about Miranda on the same bingo card. This book reimagines Miranda and Caliban growing up together as rebellious children who long to become lovers despite Prospero's insistence that they never interact. Dealing with themes of betrayal and knowledge, it's an interesting look at forbidden love. Though the prose is not as good as Miranda in Milan, it was generally good overall and I enjoyed the characters as they were written. My biggest complaint is that it stays too true to the ending of The Tempest where I would have preferred it if Carey had played around with it a bit more like Duckett did in her book. Still a worthwhile read though. 3.5/5

**Fifth Row**

SFF Novel by an Australian Author (small press or self-pubbed) – **The Swan Book** by Alexis Wright

* I decided to try making this square even more challenging by seeking out Aboriginal Australian auathors for this square and I was not disappointed by what I found. The Swan takes place in a dystopian future where climate change has ruined the world and aboriginal Australians live under a kind of tyranny from the transformed Australian government. The book has an unusual bitter fairy tale tone due to the protagonist (Oblivia) being caught in a kind of arrested development where she remains childlike well into adulthood. The prose is stellar and the unique tone makes this dystopian novel oddly enchanting even as it lashes out with ferocious political satire against past Australian abuses of aboriginal peoples. It's a remarkable book in many ways though it does require a ton of attention to ferret out what the narration is getting at sometimes since Oblivia relays what happens but in a detached and not always factual manner. 4/5

The Final Book of a Series (published more than a decade ago) – **Assassin’s Quest** by Robin Hobb

* Aha! My laziness in taking months or even years to finish series finally pays off! I was never the biggest fan of this series, I thought the first book was only okay and I only read the second one (which was good but I still didn't think it was great) after being blown away by Liveship Traders. This book is easily the best of the trilogy. Here, I finally see Hobb reaching the levels of writing talent that would amaze me in Liveship Traders. Fitz's lonely quest to assassinate his uncle, Regal, is surprisingly moving given that he's cut off from just about every character we've grown to know over the past two books for much of this book. How Robin Hobb managed to tell such a great story while also isolating her main character and eliminating interpersonal interactions with most of the other likable characters for more than half of the book, I'll never know but it's an incredible feat for any writer to pull off. The conclusion of this trilogy is a well stuck landing that wraps up several loose threads in a satisfying way. Now I'm excited to see where the successor series go from here. 4.5/5

\#OwnVoices (author and protagonist share 2+ marginalized identities) – **An Unkindness of Ghosts** by Rivers Solomon

* This story essentially reproduces the set up of the United States' antebellum South on a spaceship that's supposed to be ferrying everyone to a promised land and the main character, Aster, is a talented doctor who is given semi-privileged status despite her dark skin because of her talent. Aster is a unique character who exists in several liminal spaces: she's both privileged from the point of view of the women she works with and not privileged enough to avoid being harassed by the guards and overseers, she is a revolutionary but finds herself often having to aid the upper class she wants to rebel against, she was born a woman but uses her medical knowledge to try to erase her womanhood to avoid being sexualized (often preferring to be called ""they"" though the story still calls her ""her"" frequently which lead to some uncertainty over which pronouns I should use to refer to her in this post). All of these characteristics make for a truly engaging protagonist who manages to carry much of the book alongside the equally compelling Surgeon, a light-skinned black man who occupies a position of authority by virtue of the fact that he can pass for white. The worldbuilding here is excellent and the prose is often just as good. Unfortunately the book is hampered by incredibly slow pacing, taking close to 70 pages before the plot kicks in, and chapter beginnings would often feel disjointed since they usually began in media res of a new action (and sometimes on a new day) without connecting back to the previous chapter. It's a solid if sometimes uneven read from a promising new writer. 3.5/5

LitRPG (written by female author) – **The Luckless** by AM Sohma

* I'm generally not a fan of LitRPG. I get why people are a fan of it and it can be creative and interesting but as a genre, but it tends to be far more interested in the aspects of writing I find least interesting and least interested in the aspects I adore. The Luckless is about a girl who is trapped in an online fantasy quest due to a server malfunction and must try to beat the game's supposedly unbeatable final boss which will automatically boot her from the full virtual reality immersion tank she will most likely be trapped in otherwise. It's basically just the first arc of Sword Art Online but with a ticking clock added to drive up the tension (and the good part of SAO but with more tension is a compliment as far as I'm concerned). That said, I'm still not really a fan of this genre so the constant stopping to explain battle mechanics in detail really wore on me and slowed down the pacing despite the clever conceit and likable characters. Still, I was able to get through it so I guess I'll call it passable. 2.5/5

Five SFF Short Stories (anthology or collection) – **Ancient, Ancient** by Kiina Ibura Salaam

* This was another author I found through /u/thequeensownfool. Salaam is a fascinating writer with a real focus on sensuality, the destruction of bodies, predatory behaviors, misery, cycles of abuse, and empathy in the face of all those things. Her writing has an almost hypnotic quality to it and her best stories (such as MalKai's Last Seduction and K-USH: The Legend of the Last Wero) really meditate on human connection in the face of isolation. The downside of these stories is that, while they are all incredibly inventive and packed with unique mythologies, they can be tricky to follow because of how many unexplained mysteries there are. I found the best way to read this collection is to almost tune out the magic and tech to just focus on the emotions of the main characters which are the real centerpiece of the story but even that can fall flat in some of the weaker entries. A good and interesting book that probably demands a more thorough and thoughtful examination of its content than I had time to give it. 3.5/5

Overall Bingo Card Score: 3.74/5",1
43,"Has any author you enjoy done the ""last-minute change"" right? (""DeathDragon Anubis"" by Stu Harrington)I posted some art to my SMs earlier this morning of a dragonborn wielding magic, and made a comment about regretting not having given my MC (who is basically a dragonborn, for simplicity) the potential to do the same.

The response was *instantaneous*, and very surprising.

A *lot* of people commented with an echo of ""It's not too late!"" which really took me aback. The series involving the MC in question is 5 books long, and likely going to wrap with a 6th, and I've really become set on the story and path it's going to take, without any large interest to deviate with last-minute changes like this.

I don't intend to make this shift in my story. Raz's tale is writing itself at this point, and magic is not likely a part of his personal arsenal, but after this morning's response to the art in question, I'm *very* curious as to if anyone has suggestions for authors who have made last-minute changes or additions to their MCs/story, and done it well. I've seen it done, but can't think of a single time I've enjoyed the change, but if it's *possible* I would love samples to learn from. It's an odd weapon to add to the writer's arsenal, but I won't say no to anything that might come in useful one day!

ps: marking this as ""spoiler"" preemptively. if/when answering, please remember to follow Rule 2 of the sub.

pps: attaching the art, in case people wanted to see what I meant.

44,"Fantasy Bingo - mini YA book reviewsI've been meaning to do a series of bingo reviews for a while, and kept putting it off because the task seemed so daunting... until I realised that I could just review a subset of the books I've read. I chose to focus on YA, since I think it's a genre that gets a bad rap, when many of the books I've read feature smart, determined and emotionally mature characters, hugely diverse casts, and commentary on a wide range of social and political issues. Some YA is admittedly terrible, but much of it has a lot to say about the world, as well as being fun, easy reading. 

For those interested, my bingo cards to date (including adult books) are [here](https://imgur.com/M9RD9HA) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/LNqwl3E). These reviews include some books that didn't make my bingo card as I've read more books than available squares.

[**The Legacy of Orisha trilogy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34728667-children-of-blood-and-bone) by Toni Adeyemi

*Magic is banned in the west African-inspired land of Orïsha and maji continue to be hunted and killed. Zélie, accompanied by a rogue princess, finds herself on the run from the crown prince and on a mission to bring magic back to the kingdom.* 

Bingo squares: Afrofuturism, ownvoices, published in 2019 (book #2), four word title 

Review: 4/5. I really enjoyed this series, and loved both Zélie and Amari’s POVs - both characters are smart, determined and able to stick up for themselves and what they believe to be right. The book draws a number of parallels to modern day racism and experiences of violence among black people which I think is important in YA fantasy (though I have seen some criticism of her portrayal of Nigerian culture, and am happy to hear more on these points from others). 


[**Six of Crows**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows) by Leigh Bardugo

*Criminal mastermind Kaz Brekker and his team of misfits set off on the heist of a lifetime. Their success is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction—if they don’t kill each other first.* 

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode)

Rating: 5/5. My rating is probably no surprise given the hype around this book, but I love the amount of care that Bardugo affords to all her characters (even when they break your heart), the dialogue is hilarious, and the heist is so intricately plotted that I gasped every time Kaz pulled off another trick.   


[**The Folk of the Air series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince) by Holly Black

*Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King. To win a place at the Court, she must defy him – and face the consequences.*

Bingo squares: Twins (extra hard mode), published in 2019 (books #2-3)

Review: 3/5. This series is hugely popular in YA circles, but I found it to be pretty average. The (big) saving grace is Jude, who is selfish, politically motivated and ruthless, all traits we typically don’t get to see in YA characters, particularly young women. 


[**The Diviners Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7728889-the-diviners) by Libba Bray

*In 1920s New York City, a group of teenagers with mysterious supernatural abilities band together to fight the ghosts that are terrorising the city.*

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode, books #2-3), four word title (books #2-3)

Review: 4/5. There's a lot going on in these books (each instalment could easily be 100 pages shorter), but they're so much fun. Bray captures both the spookiness of the paranormal and the optimism and excess of the roaring 20s perfectly, as well as tackling issues such racism, poverty and workers' rights. The final book will be released in February 2020 for anyone wary of picking up a new series. 


[**House of Salt and Sorrows**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39679076-house-of-salt-and-sorrows) by Erin A Craig 

*A retelling of* Twelve Dancing Princesses*, set in a manor by the sea... only four of the sisters have died in tragic circumstances, and it’s possible their deaths were no accident.* 

Bingo squares: Retelling (hard mode), ocean setting, published in 2019, four word title 

Review: 2/5. This book was incredibly atmospheric, but unfortunately all of the characters (including the MC) were bland as white bread, the villains were lame and the plot was full of convenient deus ex machinas. 


[**Aurora Rising**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40932278-aurora-rising) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff

*Recently graduated from the Aurora Academy, a group of new cadets set out on their first intergalactic mission, only to find themselves in the middle of a brewing civil war.*

Bingo squares: Twins (hard mode), Aussie author, AI character, published in 2019

Review: 5/5. This was honestly just an unapologetically fun space romp and I loved everyone on this ship. 


[**The Illuminae Files**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23395680-illuminae) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff

*Kady and Ezra broke up the same day their planet was invaded. Trapped on an evacuation ship with an enemy fleet bearing down and an AI system that may or may not be out to get them, they’re now forced to work together to save their people and uncover the truth behind the invasion.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, AI character (hard mode)

Rating: 3/5 (noting I’ve only read the first book in the series). The main attraction of this book is the way it’s written - told entirely through documents including emails, chat logs and transcripts - and unfortunately I didn’t think the format was enough to make up for a pretty average plot (if anything, it made it worse, because I felt so disconnected from the main characters). However, if you love unique storytelling formats, you’ll probably love this one. 


[**The Cursebreakers Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43204703-a-curse-so-dark-and-lonely) by Brigid Kemmerer

*A* Beauty and the Beast *retelling where the main character finds herself transported from Washington DC to the kingdom of Emberfell, where the Prince is trapped by a curse that will only be lifted once he finds true love.*

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode), retelling (hard mode), published in 2019, four word title 

Review: 4/5. I was expecting a pretty generic retelling, but the plot quickly goes in a unique direction, led by the main character Harper who quickly makes it her mission not just to save the Prince of Emberfall, but also its people. Harper also has cerebral palsy and I really appreciated the disability rep in this book. 


[**The Lifelike Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29456569-lifel1k3) by Jay Kristoff 

*Set in a post-apocalyptic USA during a robot rebellion, Evie and Lemon find a ruined android in a scrap heap, who helps uncover the truth behind the revolt.* 

Bingo squares: Aussie author, AI character (hard mode), published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 4/5. This series was pitched by the author as “Romeo and Juliet meets Mad Max”, and it’s honestly as ridiculous as it sounds, making it an easy, fun read. 


[**The Lunar Chronicles**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36381037-cinder) by Marissa Meyer

*A sci-fi retelling of four fairytales, starting with the story of Cinder, a cyborg girl in New Beijing who is forced to fend for herself by her awful stepmother, bringing her directly into the path of Prince Kai and setting in motion an intergalactic war.* 

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode), retelling (hard mode), AI character (hard mode)

Review: 4/5. Honestly, these books are just plain fun, particularly as the characters of each retelling get drawn into the broader plot. My only complaint is that balancing the four (all het) couples at the centre of each fairytale can become a drag at times.  


[**The Old Kingdom Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518848.Sabriel) by Garth Nix

*In the Old Kingdom, the Abhorsen helps maintain the border between life and death, righting the wrongs caused by necromancers who interfere with the dead. When Sabriel’s father, the current Abhorsen, goes missing, Sabriel sets out to find him and confront her own destiny. 

Bingo squares: Aussie author 

Review: 4/5. Lots has been said about how good this series is already on this sub, but these books definitely have the most well-thought out and interesting take on necromancy I’ve seen. 


[**Angel Mage**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43655625-angel-mage) by Garth Nix

*A Three Musketeers inspired fantasy set in an analogue of 17th century France, in which angels can be summoned to help with all kinds of tasks and four new friends must team up against a powerful mage with a devastating ability to control the angels for her own ends.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, published in 2019 

Review: 3/5. I loved the world-building and how subtly progressive this book is (there are several female characters in positions of power and lots of PoC living in what is essentially medieval Europe), but was highly disappointed by the abruptness of the ending. Routinely tagged as a YA book (with most of the main characters in their late teens/early 20s), but definitely one that I think is equally aimed at an adult audience. 


[**Whisper**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34020950-whisper) by Lynette Noni

*Following a devastating incident, 'Jane Doe' has been locked away in a secret research facility under Sydney for over two years, without uttering a single word. Once she finally finds her voice, she's exposed to a world of magic which the government has been trying hard to keep a secret.* 

Bingo squares: Aussie author (hard mode), published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 3/5. The main character was lacking in personality and the love triangle was unnecessary (when isn't it?) but the magic system based on the power of words and speech was pretty cool.


[**The Secret Commonwealth**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19034943-the-secret-commonwealth) by Philip Pullman

*Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, are forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed.*

Bingo squares: Published in 2019

Rating: 5/5. I first read *His Dark Materials* at age 11 and fell in love with Lyra Silvertongue, so honestly this rating is gonna be biased and you should just read the series if you haven’t already. 


[**Wayward Son**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44034303-wayward-son) by Rainbow Rowell

*Simon Snow did everything he was supposed to do. He beat the villain. He won the war. He even fell in love. Now comes the good part, right? Now comes the happily ever after…*

Bingo squares: Vampires (hard mode), published in 2019. 

Review: 2/5. I loved *Carry On* and really appreciated all the subtle nods to those of us who grew up obsessed with reading and writing HP fanfiction. However, this book felt like a let down - while I love the premise that being the Chosen One comes with a lot of mental trauma to process afterwards, the actual execution of that idea felt a lot like torture porn, with hour upon hour of watching the characters suffering in silence and failing to communicate.


[**Skyward**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward) by Brandon Sanderson

*The remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot and avenge her father’s reputation.* 

*Bingo squares*: AI character, published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 4/5. You can't really go wrong with Sanderson. Well-plotted (if perhaps a bit formulaic at times), an engaging main character and an interesting take on the idea of living up to the reputation of one's father.


[**Four Dead Queens**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40367270-four-dead-queens) by Astrid Scholte

*Keralie Corrington is one of Quadara’s most cunning thieves, but her latest job finds her entangled in a conspiracy that has left all four of Quadara’s queens for dead, with time running out to solve the mystery.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, published in 2019 (hard mode)

Review: 2/5. The world-building was an absolute mess and I kept being too distracted by it to really enjoy the story. Also features an unfortunate case of ‘bury your gays’, and some of the significant moral and ethical implications of various plot points are never really discussed or explored. 


[**The Guinevere Deception**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43568394-the-guinevere-deception) by Kiersten White

*A retelling of Athurian legend where Guinevere is actually a witch sent to protect Arthur from the dangers lurking in Camelot.*

Bingo squares: Retelling, published in 2019

Review: 3.5/5. The pacing of this book was quite uneven at times but it was a fun and refreshing take on the original legends, and I really appreciated its focus on Guinevere, who is so often either mistreated or ignored in Arthurian stories.",1

Specifically right now I'm thinking about what to get my niece who is 6, but I'll bookmark anything interesting and fantasy related and get it for some little kid someday. 

If anyone's lurking in a similar boat- I really like Munchkin, which is a really simple fantasy card game, and have given it a few times and little folk seem to like it.",1
49,"The Gotrek and Felix novels are really good, above what one would expect from game tie-in novels.I recently finished the 5th Gotrek and Felix novel, *Beastslayer.* I was so impressed. Some caveats: they are somewhat male-centered. There is only one female main character, Ulrika, although she is a bad ass. And occasionally Gotrek and Felix give off a “buddy cop film” vibe. But, I dare say these novels are not superficial in surprising ways and really explore some compelling existentialist themes, such as fighting on in the face of despair, staying true to friends and one’s word, and the complexity and messiness of relationships (romantic and platonic). What do you think of these novels? I also should say that I do not play Warhammer the miniatures game. I came to these novels because they continuously came up in conversations with my fantasy-loving friends. Last comment: the worldbuilding in these novels is so vivid.",1
50,"Terry Pratchett, The Bromeliad.Anyone read this? Any ideas if it fits any of this years bingo squares? It’s been sat on my to read shelf for a couple of years, which is shameful as I have read every book by Terry but not this one for some reason. 

I only have a couple of squares left (Small Scale/Slice of Life, Twins and Afrofuturism I think) but perfectly happy to reorder my selections. Just about to start listening to Greater Boston for Slice of Life, for some reason it’s the square that’s given me the most difficulty in selecting.",1
51,"Does Anyone Else Struggle to Visualize?So, I really struggle to visualize things when reading a book. I don't have Aphantasia, I can get a pretty decent image in my head, but it's usually wonky and not how I want it to look. I particularly struggle with human proportions and faces and the size of things in general. When I try to visualize a character they usually end up as an extreme version of how they're described (i.e. if someone is described as being thin then I imagine them with incredibly unrealistic proportions to the point where they almost look as thin as a stick figure). It's really annoying and it's almost like fighting a battle with my own head because people never turn out how I want them to look. Does anyone else struggle with this? Does anyone know how to get better at imagining exactly what you think it should look like?",1
52,"My finished bingo card - mostly magic, and some other stuffI'm done with my first bingo card ever! I enjoyed filling out the spaces on my card, and to celebrate, I'm posting short musings and some stats. 

* Average score: 3.75 (not bad!)
* Female to male authors: 17:10
* Self-published works that stayed that way: 2
* Stand-alone books: 8
* The prevailing theme - magic, featured in 16 books

SLICE OF LIFE: **Stevermer, Caroline -** [**A Scholar of Magics**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1041257.A_Scholar_of_Magics?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=zondajoNHP&amp;rank=1) 

*  In the second installment of the series A College of Magics, we visit yet another magic school, this time for men only, in England. Everything is very proper and cerebral, right before it goes into silly direction of a notorious conspiracy. *(4/5)*  
  

CHARACTER WITH DISABILTY: **Josiah Bancroft -** [**Arm of the Sphinx**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959733-arm-of-the-sphinx?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=5NXUT27H99&amp;rank=1)

* After losing one's wife, naivete, and self-absorption, Senlin found himself a crew, and hallucinations. How are they to find Marya and navigate the Tower, where factions prepare for battle?   
 Since Gormenghast I wasn't so enamored in a fictional place. The characters are no less interesting, with more of them coming to the forefront. Multiple POVs are handled quite well, as well as multiple plot-threads. *(5/5)*

SFF NOVELA: **Kelly Robson -** [**Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36187158-gods-monsters-and-the-lucky-peach?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=pjd1AJ1Sy4&amp;rank=1)

* The world became unlivable as climate changed (are you scared yet?). However, there are is a push for ecological restoration - and one of the ways to do that is time-travel. Of course, meeting the locals is not without its problems...   
 This book doesn't pull its punches, and it ain't pretty. You are bombarded with techno-babble, trying to make sense of the world's history and who's who, and when you finally grasp it, you get punched in the gut. It's a miracle how many emotions a work under 200 pages can invoke. I'm mostly angry, though. The characters behave so human it's almost painful*. (4/5)*

SELF-PUBLISHED SSF: **Patrick, Benedict -** [**Those Brave, Foolish Souls from the City of Swords**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35895961-those-brave-foolish-souls-from-the-city-of-swords?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=mLheSxplr0&amp;rank=1)

* Benedict Patrick continues to tick my boxes for enjoyable, meaningful stories filled with characters I care about. Here, we see echoes of America's fables, and get to meet some parallel-universe version of Pocahontas.   
 We follow 3 POVs and - I'm not gonna lie - together with the stories between chapters, it sometimes felt like a chore. I feel that characters' stories (especially Yizel's), as result, rang a bit hollow, their motivations not that clear, their emotions a bit harder to experience.  *(4/5)*

SFF TWINS: **Seth Dickinson -** [**The Traitor Baru Cormorant**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=LvRyu8JGSO&amp;rank=1) 

* Her home colonized, Baru is set on gaining enough power to turn tables on the conquerors. Alas, doing so will test her beyond endurance, as she is to be used as a weapon herself.  
 Baru is a compelling, if unlikable, character. She has to make hard decisions. The impact was somewhat dulled because the abundance of characters made it almost impossible to get to know them enough to care for them*. (3.5/5)*

VAMPIRES: **Frohock, T. -** [**Los Nefilim**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26029556-los-nefilim?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=JZylKoV1Oj&amp;rank=1)

* Nefilim are children of humans and angels, or human and demons, or both. Their magic rises from the use of music, and concerning their parentage, they have some unique abilities. Diago is both demonic and angelic in nature, which makes him a pawn in angelic and demonic power struggles. The characters are vivid and likable, the plot tight and unforgiving*,* and the magic system interesting.  *(4/5)*  

GRAPHIC NOVEL: **Marjorie M.Liu, Sana Takeda - Monstress Vol.3:Haven** 

* The art is still great and the stakes ever higher. What *is* it with the parasitical monster? I am still a bit lost in many threads and factions (I can't be bothered to write it down), but enjoying the ride. *(4/5)*

OCEAN SETTING: **McKillip, Patricia A. -** [**The Changeling Sea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59.The_Changeling_Sea?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=g8sfPU5AYx&amp;rank=1)

* Peri's father has perished on the sea, and her mother sits by the window, depressed and bewitched by the sea. Peri hexes the sea, and out comes the sea-dragon, and the magic, and the restless prince.   
 This book feels warm, and familiar. The characters are well rounded and kind, the magic fickle and strange, and the atmosphere hopeful. I enjoyed Peri's friends at the inn, the romance, and the conclusion to the story*. (5/5)*

CYBERPUNK: **Melissa Scott -** [**Trouble and Her Friends**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/612226.Trouble_and_Her_Friends?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=beWWUBZoeJ&amp;rank=1)

* The crackers' time is at an end - the Law has come to the Net, and Trouble skips town and her lover. But one does not leave that easily, and three years later Treasury is on her back, there is an impostor that took her name, and there is nothing she can do but to go back.   
 This was a refreshing take on cyberpunk tropes - if still a bit dry, and full of technobabble I abhor. The characterization was good, the world-building solid, and I came to care what happens to Trouble (and her friends, naturally). On the other hand, the plot dragged in the middle, and some interesting plot moments were picked up and immediately dropped (I'd like to know more about secretary schools, thank you very much). *(2.5/5)*

2ND CHANCE: **Aliette de Bodard -** [**The Tea Master and the Detective** ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36686547-the-tea-master-and-the-detective?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=gZQ0HPUcyO&amp;rank=1)

* Sherlock in space? Not really, but nevertheless it was an engaging read I almost completely forgot in a week. *(3 /5)*

AFROFUTURISM: **Nnedi Okorafor -** [**Binti**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25667918-binti?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=WIgpFtVJ5F&amp;rank=1) 

* Binti is leaving her home world to start new education, but in the middle of their flight everyone but her is murdered. She is alone, left to parley and negotiate with the murderers.   
 This is a short, atmospheric work that happens mostly inside Binti's head. The conflict is convincing and the problem solving quite unique, if a bit dry. *(3.5/5)*

PUBLISHED 2019: **Arden, Katherine -** [**The Winter of the Witch**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36621586-the-winter-of-the-witch?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=lDZDxm8qVE&amp;rank=1) 

* The ending of a trilogy that made me feel, wonder, and sigh. Vasya is all grown up and eager to make her own name in a world that is struggling to decide between two religions, and two masters... The war is brewing in Rus.   
 This story is very satisfying in its approach to characterization, setting, and imagining of historical events. This is probably the first time I enjoyed Slavic folklore from the pen of a contemporary ""Western"" author. I enjoyed the book, although it lacked a certain \*something\* to be a stellar read. *(4/5)*

LOCAL: **Dubravka Ugrešić -** [**Baba Jaga je snijela jaje**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6437644-baba-jaga-je-snijela-jaje?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=rqdJdEl9oc&amp;rank=1) **(Baba Yaga Laid an Egg)**

* A curious triptich loosely based on Baba Jaga concept(s). For the most part, this book read like a pantomime in my mind - it was nonsensical, and witty. The fear of the old age is present in most of the narrative, intertwined with hope and joie de vivre. Some of the elements didn't work for me, and the satire took of some of the enjoyment from it. The characters really felt like dolls (maybe it's intentional, but I didn't care for it either way), and imagery was in-your-face. *(2.5/5)*

MIDDLE GRADE: **Cooper, Susan -** [**Over Sea, Under Stone**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11312.Over_Sea_Under_Stone?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=23kdja62Af&amp;rank=1) 

* The Drew children find a map, and with small help fromtheir eccentric uncle start looking for Arthurian treasure, trying to stay ahead of curious enemies.   
 This book was cozy and familiar, but forgettable and boring. *(2/5)*

PERSONAL RECCOMENDATION [R/FANTASY](/r/FANTASY): **Sarah Gailey -** [**Magic for Liars**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34594037-magic-for-liars?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=CayIDn1JQB&amp;rank=1)

* Ivy Gamble is hired to solve a murder (or is it?) case in a magic school, where she is forced to come to terms with her estranged twin dister and her own sense of failure.   
 This is a tight-paced, character-based book, where you guess the killer almost immediately and are mad at inept PI who is struggling with her own shit. *(3/5)*

BOOK OF THE MONTH/READALONG: **Marina and Sergey Dyachenko -** [**Vita Nostra**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=XVtH4AFpHd&amp;rank=1)

* Sasha is forced to study incomprehensible things - things that change her very essence.   
 This read like a study in metaphysics, an uncomfortable and often violent coming-of-age story. The book was almost impossible to put down, and will stay with me for a long time. *(5/5)*

MEDIA TIE-IN: **Brandon Sanderson -** [**Children of the Nameless**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43205859-children-of-the-nameless?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=d0LKMyxInR&amp;rank=1)

*  Innistrad is a land where one tries to live while demons and monsters populate the forests, and mystical Entities influence the land and one's people. When a village is wiped out, a cursed girl wants to get her vengeance on powerful Man of the Manor.   
 I've played Magic ages ago, but the knowledge about it wasn't needed - Sanderson is really a master of world-building. The world is indeed interesting, both bleak and hopeful. Tropes are abundant and the twist quite unsurprising, but this was a nice, cozy book around 200 pages. I found the characterization to be weak - I never really remember or care about Sanderson's characters, really. *(3/5)*

AI CHARACTER: **C. Robert Cargill -** [**Sea of Rust**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32617610-sea-of-rust?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=dO0UgDFsDD&amp;rank=1)

*  AI uprising is finished, leaving the world bereft of humans and animals alike. And of hope, it seems, because it's every bot for itself.   
 I enjoyed the action scenes here, it really read more like a movie. It was really cool and something my teenage students would enjoy. Alas, the characterization was not on par, and it felt emotionally stunted - and not in an ""AI"" way. Still, I enjoyed the imagery and it was refreshing to read an AI's dystopia, so I'm rounding it up to *(4/5)*

4 OR MORE WORDS: **Diana Wynne Jones -** [**Dark Lord of Derkholm**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47587.Dark_Lord_of_Derkholm?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=zGMU0QqXMf&amp;rank=1)

*  How does one go around and becomes a Dark Lord when one is expected to do so to be a tourist attraction? That is the situation wizard Derk finds himself in, together with his numerous household that includes his human and griffin children, as well as various wondrous Animals (who doesn't like flying pigs or carnivorous sheep?).   
 I enjoyed this satire: while humorous, it didn't shy away from more serious themes of dehumanization, cruelty, manipulation, or serious consequences. The book sagged a bit in the middle, though, and some of the themes were not as thoroughly discussed as I'd have liked. *(4/5)*

RETELLING: **Drew Heyes -** [**Second Hand Curses**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36315727-second-hand-curses?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=5B5F0Cf1C5&amp;rank=1) 

* A band of likeable and not-as-they-seem rascals romps through (some kind of) fairyland, solving problems for gold. We get to revisit some old-time favorites with a morbid twist (Cinderella, Pinocchio, Pied Piper of Hamelin, etc.), and see how our rascals chase afteir their salvation...  
 This book was so fun! Certainly, it could use an editor to weed out a chunk of text, and some more characterization... but it is entertaining, has some good action scenes, and ruins your childhood. What's not to like? *(4/5)*

AUSTRALIAN: **O'Malley, Daniel -** [**The Rook**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836728-the-rook?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=hPryvRyHaB&amp;rank=1)

* A woman comes to her senses in the rain, in the midst of dead bodies. What next?   
 This book was a struggle to get into, to be honest. It also has a weird case of man-gaze. It started strong, and then dragged about 100 pages, with much info dumps, and little in the way of plot.  When it gained momentum it was a fun ride to the end. A secret government organization that deals with supernatural phenomenon was never so witty! *(3.5/5)*

FINAL BOOK IN A SERIES: **Ian Tregillis -** [**Necessary Evil**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793041-necessary-evil?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=aZ6TYAhDNq&amp;rank=4)

* **Milkweed Triptych** became one of my favorite series. This unique blend of plotting, characterization, and alternate history with German Übermensch and British Elder wizards has my favorite villain of all time – precog Gretel. The final installment bring everything to an end in a mostly satisfying manner, even if the MC was my least favorite character, fuckin' Marsh. (*5/5* for the series, *4/5* for this book)

\#OWNVOICES: **N.K.Jemisin -** [**Broken Earth trilogy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=ASEaLMGpj3&amp;rank=1)

* One of the most disappointing series – came highly recommended, started strong, and then lost my interest with constant repetition of themes, meandering, and over-the-top, and shove-it-in-your-face explanations. A shame. *(3.5/5)* 

LitRPG: **Andrew Rowe -** [**Sufficiently Advanced Magic**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403860-sufficiently-advanced-magic?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=2hCwbQdJ2E&amp;rank=1)

*  In a world where peace hangs in precarious balance, there be towers in which a Godess grants powers (or attunements) in exchange for solving the tower's mysteries and slaying its monsters. It is a thing of prestige, but Corin just wants his brother back. The book has a magic school (yay!), solid and game-like magic system (all the info-dumps one could possibly want!), a protagonist that is all about alliances (no social skills but no excuses!), and hints about a broader world. Sure, there could be less exposition, the world-building could be better, the characters more fleshed out, and the sense of danger more prominent, but this has been a really fun ride, and the ending packed a great twist. *(4/5)*

FIVE SHORT STORIES: **Nalo Hopkinson -** [**Falling In Love With Hominids**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23846151-falling-in-love-with-hominids?from_search=true&amp;qid=QzNpkGTtv3&amp;rank=7)

*  This anthology contains stories with short introductions from the author, and all of them are a part of the process in which the author ""fell in love with humans"" of whom she despaired in her youth. It is a curious and intriguing mix of fables and concepts mostly set in our world, some in our time, some in future. There is horror, there are emotions, there is weirdness, and there is wonder. Important topics are introduced and explored, as well as that interpersonal traumas. Some of the stories worked better than others. *(4/5)*",1

54,"I need some new (by which I mean recently emerged) favorite authors.Just realized that all of my favorite authors are either writers of decades-long standing... or dead. I dont think I've added a new author to my favorites list for at least a decade. I don't have a bookstore nearby to browse in and my little local library has a small fantasy section, so I buy books online mostly. I would really love some suggestions for new authors to check out. Looking for 

1. Authors who debuted in the last decade-ish 

2. Write books that are not epics. Please.

3. No excessive gore, sex, language (some of all is fine)

4. Authors who have at least a handful of books I can read.

I'm not fond of first person perspective and most but not all of my favorite authors are women. (My bookshelf has Mercedes Lackey, Robin McKinley, Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, Jane Yolen, Patricia C Wrede, Robert Jordan, Tolkien, Asimov, Patricia McKillip,  Terry Pratchett, for reference.)

56,"Seeking Ideas and Recommendations for an Audiodrama-only r/fantasy Bingo CardInspired by u/tctippens’ recommendations for Bingo, and u/briargrey’s reviews, I’m working on an all-audiodrama bingo card. (Thank you both for making me think this was possible!) I've got most of it sorted, but I’m struggling to figure out a few squares, and hoping people here have some ideas. 

I'm looking for recommendations, and in some cases ideas for how to interpret the square, for:

**LitRPG**: Are there any litRPG audio dramas? If not, I might try an actual play podcast, since it seems close to the spirit of the square -- any recommendations for someone who has never listened to one and isn’t sure if they’ll like it?

**Retelling**

**Anthology/short stories**: Hoping to find an audio drama option, not just narrated short stories.

**Graphic Novel/Audiobook**: Currently just using this as an “over 25 hours” square, but if anyone has ideas more aligned with the format switch of the square, I’ll take them!

**Self-published**: What would the equivalent be for podcasts? Any specific ones you'd recommend?

(**Book Club/Readalong**: I’ll probably swap this for a “reviewed on r/fantasy” category, since I don’t think this has ever happened.)

**Personal Recommendation**: **Let me know your favorite audiodramas that I should try**! I'm relatively new to these, so there's lots I haven't listened to, particularly outside of the really commonly mentioned ones like Nightvale, Bright Sessions, and We're Alive. I’ll try most things, though I tend to stay away from horror (mildly creepy is fine). Some of my favorites have been Love and Luck, Wolf 359, Steal the Stars, and the second season of Kalila Stormfire (the first season was good, but not quite my thing--I think maybe I prefer larger casts of characters to follow). I usually prefer stories that are optimistic or hopeful, even if their world is dark, and likable main characters are a big plus. Open to any length or genre, completed stories or not. Also, it seems less common in audiodramas than books, but I'd appreciate a heads up if you know that a show has onscreen sexual or domestic violence—it doesn’t mean I won’t listen to it, just that I’ll select when I listen more carefully (e.g. maybe not when I want to decompress from a stressful day at work...).

59,"[SPOILERS] Just Finished A Land Fit for Heroes (The Steel Remains, The Cold Commands, The Dark Defiles) by Richard K MorganI've had my eye on this series for a long time (since i read First Law 10 years ago).   Finally picked up all 3 books.   I found it pretty ... alright.

I think it checks off a lot of boxes.   I like the grim darkness and violence of it.  The High Tech vs High Magic aspects.

The last book was such a slog.   Just wanted to get it over with.   I liked the trilogy, but i don't think i would have regretted not reading it at all.

At least it taught me a little of what i DON'T like:

* same bad guy(s)/threat level  the entire trilogy.   i know some series get criticized cause of the way they exponentially ramp up the bad guys through the series like Dragonball.    but thats better than having the same enemy that we see defeated over and over again.
* The hero just keeps whipping their ass at the end of each book.  And each time the hero does it with the intervention of ...  literal Deus Ex.  Like in-universe Gods. Every time.
* i like description and details, but this book's overly descriptive passages about the angle of a credenza...or whatever ... i kept just skimming over them, and did that thing where i felt guilty about skimming over text, and going back to read the passages, and then wishing i skipped them
* the magic in the world is ... so convenient.   Every time the hero gets into a bind.  theres a convenient spell that he pulls out of thin air that seems to be tailor made for the situation.   and then we read a flashback of him learning that spell.
* also i counted at least 6 x where the hero gets captured, or defeated or bushwacked, and then is tied up and surrounded and outnumbered.   and the bad guy explains the entire plan, and then turns their back on the hero.  and then of course the hero inevitably gets the upper hand or gets saved by a deus ex.   2x in the last 100 pages.
* off page death for a main character!   like end a cliffhanger on one chapter where one of the main heroes is in a situation where, surely he must be dead, but lets find out how he gets out of it!!!,  then 3 chapters later,   ""he ded""
* set up interesting dynamic between old and new religions, but didnt seem to explore it much.
* set up interesting world history /mysteries and didnt really explore it much

&amp;#x200B;

what i did like:

* kiriath Steel
* the muhn/band
* near the last 50 pages or so when the hero is recaptured again and the bad guy is gloating  ""your story is almost at an end, can you feel how thin the pages left are?""   very meta
* i also like the ... internal monologue type parts (in italic).  They seem to happen in ""real time"" and other characters will catch the main pov characters ""zoning out""
* i think cthulhu makes a cameo.

&amp;#x200B;

i think i like my magic at a minimum, less convenient.",1
60,"Looking to decompress, help by recommending some laidback romance booksAfter reading a few stressful high intrigue books I want to just unwind a bit a read a story where the main character meets someone special, maybe they have a few adventures together, and they live happily ever after.   The more slice-of-life, the better.

A few of my favorite books that scratched this particular itch were The Sharing Knife (one of my favorite series period), Uprooted, The Healer's Road, and Ravenwood (not so much the sequels though).

61,"Review of Lovecraft Country - 3/5Just finished this last night and ended up writing a rare review.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This was really hard to rate. 3 or 4 stars? I kept changing my mind. Eventually I decided - helped along by reading other reviews - that I only wanted to give it 4 stars because I really like the concept, because I want to see more of this kind of thing, and because the beginning of the book was great and stuck the most in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, the book slightly disappointed me, given its acclaim. It IS a good book, but it has very little Lovecraft connection beyond the first story (&gt;!ghosts and killer dolls and rather garden variety wizardry!&lt; are not really Lovecraftian), it's rhythm and flow is all over the place, and it is pretty thinly drawn both in terms of detail, characters, and often prose (but that might just be my own personal preference).

&amp;#x200B;

Finding out the book is more like a collection of connected short stories (none of which conclude in their part, and all have to wait for the bull rush of an ending at the final end of the book) was my biggest gripe, especially after such an excellent, engaging and atmospheric setup in the first and longest (and by far most Lovecraftian) story and me wondering where it was gonna lead to. Then each story gets a little more disappointing and disconnected and you realise it's more like you're reading loosely tied together vignettes, without a particularly engaging overarching plot. It feels very front loaded.

&amp;#x200B;

The end felt like the author had gotten a bit bored of it all and just wanted to hurry up and finish it. What I kept (with exciting foreboding) expecting to happen in regards to the wider plot and its possible terrible revelations never actually happened, and it turned out there was very little to the plot after all. Maybe the author wanted it all quickly tied up and was more concerned with the side-themes than the plot or its lasting impact on the characters. That's not Lovecraftian - but then neither is this book.

&amp;#x200B;

The book is still a good book, and people will (and do) obviously rate it a lot higher, and that's totally fair. In my opinion it succeeds most when it is dealing with Jim Crow America, when it is ""on the move"" (as in the first story), and anything to do with the Safe Negro Travel Guide or Ardham. All of that was great. It succeeds least when it is trying to be scary after the first story, when it is simply throwing things at the wall to see what sticks (and not giving things time to land and their impact digested), when it gets really light and pulpy, when it is comes to making a really compelling overall narrative, and when it is forgetting to engage in deeper characterisation or meaningful consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps most jarring of all is how all the characters take the existence of &gt;!magic, monsters, ghosts, other worlds!&lt; etc. completely in their stride, like it was all barely above the mundane. Certainly don't expect any ""driven to madness"" that's such a central theme to Lovecraftian works. In fact don't expect much more than a raised eyebrow.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a good, pulpy read, but unfortunately I was hoping for a lot more than that given the hype and acclaim. I was also hoping for a deep and engaging Lovecraftian deconstruction - but after the first story he was more of just a mild reference than anything, and I think the great title of the book looked in hindsight like a little bit of a selling gimmick.",1

65,"Sorcerer's Legacy - a quick reviewJust finished this book for the first time last night, and it was a really engrossing read. The plot grabs you right from the start and the pace is refreshingly fast and relentless. I was a bit worried seeing as how one of the primary subgenres is romance, as honestly romance typically isn't my thing and often struggles to hold my attention, but the gripping court and political intrigue took center stage, the romance when it did show up I felt was really well done, and there's quite a fair bit of action as well - more than I was suspecting, which really surprised me but in a good way!

In short, it was a wonderful read. If I had any complaints, it would be that everything seems to wrap up a bit too quickly and neatly at the end, and there didn't really feel like there was much in the way of traditional denouement, but other than that it was a really good, gripping, and enjoyable read, and an excellent debut by Janny Wurts.",1

67,"Relation between Morrowind and MistbornI played Morrowind a few years ago from the Elder Scrolls series, and I started reading Mistborn the other day. I couldn't help but notice a lot of similarities between the two universes and I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this. Some of the similarities I found were:
-Whole country covered in ash after disaster from years ago caused by a living god defeating a mysterious  enemy.
-Red sky and sun after said disaster.
-Society divided into great houses that dominate society. Granted, there are more noble houses in Mistborn than there are in Morrowind, but the dynamic is similar.
-Said houses have large buildings in capital city. Keeps in Luthadel and cantons in Vivec city.
-Rulership by great houses controlled by theocracy led by a living deity. Vivec in Morrowind, Lord ruler in Mistborn.
-Society relies heavily on near slavery and is racist towards said slaves. The skaa in Mistborn and the argonians in Morrowind.
-Plantations worked by slaves in the rural areas of the country.
-Plants have all turned an ugly colour.
-Skaa sounds like Skaal even though the have nothing to do with each other

Those are some of the similarities I found, don't know how many people on this sub have played/read both series. Looking forward to any answers!",1
68,"When Cage Matches Replace Lawyers and Wars: A Review of The Combat Codes by Alexander DarwinStarting off I have a few disclaimers. First and foremost, this is my first review so please bear with me if it sucks. Second, I did win a giveaway in order to receive the audiobook for free. I had actually bought the e-book before and had decided to buy the audiobook once my credits reset on audible, so I declined the free book.

My thoughts:

I loved reading the book, and can't wait for the sequel here in a few months! I read it in about two days, while visiting the in-laws. The book is written by a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner and instructor, thus the fights are realistic. That was the draw for me to read the book, and it delivered! All of the fights were satisfying in one way or another. it was a great time. The story is a pretty solid story, but I don't want to talk much on my thoughts as I don't trust myself to not spoil anything. I just truly had a great great time, and still a few weeks later find myself thinking on things from the book.

Synopsis by me: This is a book about fighting. The book is set in the future, where war got so bad that collectively everyone decided to settle all disputes in one-on-one unarmed combat matches. The fighters, called Grievars, follow a set of codes, the titular Combat Codes. A young boy, Cego, is fighting in the underground, and is discovered by a retired Grievar, Murray, who is now a talent scout. Murray fights to free Cego and bring him to the institute to train. The rest of the book follows the events unfolding there.

The world is quite futuristic. I found it to be a neat mix of the worlds of Hunger Games, Red Rising, and Into the Badlands. I wouldn't call it a YA book by any means, but it did have a somewhat YA feel, likely due to the similar vibes I was getting to the books/show mentioned previously. It was close enough to our technology to be a believable future for the world, but not so close that it felt strange to read about. The feel of the world is usually one of the first things to break a book for me, so the fact that I like the world, and I am interested in exploring it some is a great feeling. I enjoy the concept of not fighting with technology and guns even though it is an option, and settling things with a brutal unarmed fight instead. That is part of the charm of kung-fu films. 

The prose is somewhat simple, which in my opinion really helped pull me into the story. It is told from the perspective of some fighters, not intellectuals. As such, it feels like you experience the world as they do. They think differently than I do as a numbers guy, and as such the book feels more whole to me. A thread was posted a while back about not giving easy to read books enough credit. I feel like this falls into that category, it is easy to read, but it is strength not a flaw.

In fantasy, often fights go on for what feels like forever, or they just do outrageous things that would never work in real life. This is something that any lover of fights will notice, and sometimes it is enough to make you want to put down the book. I noticed at times the fights in this book relied on terminology that I wasn't very familiar with, or just felt too technical, but it never felt unrealistic. I still loved pretty much every minute of every fight. My goodness it is satisfying to read a good fight, and imagine it happening. The fights as they played out in my head were spectacular! Part of that is my imagination running wild, part of that is just having a well written fight.

Every book has its flaws. This is the first book written by Darwin, writing about one of his favorite things (BJJ). As such I expect some flaws to creep in and be overlooked for one reason or another. However, no flaw I noticed was so big, or so bad that it pulled me out of reading. None of them will keep me from buying the sequel, and I can only expect that Darwin will get better as he writes more, and if he doesn't I am still more than happy and satisfied with what he will produce based off this book.

My biggest gripe about the book is really that it made me miss my time practicing martial arts. I just don't have the options that I really want where I live anymore (too small of a place), and likely won't anytime too soon. I guess I'll just have to live vicariously through the sequel!

TLDR; I loved this book. It has its flaws as all books do, but with this being a debut novel, I am beyond pleased. If you like good fights, or UFC, this book is definitely for you. It is an easy read, and fairly quick, with a sequel on the way soon. You won't regret the read!

78,"Dreadnought by April Daniels - Trans Supergirl fantasy story 4.5/5http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1459-dreadnought

4.5/5

DREADNOUGHT is the first novel of the Nemesis series. The premise is Danny Tozer, young transgender girl, is there when Dreadnought the world's greatest superhero is killed. Danny inherits the power of Dreadnought but also becomes her idealized self (effectively Supergirl). This is problematic since Danny is still hiding her trans identity from her transphobic parents as well as schoolmates. She is, after all, only fifteen. But there's more to her life than dealing with them. There's an entire army of evil she needs to defeat as the other superheroes have nothing on Dreadnought--and the world needs a Dreadnought.

I really liked this book and have to say that April Daniels did an excellent story of superheroics and a Spiderman ""coming of age"" origin while also telling a tale of a trans teen coming to terms with their new identity. Danielle is completely aware of who she is and what gender she is meant to be but is hiding it from her father.
Danny wants to be a hero, at least a little, but is mostly happy that she's been blessed with teenage supermodel looks that reflect how she wish she had been born. Danielle doesn't jump into superheroism automatically but deals with a lot of conflicting emotions regarding the process. The older superheroes of the setting are clear that it is a demanding and sometimes traumatizing life.

There are some people who will ask whether this is more a transgender awakening book or a superhero book. It's definitely both and the two don't conflict too much. There's perhaps a bit too much time spent on the father (who is, sadly, a one-dimensional piece of crap--but that's just how some parents are) but it is about Danny coming to terms with fact they don't have to be afraid anymore. They are the most powerful girl in the world and that liberation is a universal escapist fantasy that I think will appeal to all readers.

I like the supporting cast and appreciate virtually every character except Danny's family. Graywytch is an ugly bigot but is at least interesting in her reasoning (it offends her witchcraft-based religion), Valkyrja is very entertaining in her attempts to be supportive to Danny, and Doctor Impossible (no, not the one from Soon I will be Invincible) is highly entertaining. I think I loved the character of Calamity, a black teenage cowgirl vigilante, the most.

If I had one complaint, it is the fact that Danny does have to deal with such ugly and vile transphobia throughout the book. It's not that it isn't important for the book but that it is an unfortunate thing that makes the book uncomfortable. That it is something we have to deal with in the real world so often and that it must sadly also be confronted in our escapism. So a warning on the content as it doesn't shy away from the slurs thrown at many transteens in RL.

The highlight of the book for me was the easy friendship between Calamity and Danny. I don't know if Danny and Calamity are going to have a romance (Danny being a gay woman) but I think they'd make a cute couple if they were. I also appreciate how Danny, who is going to inherit the ""whitecape"" (noble paladin type) of Dreadnought, has ended up befriending a ""graycape"" (vigilante) as their friend as well as mentor.

So, did I like it? Oh yes. I picked up the sequel immediately. I should note that April Daniels is also writing from her own experiences with Danny's trans experience and this is something that made me more interested in checking out the book. This doesn't break the mold of superhero literature but that isn't necessary for someone who is looking for something that homages all the classic tropes as well as tells a deeply personal growing up story.",1
79,"Most severely underlooked fantasy sagas to have come out within these last few years?For me it's easily the Aldorean Chronicles by Michael Wisehart (it feels even more like a love letter to Wheel of Time than Licanius) and the Sunsurge Quartet by David Hair.

Are there any books/series like this? And if so, why not? Do you think it's hard to write interesting magic based fantasy in a non-medieval world? 

I know there's series like Dresden Files and such but I'm not talking about urban fantasy that mostly takes place in real earth type locations but rather very traditional fantasy in fantasy worlds BUT with diesel/atomicpunk level of technology if not much higher technologies.",1
81,"Why are there little to no fantasy series where the bad guys win?I feel like there are plenty of examples outside of fantasy or outside of the medium (movies, tv series, etc.) but I have yet to encounter a story that ends with total victory for evil/the antagonists. Why is that? Is it simply due to the desire of the author to meet the expectations of the audience? Or does it defy the foundations of fantasy itself? Do you think it is possible to do this successfully?

Edit: I should clarify that I'm looking at epic fantasy specifically. I know there are plenty of examples in sci fi or just current day fiction.

Edit edit: There have been a lot of great recommendations that I will check out, thank you for that. But as far as epic fantasy, there are only a handful among a mountain of titles. The Hero's Journey is fairly centric to epic fantasy and the hero losing in the end might feel cheap or incomplete. I think I've come to the unstable conclusion that in order for the story to not come off as cheap, it has to try to accomplish some other goal in its writing. Maybe say something about the human condition. And in doing that, it needs to break from the hero's journey and ceases to be epic fantasy.

**Slice-of-Life/Small-Scale Fantasy (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison

*Description*: After his father and brothers are murdered, the kindhearted son of an emperor must come out of exile to take up his father's throne.

*Review*: This book lived up to its reputation. It's such a tender, humane piece of writing, populated by complex and relatable characters. If it has a major flaw, it's that the storyline which is billed as the main plot goes nowhere. Oh, all the threads are resolved, but with no particular aplomb. But this isn't a book you read for the plot; you read it for the characters and gentle atmosphere. 

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Gray House by Mariam Petrosyan

*Description*: Various teenagers attempt to make sense of their relationships and identities in the context of a boarding school for disabled children--a school that happens to be both alive and rather possessive. 

*Review*: Where do I even start? *The Gray House* is meandering, full of long, grotesque descriptions and unlikable characters, and has no real plot. Moreover, all of these things are true for the entirety of its 721 pages. But it's also *so good*. It creates a world which is absolutely complete unto itself, full of characters with complex psychology and stark, vivid imagery. I can't adequately describe it in a paragraph, but if you enjoy slow, literary fiction at all, it's worth checking out.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**SFF Novella**

*Book*: The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion by Margaret Killjoy

*Description*: A punk-rock anarchist with a bad case of wanderlust stumbles upon a community of like-minded folk, only to discover that its residents are being slaughtered by a dangerous spirit.

*Review*: I wanted to like this book. It had a lot that intrigued me: it's very queer, it's told from a political perspective I've had little exposure to, and it's about a subculture that I've never seen represented in such a positive light. It also has an awesome title. But unfortunately I found that it suffers from rushed pacing and cast that's too large to really connect with in the context of a novella. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it had been a novel, with more time to really flesh out the setting and the characters.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**Self-Published SFF Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: With Strings Attached, or The Big Pink Job by D. Aviva Rothschild

*Description*: \*cough\* Oh lord. In 1980, the four former members of the Beatles--yes, those Beatles--are sent to an alien universe by a group of extra-dimensional undergraduate psychology students and forced to hunt down a big pink statue in exchange for a ticket home.

*Review*: This is way better than it has any right to be. It's also about as un-creepy as a fantasy novel about four real people could be (i.e., no shipping). I read the part that's free online out of morbid curiosity, and then suddenly found myself buying the e-book. It's got complex characterization, original worldbuilding, and some weird, weird shit. There's a bit where John Lennon impersonates an alternate universe version of himself in order to spearhead a civil rights movement for anthropomorphic rabbits. It'd probably benefit from a good editor--it's bulky--but I was never too bothered. Believe me, I had reservations, but it's actually pretty good.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring Twins (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Black Tides of Heaven by J. Y. Yang

*Description*: The twin children of a monarch struggle to maintain their bond in the midst of political upheaval. 

*Review*: Like *The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion*, I think this book tried to do too much in too little time. Yang does some incredible worldbuilding, and presents very interesting ideas for characters and a story, but somehow the disparate pieces never quite coalesced into a compelling whole. I may still check out the other books in this series, though, so it did something right.

*Rating*: 2.5/5.

**Novel Featuring Vampires (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Carry On by Rainbow Rowell

*Description*: Caught up in his people's war to preserve their magic, the Chosen One falls in love with his archenemy as he struggles to cope with the knowledge that he probably won't live to see adulthood. A take-off on *Harry Potter*.

*Review*: A solid YA romance layered over with some genuinely clever worldbuilding, a fun plot, and well-drawn characters. I'm not usually a ""magic system"" kind of person, but I found this one, in which magic words are discovered among the idioms and memes in common use among non-magical people, to be fun to explore and think about.

*Rating*: 3.5/5.

**Graphic Novel**

*Book*: White Sand, Vol. 2, written by Brandon Sanderson and illustrated by Julius M. Gopez

*Description*: The runt of a clan of sand wizards must seek support and avoid assassination after unexpectedly becoming the leader of his people.

*Review*: I did not find this to be Sanderson's best work. There's nothing exactly wrong with it, but there's nothing really right with it either. There's not much clever Sanderson-y plotting and all the characters fit into more-or-less standard archetypes. It has fun moments, and I will dutifully read volume three, but this was not inspiring.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**SFF Novel by an Author Local to You**

*Book*: Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix

*Description*: An unmotivated employee of an Ikea knock-off must pull a night shift in order to investigate strange goings-on in the store. A ghost story. 

*Review*: This book finds its premise in the ""scripted disorientation"" deliberately created by the architects of big box stores and the economic desperation of many of the people working in them. It has tight pacing, gory thrills, and a few moments of surprisingly poignant commentary on what it's like to be working class in postindustrial America. It's predictable, yes, but also essentially well-crafted. If you a.) like ghost stories and b.) have ever worked retail, this is a fun, quick read.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting**

*Book*: The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

*Description*: A queen, a priestess, and a would-be dragon rider must navigate their deep-rooted ideological differences in order to save the world from an ancient evil.

*Review*: This is another one I really wanted to like. It accomplishes a lot, but not in comparison with its ambition. The prose is pretty, even veering into beautiful at times. The dragons are as awesome as dragons should be. But the pacing is uneven, first very slow and then rushed at the end, and the plot itself is pure fantasy cliché. Somehow it suffers both from a lack of space and a lack of ideas. It was the kind of book I liked as I was reading it, but liked less and less the more I thought about it.

*Rating*: 2.5/5.

**Cyberpunk (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami

*Description*: A man who downloads data directly into his brain in order to encrypt it for the shadowy company he works for finds himself caught in the middle of that company's war with a sinister cabal. 

*Review*: Ignore the description above; it is woefully inadequate. If you've ever read a Murakami novel, you know the man writes weird. This is weirder. This is the weirdest book on a list featuring *The Gray House* and a Beatles-themed epic fantasy. It's good, though. Like a lot of Murakami books, it suffers from its strange descriptions of women and sex, and it's not exactly an action-packed thriller. But as you drift from one bizarre image to the next, it all does add up to something worthwhile. As with *The Gray House*, I'd recommend it only if you have a tolerance for literary and/or experimental fiction.

*Rating*: 3.5/5.

**Second Chance**

*Book*: The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle

*Description*: Upon learning she may be the last of her kind, a unicorn ventures out from her forest to seek her people.

*Review*: This is the greatest book I have ever completely failed to connect to. I can see why people love it so much. It's funny and sad and magical in a way reminiscent of childhood. The prose is hauntingly beautiful. There's no idea explored within it that the author does not take just a step further than another writer might, deepening and complicating it. But for some reason I couldn't enjoy it. The entire time I was reading it, I just wanted it to be over, and I have no clue why.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Afrofuturism**

*Book*: An Unkindness of Ghosts by Rivers Solomon

*Description*: A person enslaved on a generation ship seeks out the truth of her mother's disappearance while trying to survive political turmoil and an overseer's grudge.

*Review*: The characterization in this is brilliant, full of layered emotion and perfectly selected detail. Solomon creates intense people and intense experiences, and pours them over the reader like a bucket of colorful powder. This book is grim and seething with anger, but all the violence (sexual and otherwise) never felt gratuitous to me. I could easily have rated this five stars if the plot had been as well-crafted as every other element; as it is, it kind of falls apart at the end. Still, well worth the read.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Fantasy Novel Published in 2019 (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Infinite Noise by Lauren Shippen

*Description*: A high school football player in therapy to cope with his supernatural empathy grows closer to a boy with depression.

*Review*: I read this because the idea of therapy for people with superpowers intrigued me. I wasn't expecting much, and not much is what I got. It has a sweet romantic A-plot and . . . that's it. Nothing else happens. Even in the romance, there's minimal conflict, just a couple of minor kerfuffles that add up to nothing. On the positive side, it's a feel-good story with some worthwhile messages about mental illness (namely, that love can't cure it).

*Rating*: 1.5/5.

**Middle Grade SFF Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman

*Description*: Equipped with a mysterious device that will truthfully answer any question, a young girl flees her sinister guardian to rescue her best friend from a mysterious organization of child-snatchers.

*Review*: Why did I wait so long to read this series? It's incredible. Lyra is the perfect protagonist, a perfect blend of bravery and vulnerability, recklessness and deep competence. The daemon concept is a storytelling coup, one of the best uses of magic-as-metaphor I've ever seen. And this series is full of that kind of startling imagination. I could write for ages about why *His Dark Materials* is so great, and I wouldn't be the first to do so. If you haven't read it, just try it.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**A Personal Recommendation from** r/Fantasy 

*Book*: Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb

*Description*: The bastard son of a beloved prince is trained as an assassin to serve the family that won't acknowledge him while navigating deadly court intrigue.

*Review*: This is another series I waited way too long to read. For years, I've heard about Robin Hobb's legendary skill with characterization, and I have to say, I finally understand her reputation. Fitz is the kind of character who takes up a place in your soul, and what's more, feels like he's always been there. He's painfully real, as are many of the people around him. On top of that, the book is written with wonderful attention to the everyday, so that you really feel like you're living Fitz's life alongside him, rather than just seeing the most interesting highlights.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**An** r/Fantasy **Book Club Book of the Month/Read-Along Book**

*Book*: Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey

*Description*: A courtesan-priestess chosen by an angel to be a perfect masochist fights to save her country from threats both internal and external.

*Review*: I read a number of great books for this challenge, but this is probably my favorite. Contrary to its reputation as kinky erotica with a fantasy veneer, this is actually an old-fashioned adventure story that just happens to have a fair amount of tastefully-done BDSM. It's told in first person and relies  heavily on the character's exceptional narrative voice. The plot is kept on a slow burn, which I found completely satisfying, as it left a lot of room for fascinating worldbuilding and character work. This is a quality book that even my asexual self managed to wring a lot of enjoyment out of.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**Media Tie-In Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Superman: Dawnbreaker by Matt de la Peña 

*Description*: Young Clark Kent investigates disappearances among Smallville's Hispanic immigrants while struggling to decide what he wants to do with his powers.

*Review*: I'm a sucker for Superman media, and so snatched this up immediately. Unfortunately, it is in no way good. The politics are blindingly unsubtle; even if you agree with the author's points, which I do, they're just clumsily made. It's the progressive equivalent of one of those bad religious movies where any semblance of a good story is lost in the ""message.""

*Rating*: 1/5.

**Novel Featuring an AI Character**

*Book*: Hyperion by Dan Simmons

*Description*: Seven pilgrims share their stories as they seek out a terrifying creature known as the Shrike, who may kill all of them, but who also may grant one of them their deepest desire.

*Review*: This book took me months to read. Not because I didn't like it, but because I unwisely started it during my last semester of grad school. That said, even with continual interruptions, its brilliance came through. It checks every box on the good storytelling checklist and then makes up a few of its own. It even made me cry.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**SFF Novel With a Title of Four or More Words**

*Book*: The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow

*Description*: In the early twentieth century, a teenage girl raised in a wealthy but lonely household discovers a talent for opening portals to other words.

*Review*: This book is beautiful in many ways. Its prose, its careful attention to the social injustices of its time period, and its sparklingly imaginative details all work in its favor. But I still didn't find it entirely satisfying. Maybe it felt a little twee. Still, it's good.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Retelling!** 

*Book*: Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik

*Description*: After gaining a reputation for her ability to ""turn silver into gold,"" a moneylender's daughter is kidnapped by the king of the fairies. Meanwhile, the new bride of the tsar discovers the dark secret at her nation's heart.

*Review*: This book was almost five stars, save for one unfortunate choice at the end. But apart from that one thing I won't spoil, it's marvelous: it has competence porn centered on an awesome cast of women, terrifying use of the environment as an antagonist, and old-fashioned fairy tale magic, both literal and metaphorical. It has characters you ache for and a villain you can sincerely want dead. I've gone back months later to reread passages.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**SFF Novel by an Australian Author**

*Book*: The Shadow of What Was Lost by James Islington

*Description*: A young man discovers he can use a hated form of magic, and must set out on a quest to prevent the re-emergence of an evil long thought dormant.

*Review*: In this series, ~~mages~~ the Gifted are forced to live in prisons known as ~~Circles~~ Tols overseen by ~~Templars~~ Administrators. When they come of age, the must pass a magical test known as the ~~Harrowing~~ Trials, lest they be made ~~Tranquil~~ Shadows. This system is the historical result of a war to overthrow the magocracy of the ~~Magisters~~ Augurs. ...Okay, Licanius is far from a total Dragon Age rip-off, but I had to get that out there. On the whole, I found this book to be pretty mediocre epic fantasy. It had a few good twists, but was ultimately just kind of bland and trope-y.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**The Final Book of a Series (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Powers by Ursula K. Le Guin

*Description*: After his sister is murdered by his master's son, a young man runs away from slavery to learn about his origins and the strange power that he has kept hidden his entire life. The final book in *The Annals of the Western Shore*.

*Review*: Like everything I've read by Le Guin, this book pays careful attention to social realism and to its characters' humanity. There's nothing I'd call action as such. Just people living their lives the best they can in whatever circumstances they find themselves. *Powers* maybe isn't as inspired as some other Le Guin books, but it's consistently interesting and solidly written.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**#OwnVoices (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: A Taste of Honey by Kai Ashante Wilson

*Description*: Caught in a romance forbidden by his culture, a young man navigates the conflict between his duty to his family and his love for a handsome foreign soldier.

*Review*: The fantasy elements in this book are well-implemented and creative, but ultimately take a backseat to the more personal parts of the story. With lush prose and strong characterization, Wilson handles the novella format very well, getting a lot done in a short time without being overambitious. Stylistically this is one of the best books on this list. It also has a killer ending. 

*Rating*: 4/5.

**LitRPG (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Changing Faces by Sarah Lin

*Description*: An RPG villain switches bodies with the game's protagonist and learns that his world is little more than a playground for beings from another dimension. 

*Review*: This was fun. I don't want to be condescending, but if I'm honest, there's no single element here that rises above the level of mediocre fan fiction. Still, it has real heart and is often quite funny. I can see why this genre has a following--it's a typical progression fantasy, but stripped of adulterants and shot right into your veins. I doubt I'll ever read another LitRPG, but I'm glad I read this one.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**Five SFF Short Stories (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler

*Description*: A collection of science fiction short stories on various topics, often with themes humanity trying to maintain its dignity when confronted with more advanced species or with disease.

*Review*: I mean, it's Octavia Butler. Isn't that enough? I put off reading this collection for about a year, because it was the last Butler book I hadn't read. It was as good as thought it would be. Each story has Butler's typical clarity and painstaking psychological realism. Some are inevitably stronger than others, but every one is worth reading. They all do what speculative short fiction is supposed to do: explore an idea in a brief and focused way, with no frills and no reaching outside the scope of the story. And her ideas are always so much bigger, so much more wonderful and more horrifying, than almost anybody else's.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.",1

Except at the end of the book, Sam (the younger of Sabriel and Touchstone's children) is 17 and Lirael is 19.  How old is Ellimere?  I don't think a number is ever put on her, but I had the impression that she's a couple of years older than Sam, which would make her the same age as Lirael.

93,"The dialogue in Steel Crow Saga is distracting and (after a while) frustrating/irritating. Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not. Thoughts?Steel Crow Saga started off so good, but now I'm just kind of bored.
I bought it because the banter between Lee and the Princess was amazing at first, but now I'm just kinda of irritated by Lee's constant snark/ill-timed jokes. I know it's supposed to be funny, and it was, but now I'm just frustrated with her. And I also find the whole Shade summoning thing to be a bit cheesy. I say this knowing it's supposed to be in reference to pokemon (of which I'm a fan). But I just am not feeling it. I also have no idea where the plot is going, and I dont really care anymore. :/

Especially in dark fantasy?Hi guys, I am a very big fantasy fan in general and I am studying game design in general, but what I really want to get is this creativity and fantasy that the best fantasy games have, games like Dark Souls, Shadow Of The Colossus and Legend Of Zelda for example.

Especially in the dark fantasy aspect since I am more interested in it, but what I realized is that most fantasy games, especially the western ones, completely lack creativity, uniqueness, fantasy and magic, their settings, monsters, worlds, magic and fantasy elements in general have this problem. And I don't want to get into that flop that most fantasy games have so I wanted to know guys if you can recommend me ways to increase my fantasy and creativity in general so I can make a decent fantasy game someday that nails the dark fantasy aspect. Because even though I mostly play fantasy games (yeah, that's how much I love fantasy) I believe that I completely lack the creativity that the creators of those fantasy games have.

95,"Recommendations for an all Graphic Novel r/fantasy bingo cardSo, last year as I got so close to doing a graphic novel version of the r/fantasy bingo card, I decided that this year (well technically the 2019 one) I would try to do a complete one.  Despite having read a tonne of comics this year, I've had startling few that would fit into the catergories for bingo (or i've ended up reading the entire series). I'm looking for recommendations in the following catergories: 

Character with a Disablity

Novella - Honestly I'm not sure how you would judge this one so it might be better to have as my one swap out.

Self published 

Vampires

Local Author - if anyone can think of someone who is close to Birmingham, UK that would be awesome. (So far the only one I've read that is a B'ham author wasn't an SFF comic)

Cyberpunk

Afrofuturism - I've been stuck trying to find something that isn't Black Panther. 

Personal Rec - I like comics, the more fun the better! I've read a lot of comics published by Image so something a little more obscure would be amazing!

Four or more word title - I don't know if I should be counting subtitles so I've been trying not to.

96,"Dwarven carrots/mushroom 'beer' experiments: resultsSince [my previous post/rant](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/eqk4to/generic_fantasy_dwarven_beer_is_carrot_wine_let/) about Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer being likely made of carrots (and/or, as others have suggested in the thread, mushrooms) drew some interest, I thought I would post an update on my brewing experiments on the topic (one absolutely horrid, but the other surprisingly promising). I am not entirely sure if that's allowed here - apologies if it's too off-topic for this subreddit - but the overall idea is to see what a hypothetical stereotypical Dwarven civilization with little access to barley (or potatoes - to me, potatoes always seem kind of out of place in medieval-ish fantasy, even though Tolkien himself had no problems putting them in his books) could brew.

As I mentioned in the previous thread, the whole line of thought began because I was making a purple carrot and ginger 'beer' (like ginger beer, it was meant to be more a weird soda than a proper beer - sweeter, negligible ABV, no need of aging beyond a day or two, does not keep long) and I thought that carrots are much more ""dwarfy"" than barley. Since others in the thread mentioned mushrooms, and since that sounded like an amusing idea (one of the things I like about making ginger beer is that, since the ingredients and time investment is much smaller and they don't need much aging, you can try all sorts of nonsense and not be too disappointed if it doesn't pan out), I took some dried mushrooms, minced them, boiled them in water for half an hour, let cool, added the whole thing to the fermenting batch and let rest for a couple of days before bottling and putting in the fridge.

That... did not go well, to say the least. The brew took a rather concerning reddish color (photos at the end); but aesthetics aside, it ended up being much more dry and boozier than I expected - the ABV of ginger beer is usually at most 2%, generally much less, but one could absolutely get drunk on my ginger carrot mushroom abomination (I did not take gravity readings and so I don't know the exact ABV, but I would not be surprised if it were more than 5%). Tasting notes are... well, gross. It does not taste at all like carrots or like mushrooms. I would say that it tastes like a particularly bad prison wine, but I'm pretty sure that no prisoner is *that* desperate for a drink. This is not a drink fit for Dwarves, it is something that even Illithids would feel bad about giving to their thralls. Since I had already made it, and since I'm pretty certain it is not infected (that's usually quite recognizable and it's not it - my guess is that carrots simply have far more fermentable sugars than I expected and the yeast went crazy), I'll let it age for a few weeks and see if it mellows into something halfway drinkable, but I'm not counting on it.

But real Dwarves do not surrender. For my next attempt at making a dwarfy fermented drink, I ditched the carrots and the ginger and the other flavorings and kept things as simple as possible - dried mixed mushrooms, water, sugar, and that's it (credit for the idea goes to [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/eqk4to/generic_fantasy_dwarven_beer_is_carrot_wine_let/fetzl9a/) by u/ImShyBeKind). I did not even use the mushrooms directly at all - rather, I poured boiling water on dried mushrooms, let cool, strained out the mushrooms (which went into my dinner), added sugar to mushroom water, bring to boil, let cool, added yeast, let ferment for a day and something before bottling (in plastic: it might not be lore appropriate, but glass could have been dangerous and I was fresh out of stone jars) This one worked a lot better! I was concerned that the mushrooms would lend no taste at all, but instead I got a distinctly mushroomy-tasting (and looking!) beverage that tastes surprisingly good. As intended, it's more a weird soda than any sort of beer (I'd be surprised if ABV gets to 1% - next time I'll check, and there will be a next time); but the mushroomy sugary flavor is there and is much better than I expected. I could see myself drinking something like that while playing an appropriately dwarfy DnD campaign (if I could find a group to play DnD with without the campaign fizzling out after two sessions at most, but eh). And if one is in the mood for something a little stronger, adding a bit of rum (much like you'd do in a rum and coke) works really well too, I tried. If I may make a criticism, the taste however does not have that much depth - there's the mushrooms, there's the sugar, and that's it. Next time, I'll try adding small amounts of other flavorings and see what happens. But for now, I think that the quest for a properly Dwarven 'beer' is progressing nicely.

[Pictures are here](https://imgur.com/a/PPmuzEv). 

If someone is curious, I can give the full recipe (of the mushroom soda, not of the carrot ginger mushroom Thing That Should Not Be), but it's really.super simple: the only things to worry about are to keep the bottle in fridge and to open it to let it ""burp"" every day or so to avoid bottle geygers...",1

102,"Books similar to Nightlord by Garon WhitedLooking for recommendations of books that are similar to Nightlord. I like that the books are written in the perspective of the main character but any recommendations do not have to be the same. The world building and main character progression is probably the best I've come across and spands genres that I thought were incompatible.

 I think the parts I enjoy the most are the base building parts that can evolve into kingdom building and civilization building.

I also love the mix between science, technology and magic as well as the explanations the main character gives while creating new spells or enchanting. The monologues the main character gives can spand entire chapters, some people might find it boring, but I think it's the best parts.

It was the world-building that sucked me in. That isn’t to say I didn’t enjoy the in-depth grey characters that were delivered in this, but the world was so… surreal and other-worldly it reminded me why I picked up fantasy books so long ago.

Our characters live on ships made of the bones of sea-dragons in a post-apocalyptic world like I’ve never seen before. Lucky Mes has been banished to the Black Ships, the ship of the dead. She conspired to commit treason by making allies of enemies and ending the brutal ritual of child sacrifice. Lucky Mes was made famous by surviving said child sacrifice. It’s said that she caused and then survived a tidal wave defying the custom of slaying the firstborn child of all mothers. Covered in mostly water, the world is dotted with islands that have been at war with each other for so long no one remembers why it started in the first place. Propaganda plagues both the Gaunt Islanders and the 100 islanders alike, each believing the other to be unreasonable barbarians. Lucky Mes hopes to bring the two factions together and find peace between them. Women and men appear to be equals – homosexuality isn’t just normal, it’s the law when on a Black Ship. A man and a woman having sex could create a child and it’s punishable by death.

I found myself loving Lucky Mes and her take-no-shit attitude. She’s incredibly badass but also has a genuinely good purpose and goal, she’s not just a cutthroat asshole like most of those who make up the Black Ships. To be sentenced to the Black Ships you must have committed a crime, and so she’s surrounded by a ton of unsavory characters. This had a grim and foreboding tone most of the time with death lurking around the corner for just about everyone. Joron was really more of our main character, however, and he’s loses his leadership at the very start of the book to none other than Lucky Mes. He’s an alcoholic who sold his maps for more booze, he was picked to be Ship Wife not because he was strong but because he was weak. His crew didn’t want to have a hard-ass leader, so they picked a coward. He had no respect from anyone and has to try and earn it once Lucky Mes takes over.

The world building, as I said earlier, is amazing. There are alien-like bird-people called Windtalkers that can control the weather and the wind. They have their eyes taken from them at birth, they are hunched and sit so completely still they look unnatural and because of that they give everyone on the ship the creeps. Joron and the Tide Child have happened upon a Windtalker that refuses to talk until Lucky Mes…and when he finally does agree to call the wind, it’s the most powerful spell Lucky Mes has ever seen. There are giant eyeless worms that ride the wake of the ships… they bring an unfortunate and brutal end to anyone who falls into the water. This is a world where most women can’t produce children, and many who are born are born with deformities. I could write paragraph after paragraph of how unique and engrossing the world building was, but, that’ll make this review stupidly long.

I didn’t notice how long this book was, I kept turning the page despite how exhausted I was from working all day and coming home to take care of a baby. I just kept fucking reading until 3am when I finally finished. I can’t wait to read the next in a series and that’s saying something because I almost never finish a series anymore.

I don’t read many at-sea adventures, so that was also very refreshing and change of pace for me. The narrator is very good, but also pretty slow. I generally listen at 1.5x but cranked it to 1.8 for this narrator.

***TLDR: Incredible other-worldly feel, unique and original races/creatures, fascinating post-apocalyptic landscape and culture. Grey characters, adventure at sea, trying to end a war, and monsters all written with professional prose that will keep you turning pages. Audiobook was excellent.***

106,"Does anyone know what Children’s Fantasy book I’m thinking of?When I was a child I read a book. I can’t remember what the title was, just a few minor details.

1) It involved 2-3 children who were supposed to be part of a play on Greek mythology getting sent back in time.

2) they meet the Greek gods

3) the one with the (fake) golden Apple is asked to choose between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite but can’t remember who it’s supposed to go to.

4) Zeus asks the kid dressed like a Cyclopes why he has three eyes.

5) Zeus throws a tin foil lightning bolt he got from the other kid (thinking its real) at Hades? Head. 

I can’t remember a d it’s driving me nuts. Does anyone know what I’m talking about?",1
107,"An Fond Farewell to My Old BooksI spent the first 18 years of life in my childhood home in New Jersey, and after 30 years my parents are finally moving.  Today, my mom messaged me and asked if I wanted to keep my old Harry Potter and Dark Tower books...And it was painful, but I said no!  In 2012, I got my trusty kindle (currently kicking strong for my foray into the Gentleman Bastard series which I cannot recommend highly enough) and as such have no need for my old paperback collection.  I live in NYC where space is a commodity, and fitting my hoard of books isn't really an option.

It's hard, but I'm saying goodbye to so many amazing memories.  The Forgotten Realm Series, everything Tolkien, Riftwar Saga, Pendragon (I got a callout in the acknowledgements section - one of the highlights of my childhood), Wheel of Time, Eragon, Earthsea, The 5th Ring, Chronicles of Amber...The list goes on endlessly.  I'm going to miss going home and looking through them all, but it brings me a ton of joy knowing that they'll be donated and hopefully help another kid experience all the same adventures that I did.

I figured a few of you have been through this yourself, and would appreciate the post :)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - The title was originally ""An Ode to My Old Books"", and then I realized this wasn't an ode so I changed the title.  And now I just realized that I forgot to change ""An"" to ""A"".  The embarrassment is real folks.",1
108,"What are some fun/kind of silly fantasy story like A Spell For Chameleon that are also less... uncomfortable?I read Castle Roogna when I was a teen and I remember being kind of charmed by its spritely approach to fantasy, with the concepts of zombies and talking spiders just being like a neighborhood surprise. It kind of reminds me of the vibe of the King's Quest games.

I decided to pick up the first of the Xanth books, A Spell For Chameleon, and it was coming along pretty much the same, with talking trees, centaurs and stuff.

And then the main character attends a trial over a rape accusation. And shortly after there're more than a few suggestions that the lead could be tempted by a pretty girl to do something that would also put him on trial. I mean... I know Castle Roogna also acknowledged sexual topics but they were pretty PG. This is just... yeesh. Especially seeing as it otherwise reads like a book for young readers.

Not to mention that on two occasions now, the book's implied that 14-yr old girls are enticing.

So yeah, I'd like to find out about some goofy fantasy stories that are less of... all that.",1
109,"Help with identifying book - heroine with powers, romantic interest has powers that mimic her, works for some sort of enforcement angencyAs per title. 

I read it years ago, series about a girl training to be part of an enforcement agency, her powers are very strong, the only one whose powers are as strong as hers is her rival (and eventual love interest -his powers are actually to mimic powers). Enforcement agency turns out to not be the good guys. Any help is much appreciated.",1
110,"Best Served Cold QuestionI read The First Law trilogy over five years ago. I want to read Best Served Cold, but don't really remember much of where we left off. Is Best Served Cold a direct continuation, or does it not really matter?",1
111,"The Gutter Prayer by Gareth Ryder-HanrahanI may have come late, by some standards, to this book finishing it as I did in 2020 (and starting it in very late 2019). However, I'll say it is brilliant.  

If you haven't tried it yet, you should be giving it a read - noirish, Dickens-ish/Victorian kind of world feel, with some steampunk elements, and some downright weird-s\*\*t going on... lots of players, lots of agendas, and lots to enjoy for the reader.

I'd best get on with the sequel!",1
112,"I'm looking for recommendationsWhat are your favorite fantasy books that are set in another world and have some sort of magic in them?

In the past year and a half I've been getting back into fantasy after quite a long break from reading. So far I've encountered a lot of urban fantasy and vampire books, but they just don't touch my heartstrings in the old Tolkien sense of way. I've also read a bit of fantasy romance, but I don't prefer those, even if they can also be exciting. I'd rather not have romance, at least not as the main theme. 

For example I liked the Bridge Kingdom by Danielle L. Jensen, but hated her Stolen Songbird series. The plot was way better in the former and the latter reminded me of Twilight. I liked Uprooted by Naomi Novik, but not the romance part of it. Same goes for The Ghost Bride by Yangsze Choo. 

I've read most of N.K. Jemisins books and enjoy them very much, although they are a bit dark. 

I gave up on A Song of Ice and Fire #5 at pp 130 because it was just too damn long and there was nothing happening in it. I adored the first three books in the series though. 

I've read the first Mistborn book by Sanderson. The beginning was so slow and long, I struggled to get through it, but man, the ending was so worth it. It was masterful. I'm definitely going to continue reading the series, but I need a break. However, I hated the first Stormlight archive book and gave up after 4 chapters. It was the first book by Sanderson I read, but then I saw him say in a lecture that it wasn't perhaps the best choice until you got to know his style more first and learned to trust him. So...maybe I'll try again later.

I like Philip Pullman's Northen Light's series and I've of course also read Harry Potter and everything Tolkien a long time ago and loved those.

I loved the Forest Kingdom by Simon R. Green. It was light, funny and satyrical. 

I DNFd Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett.

I've tried starting several more books, but so many of them start slow and heavy. I just want to be swept up in a book in the first chapter right now.

Can you guys recommend any quick paced, funny adventure fantasies in alternate worlds with magic? I'm really craving that now. Like really really.

No middle grade books, please. I don't mind YA if it's without romance, but I prefer adult. I go for any type of magic system, soft or hard, I don't care as long as there is magic. Humor is always a big plus.",1
113,"Why do you like your favorite books?What about your favorite books makes them your favorite? Also if you don't like other popular books/series what about them prevents you from enjoying them?

I love Malazan, Stormlight and recently the Licanius trilogy. While Malazan is definitely different than the other two, they all have a high level of ""Epicness"" and satisfying conclusions that tie in to the rest of the books. 

I specifically like how Stormlight's conflict has been growing with the emergence of its magic system, and a lot of the moments in the second and third books have more of an impact because of the work done in Way of Kings to establish the world.

Malazan is just high fantasy all the time and while that can make the magic seem normal after a few books, Memories of Ice is probably my favorite book of all time because of how well it expands on Gardens of the Moon and how complete the story feels by the end.

I've been impressed by Licanius from about half-way through the first book until that final conclusion because of how tight-knit the plot is and everything comes together very smoothly. It really feels like The whole story was well thought out before the author even started writing book one. The only thing I don't like about a plot that's so woven together is just that it removes really any of the mystery by the end. I like those big reveal kind of moments but I enjoy having a few unanswered questions to think about when I've finished a book/series.

As far as a popular series I am not a fan of, Wheel of Time is unfortunately my go to. I've really tried to like this series but I cant get over a lot of the more well known flaws, especially the drawn-out plot and the unrealistic female characters. The long paragraphs of description never bothered me as I tend to skim those sections in most books I read, though I couldn't really say why.

I'd love to read some other/contrasting opinions to mine, what do you all think?",1
114,"Witcher saga and Forgotten Realms Legend of Drizzt GraphicaudioI would pay buckets of money to hear  Graphicaudio productions of The legend of Drizzt and Witcher series!

Victor Bevine does a really good job but it's still very enjoyable to have the sound effects of combat music etc. and individual voices imo.

If I had to choose one over the other to become graphicaudio it would definitely be The Witcher saga, because from hearing the sample of the audible narrated by Peter Kenny I just don't think I could enjoy the story because his accent and voice is just too much. 

Not exactly annoying, but just completely different from the narrating I like, such as Michael Kramer, and of course Victor Bevine.

Anyone else feel the same?",1
115,"Plot hole/mystery for Guy Gabriel Kay's Lord of Emperors? (Minor spoiler alert)A small thing, but it keeps bugging me: hopefully not too much of a spoiler without the context, but:

After the Bassanid doctor helps the Empress escape, she leaves in his house a golden rose which he had admired earlier. My question: She's in disguise and fleeing for her life at that point, and the rose, of course, is back at the palace, and the entire city is searching for her. How did she get the rose from the palace to the doctor?

But apart from that, I think the Sarantine Mosaic is my very favorite GGK tale, other than perhaps Last Light of the Sun. (Also, I misspelled his name in the title line, I know!)",1

117,"What are fantasy/Sci fi books that surprised you and that disappointed you?Basically a book you had high hopes for that disappointed you and a book that you had few hopes for that surprised you positively. To make my own example:

-Disappointed: Dune by Frank Herbert. I actually liked the book but was expecting more than what I got. I like the idea of the book and its background more than the book itself, the worldbuilding and plotting are wonderful, specially the former, and I honestly can't say it was bad at all, but I didn't enjoy reading it too much, and I was expecting more from the writting and the characterization. I thought it was fine, but it's its vision and influence that elevate the work into the status of being a masterpiece. It's the kind of book I admire more than I like, like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevski.

-Surprised: A Feast for Crows by George RR Martin. The infamous ugly duck in the series, I was expecting to be bored to tears, but it was much more enjoyable than I expected. Sure it might be my least favourite in the series, but it's not as bad as I expected it to be, it's biggest problem comes from the fact that it doesn't feel like a novel anymore, more like a streamline of story archs put together that flow like one continues block of storytelling, and that it got so generous in worldbuilding and background descriptions that it might have been a boring experience for some readers. Most of the favourite POVs are absent and instead you get things like Brienne or Sam. But I honestly can't hate a book with Brienne's second half, or Cersei's arch or Jamie's final chapter. Arya and Sansa were wonderful, but they feel more uncomplete, and ADWD didn't satisfy readers enough for this. It's not perfect, but I still consider it to be a great book.

So what about you? What book did you find disappointing or surprising?",1
118,"What is the appeal of Dungeon Core?Asking as someone unfamiliar with the genre who only recently started reading LitRPG.

120,"The Craft Sequence -- question about Mina Altemoc (spoilers)In Two Serpents Rise, Caleb says that his mother died after the Skittersill Rising.

EDIT: This was Mal, not Caleb, see Ximenyr's comment below.

""They stood against the Red King in the Skittersill Rising , and fell. And burned. My mother took a week to die.""

In Last First Snow, Mina does not participate in the rising (she runs off with Caleb after his father applies the scars), and she was alive and well in the last scene of the book...

Whats up with the discrepancy here? Did Mina die or not? If not, why does Caleb think she did, and where is she?

I've been reading in publication order, so maybe Four Roads Cross or The Ruins of Angels will clear this up?",1
121,"Authors, how much of a boost in sales do you see when giving away a free book?So, as a longtime lurker of this sub, it's not too uncommon to see an author giving away a free first-book when they've published a sequel, or for a debut author to make their book free for the first few days.

I assume that the point is to get people hooked on the series once they read the first book, and to spread word of mouth. How much does this actually affect your sales, though?

I generally treat free books as I treat free games on my steam library - I purchase them (when they're free) and then proceed to forget about them. I've read maybe a handful of the free books I've purchased.

And yet, people keep giving out free books, so there *must* be a benefit here on the authors part, meaning that people like me aren't significant. So my question, dear authors who lurk on this subreddit is this: how much of a boost of sales did you notice after giving away a free book?

Edit: thank you all for the answers!",1

124,"[Review] Balance of Magic by Jeffrey L. KohanekI'm a little slow getting this posted this was a review request from the author. Thank you to Jeffrey Kohanek for the ARC. Sorry it's so late.

\-

&amp;#x200B;

Following the death of the wizard Taladain, our friends are on the run. The princess Narine fearing her brother (Prince Eldalain) will blame her for their father, Lord Taladain’s death escapes with Jace, Rhoa and Salvon along with her lifelong friend and bodyguard Adyn.

\-

The Balance of Magic picks up almost directly after the events of Eye of Obscurance and is just as fast paced and fun as the first. The world has gotten a little more complicated as it opens up and we meet new characters and travel to new places. As the plot thickens some of the minor characters get bigger arcs and their backstories filled in this time around.

**Of our friends-**

Narine moves into the limelight, as she and Jace are developing a relationship. Rawk meets up with an uncle who was kicked out of the clan, the same as himself. And Salvon believes Rhoa is the anomaly that was predicted, and is immune to magic and illusions.

**Of our villains-**

Cordelia is working behind the scenes for whoever benefits her guild the most. Rindle is still trying to prove himself better than Jace. Eladain intends to declare martial law, therefore handing the throne and power of the Fastella to himself (at least for the next few months). And Parsec’s is working towards challenging Eladain, for that same throne.

That was just the tip of the iceberg.

I always worry I’m not going to be able to keep everyone straight because there are so many characters and so much going on with them and you all know me and my notorious inability to remember names (this is why all my bunnies just inherit by default any name of a rabbit they look similar to). But I have learned with Jeffrey Kohanek to not stress too much about it because it all works itself out in the wash. As the unimportant people fall away, and the main characters move forward, those characters usually have enough quirks or events happening to them that I can keep them straight for the most part.

The only issues I had this time was with the wizards- keeping track of who’s on top in which city, and who’s trying to topple whom, was a bit tricky. It does eventually get easier as the details start sticking.

I can always count on Jeffrey Kohanek’s books for fast paced entertainment and this didn’t disappoint. With lots of twisty behind the scenes plots as the balance of power shifts from one wizard to another, there are quite a few surprises along the way including the appearance of a magic-based dragon! Always good fun.

Other notes-

This is getting a little more adult with the relationships and a few scenes of gore but still rather mild in comparison to some of what’s out there. I’d let my teen read it but that’s just me.

I mentioned in the review of Eye of Obscurance, how I was sad about Rhoa not having much thought about her leaving her found family and we do get a little here as she sees them in passing and regrets the loss of their company etc. I liked that.

But with the mysterious deaths of his father and brother, it seems the new Lord Crane has inherited an earldom. He’s also inherited his family’s enemies. He needs magical assistance, fast. He doesn't expect it to turn up angry.

And though I can't say I disliked any of the book, the last few chapters from Syenite's perspective really didn't hold my attention as well. Overall, it didn't make much a difference because I was more than happy to dive into the next book, but I wondered if anyone else felt the same?",1

I find myself reading children's books just to avoid the current fixation on romance or horror. Harry Potter was a great series and not devoid of tension, fear, love. I have enjoyed Martha Wells, Melinda Salisbury, Steven Brust, Brandon Sanderson but have read everything they have written.",1
128,"[Review] The Republic of Thieves by Scott Lynch - Love Sabetha and can't wait to read volume 4#http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1774-therepublicofthieves



4.5/5

The third volume of the Gentleman Bastard series threatens to change the entire course of the series. It is a book which contains a shocking revelation about Locke Lamora's past which, potentially, could alter everything we know about the character. I'm not a big fan of this revelation and the only reason I'm not upset about is due to fact that, being a book about con games, it's entirely possible everything revealed was a lie. So, of course, I'm going to have to purchase the next book to find out if it's true. Clever.

Of course, for a long time it seemed that this would be the last of the Gentleman Bastard series. Scott Lynch ran into a bunch of issues that it's not my place to comment on other than to say he has my deepest sympathy. I'm pleased to have since heard that he's not only completed the 4th book in the series but that he's planning more volumes in this incredibly hilarious yet dark and gritty fantasy epic.

The book's premise is Locke Lamora suffering from poison he ingested in Red Seas Under Red Skies. Jean, his partner in crime, is desperate to find a cure and willing to do anything. The solution comes in the form of Locke and Jean's mortal enemies: the bondsmagi. Introduced in The Lies of Locke Lamora, the bondsmagi were behind the troubles our heroes faced in the previous volume. One of the bondsmagi's leaders, going by the name Patience, is willing to help Locke recover if he and Jean agree to fix an election on the wizards' island of Karthain. This would be small potatoes for the world's greatest con men if not for the fact they're opposed by the only thief and liar equal to them: Locke's ex-girlfriend Sabetha.

Sabetha has been built up for two books as the love of Locke's life and it's a hard task to make us believe she's equal to the task. Much to my surprise, Scott Lynch decided to go a different way. Sabetha is every bit as capable, intelligent, and charming as Locke. She could easily be the star of the series herself. It's just Locke can't see her that way and continually sticks his foot in his mouth due to the inability to see her as anything but his one true loveTM. Sabetha would very much like to be recognized as the world's greatest thief but, beside Locke, she's also regulated to being his supporting cast. She can't stand that. It's an interesting bit of metatextuality since, by nature, Sabetha is a member of Locke's supporting cast. Despite this, she insists on being taken on her own terms. When she refers to her past adventures, they often take on the same sort of life Locke and Jean's do. I, for one, would love to have a Sabetha novel.

Sabetha is an interesting character and one that I think will rub readers either the wrong way or rapidly become their favorite. She has no interest in being the ""perfect girlfriend"" and supportive to Locke but I think all of her issues with him are justified. Their relationship reminds me a great deal of Jackal and Fetch's from The Grey Bastards. Locke has mentally slot Sabetha into the role of being his Maid Marian and he just can't parse that she doesn't want to be his sidekick. It's one of the rare stories where I love the romance while absolutely wanting them not to get together.

Much of the book has a Lupin the Third style comedy-of-errors where Sabetha and Locke keep trying to one up the other in terms of rigging the election. The rest of the book involves an extended flash-back to the heroes joining a troupe of Shakesperian actors with a complete jackass for a troupe master. Needless to say, Locke and Sabetha dig themselves a very deep hole trying to help their (literally) indebted friends. I liked both parts of the book but wish they'd been separate volumes since they don't really fit together well. Still, I think it was a good idea to make sure we were able to see the ""good times"" as well as the ""bad times"" of Sabetha and Locke. The thing is that the bad times don't actually seem to be all that bad as Sabetha and Locke are only friendly rivals at worse for the majority of the book. They may be on opposite sides of a job but neither wishes the other harm.

The book is significantly more lighthearted than previous entries in the series. After the bloody mess of the first and second books, this is a welcome emotional rest. Favorite moments include Locke and Jean getting knocked out and dumped on a luxurious boat out to sea in order to keep them from the election, Locke walking in on Jean while he's losing his virginity (which is a simple but hilarious gag in context), and disposing of a dead nobleman who has 'accidentally' walked into a pair of scissors. Compared to the gritty mission of revenge in The Lies of Locke Lamora and the horrific fate of certain characters in Red Seas under Red Skies, it feels like a walk in the park.

I will say the ending will prove controversial to some readers (myself included) and what it means in the long term is something we'll have to wait for the 4th volume to explain. I do feel one of the choices, bringing back a previous villain, was a mistake since his previous defeat was properly epic. I also think that the ""revelations"" made by another villain work better as lies told in order to destroy Locke's happiness rather than something sincere. Either way, it's a small complaint about a book that I rank as my second favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite dark fantasy novels.

In conclusion, The Republic of Thieves is a significant improvement over the last volume but the twist leaves a sour taste in my mouth. There's also the return of a villain I'd hoped was over and done with. Nevertheless, I'm going to be purchasing the next volume the day it comes out. That, alone, should tell you Scott Lynch has got his hooks into me.",1
129,"Forgotten Fantasies: 4 Mini Reviews of Under-read Specfic NovelsLast year I mostly read new releases that everyone else was buzzing about. And it was great! There were lesbian necromancers in space, lesbian time travelers writing letters, and a lot of doors (ten thousand, to be exact). But part of what I love about the genre is that feeling of discovery when you come across an undiscovered gem, so this year I made a resolution to myself to read more broadly. To that effect, I thought it would be fun to do round-ups of mini-reviews for books with a paucity of reviews on Goodreads. (What counts as ""a paucity""? Whatever I say counts, dear reader, by which I mean I attempted to set a hard limit of ""under 200 reviews"" and then promptly broke that limit when I wrote this post because I wanted to gush about a book with 324 reviews. Oops).

So, what's on tap this time? We've got a nice spread, something for everyone:

* A bitter satire of Canadian academia with horror/magical realism elements
* A near-future feel-good YA thriller featuring an AI addicted to cat pictures
* An atmospheric southwestern urban fantasy with magic horses
* Actually, it's About Ethics in Middle-Grade Minecraft Tie-In Novels

So, without further ado, join me in welcoming...

# [Dr. Edith Vane and the Hares of Crawley Hall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31944733-dr-edith-vane-and-the-hares-of-crawley-hall)

* By Suzette Mayr, published 2017, 174 ratings
* **Bingo categories:** slice-of-life (hard mode), local author (Calgary), four-or-more word title (hard mode), OwnVoices (hard mode)
* **The Story:**  Dr. Edith Vane is a professor English literature at a fictional Canadian university, and a bit of a mess. All she wants to do is research her hero, pioneer housewife memoirist Beulah  Crump-Withers, but everything seems set against her. The school's dean won't talk to her, other professors are out to steal her work, her new girlfriend is playing games with her heart, and the English department's building is possibly sentient and definitely malevolent. And something odd is going on with the campus rabbits...
* **My Take:** I dearly hope the author already has tenure, because this book is *angry*. Everyone in this is terrible: from the business-obsessed university administrators to Edith's bloodthirsty fellow professors to her useless students to Edith herself. Edith *especially*, since you're stuck in her head for 200 pages- she's insecure, spiteful, jealous, and indecisive (and also happens to be a WOC and a lesbian). Of course, the awfulness of Edith and everyone else involved in the University is kind of the book's point: the environment of academia twists everyone and everything it touches, to the extent that the school building itself is an evil force to be reckoned with. The building is a font of creeping wrongness, but the horror elements are subtle; this book won't work if you're looking for out-and-out monsters (in general, the book is much more literary fiction than typical specfic). But if you love or hate academia, relate with wanting to stab your coworkers and/or bosses to death with shitty plastic office cutlery, and think rabbits are creepy AF, you might like this one.

# [Catfishing on Catnet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41556068-catfishing-on-catnet)

* By Naomi Kritzer, published 2019, 324 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** local author (Minneapolis St. Paul), AI (hard mode), published 2019, maybe cyberpunk?
* **The Story:** Steph is your typical teenager, with the not-so-typical twist that she and her mother are constantly moving to keep out of the clutches of Steph's abusive father. Because she never stays in one place for long, Steph has few friends in real life, preferring a tight-knit group of internet friends on the near-future platform known as CatNet. When Steph makes new friends in the real world that are threatened by her father, it's up to CatNet to help. Oh, and CatNet is a sentient AI addicted to pictures of cats.
* **My Take:** I loved this so much! I'd read and loved the short story (famous for winning the Hugo and pissing off the puppies in the process), and had been waiting for the book with bated breath since I heard Kritzer was writing it. It does not disappoint! This is a heartfelt, sweet, and fun story. The tech takes a back seat to the exploration of how online friendships form and function, so anyone looking for hard scifi will likely be disappointed. But if you've ever been on a platform (like, say, Reddit!) where you managed to form those weird close friendships where you know your friend's favorite animal but have no idea what their real name is, this will probably ring true. Also, though the focus is on Steph, CatNet is a delight. Think Murderbot, but way less jaded and way, way more bullish on helping the humans (CatNet is definitely a Gryffindor). Kritzer really manages ""I'm a genius AI that can access information all over the world but also I'm technically not very old and haven't quite figured out when NOT to access all the info. The thriller parts are enjoyable too, though some parts might strike some readers as a bit too coincidence-heavy. The main story wraps up nicely, but there's a hook for a sequel, one I hope Kritzer writes.

# [Dragons in the Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31752269-dragons-in-the-earth)

* By Judith Tarr, published 2016, 34 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** small-scale (hard mode), local author (Arizona), self published (hard mode), four-or-more word title
* **The Story:** Claire is a down-on-her luck former academic with the ability to talk to animals that works on a horse ranch in the Arizona desert. A pair of strangers contacts her with a too-good-to-be-true proposal: watch over a herd of beautiful horses and see to their every need, in exchange for a massive salary, no strings attached. She warily accepts and subsequently falls in love with the horses, but begins to suspect that there's more to them than meets the eye. Throw in Ancient Mesopotamian mythology and a shadowy global corporation, and all bets are off. 
* **My Take:** This was a lovely, gentle read. Claire is a great protagonist: a bit cranky, not so big a fan of humans, and old enough to have aches and pains. Even better were the horses. You can tell Tarr knows and loves horses (she raises and trains Lipizzan horses herself) which is a refreshing antidote to ye fantasy horse machines that dutifully gallop for 9 hours a day and don't eat. All the horses have personalities and temperaments, and the deep and abiding love both Claire and Tarr feel for the horses really shines through. This is also a paean to rural Arizona and the desert, so if that's a setting you enjoy you'll probably like this. The plot takes back-seat to the setting; the focus of the narrative is more on the day to day rhythm of the barn, and I think it was because of this and the relative shortness of the story that the climax felt a bit rushed to me, but I found I really didn't mind.

# [Minecraft: The End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43658932-minecraft)

* By Cat Valente, published 2019, 33 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** twins (hard mode), published 2019, local author (Maine), middle grade (hard mode), tie-in (hard mode), possibly litRPG (hard mode)
* **The Story:** Fin and Mo are twin endermen that live together in the mysterious world of The End. Shunned by most of their kind, they spend their days scavenging for loot and keeping each other company- until humans invade The End, threatening to kill all of the Endermen and harvest their bodies. But when Fin and Mo come face to face with the humans, they begin to question everything they've ever known about their world, their people, and themselves...
* **My Take:** This book has the highest rating of these four novels on Goodreads but was my least favorite, which just goes to show you that ~~sometimes people are wrong on the internet~~  you shouldn't always trust reviews. First off- and I fully recognize that this isn't quite fair- when I pick up a Valente book, I expect a certain... Valente-ness. And there was a bit, but I got the feeling that she'd decided (or been asked) to massively tone it down. Space Opera this is not. I suppose you could argue it's not fair to expect that level of prose for a middle grade book, but she did it just fine in her Fairyland books. However, my biggest issue was actually the way the ethical issues in the story were resolved, or more accurately, not resolved. Now, I haven't played Minecraft so I'm guessing a bit, but my general understanding is this: in the game, the endermen are not player characters, but monsters that automatically attack players and have to be killed. Valente decided to tell a story from their point of view and give them a culture and language and emotions, etc. When humans show up trying to kill them, they're understandably distraught and afraid, and there's lots of in-book debates about whether the humans are morally wrong. So much of the narrative is devoted to debating this question that it seems pretty clear that ultimately the humans are going to be (rightly) condemned for their actions. And then... they aren't. I'm paraphrasing, but it goes something like: ""You come to our home, you kill us for fun, you harvest our body parts for loot!"" says the enderman. ""Well, yeah,"" says the human, ""but you kill and eat plants, so we're not really so different. Also murder is fun."" I mean, what?! My guess is that Valente realized she couldn't outright condemn the players' actions because this is of course a Minecraft tie-in novel, being marketed primarily to middle-grade readers that are fans of Minecraft. You can't tell a bunch of twelve year olds they're routinely committing genocide and they should be ashamed of themselves, you just can't. But it's weird, because that's clearly the story that was almost, but not quite, being told. Also, the ending is uh, dark in a way I was not expecting; it's revealed that &gt;!the endermen twins are not endermen or twins at all, but human strangers that were caught in an amnesia spell and have been reliving the same brief lives of alienation and abandonment over and over again, unable to escape. Upon realizing this they rally with their new human friends to break free, except they fail and their friends also get caught in the spell and it all starts over again. The fact that the twins aren't even endermen sort of problematizes the whole ""endermen are people too!"" thing that Valente doesn't quite commit to, but I was more boggled that she wrote an outright tragedy lol.!&lt;On a positive note, I did like the baby zombie horse.",1
130,"Any books or series centered around centaurs that are not complete pulp?I find centaurs fascinating creatures with great potential for their own stories, but whatever story I come across, if there are centaurs, there is usually one or two minor centaur characters and that's it.

I was just rereading the first Harry Potter the other day and I found The Forbidden Forest to be among the most interesting parts of the book, mostly because of the centaurs. And later when I was reading up some backstory on Firenze and reminded myself of his appearances in later books, I was like ""Damn, this guy deserves a whole book for himself, if not a series.""

Now, since there is about 1% chance that J. K. Rowling will ever write anything centred on centaurs and/or Firenze, I was wonderijg if there are any books or series which feature centaurs in large part or at least have an interesting centaur character that's not just a minor character? I looked some up, but only found pulp presumably written by some who were just thirsty for centaurs. Anyone got any recommendations?",1
131,"Looking for a lesbian erotic fantasy audiobook... narrated by a womanI love fantasy novels with lesbian themes, and I recently listened to one (can't read in transit, so I have to listen) that had some fairly spicy bits... but having it read by a male narrator seemed *weird*.

It's definitely a niche request, but any suggestions are appreciated. Swords and sorcery preferred but sci-fi can be good as well.",1
132,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Last Battle by CS Lewis... would a film adaptation even be possible without backlash or terrible reviews? (spoilers)\-Here are the villains: Calormen (""Colored Men"") who are dark-skinned Muslims, an ape, a cat, Allah who is also Satan because Lewis claims they're the same, and some atheist Dwarves who call the Calormen ""darkies"" multiple times (""darkie"" is an actual slur used in Australia and maybe elsewhere; I mainly saw it used to describe aborigines when I was in Australia). Some have taken Shift the Ape to be a racist metaphor for black people, though I'm not sure I'd agree, but the Calormen are definitely bound to give someone a heart attack if they show up in a film adaptation. The only villain who won't offend anyone is Ginger the cat.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The heroes literally disguise themselves using blackface to blend in with the Calormen.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As mentioned above, Tash = Allah = Satan. If you claim Allah and Jesus are the same, Lewis says you're wrong, and worse, probably damned to hell. Allah is the devil here. This will certainly go over well with modern audiences, like a fart in a submarine. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The problem with Susan. She's now an atheist who thinks Narnia was just a dumb fairy tale. She also likes fashion and boys more than Jesus. She would burn in hell for these grave offenses against God, if only she was present for...

&amp;#x200B;

\-The freak train accident. Everyone's dead except Susan because she was elsewhere having fun. But its cool because they all get to heaven right? Not a tear shed over it, we don't even get to really hear the characters' thoughts on what happened because Aslan tells them they're dead at the very, very end of the book. ""The life you're living now doesn't matter; only when you die and get to heaven will your life really matter"" is apparently the message. Oh and Susan has to mourn HER WHOLE FAMILY. You can't expect the average film audience to accept this as a happy or even bittersweet ending.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The magical stable door thing is confusing. Yes I get that it is a gateway to heaven, a gateway to hell, and a gateway to a purgatory of sorts (the dwarves' fate). But the stable just shows up out of nowhere. Its just there. Why did Aslan choose that for his gate? Why did he choose Shift's deception as his time to end Narnia? Why did Tash even show up? Can we elaborate on Tash a bit? Maybe he was like the Morgoth to Jadis' Sauron? Okay okay, maybe the answers to some of these questions might be found in the Book of Revelations, but movie audiences will expect this movie to stand on its own legs. In previous Narnia books, if the Christian symbolism flew over your head, its fine, you could still enjoy the story... but not here. Not when the symbolism BECOMES the story. If you don't know Revelations before seeing this film, you're in for a horrible time. The story is just a series of things happening that won't make any sense unless you paid attention in church or read the Bible.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Some Christians themselves might take offense to: the concept that every good deed belongs to Jesus and every evil deed belongs to Satan, even unwittingly. So, a Calormen, that is, a dark-skinned Satanist-Muslim (they're the same thing here) is forgiven by Aslan and accepted into Heaven despite serving Tash/Satan/Allah his whole life, since, despite serving the wrong god, his services to that god were noble. I don't think that's how it works in Christianity, at least the circles I'm familiar with. This is what I was taught as a kid: You have to accept Jesus as your savior BEFORE YOU DIE to go to heaven, and if you don't, it doesn't matter how honorably you behaved or how little you've sinned, you're going to hell because you didn't accept Christ during your mortal lifetime. Good deeds are nice, but acceptance of Christ is a MUST, or all those good deeds don't mean jack. The Calorman in question accepts Aslan alright, AFTER he is dead, already in heaven, and spent a lifetime serving Satanic Allah. Letting this guy into heaven is possibly controversial. Imagine if I worshipped Satan my whole life but gave every penny I earned to the homeless shelter and provided tireless community service to them, am I going to heaven or hell? 

&amp;#x200B;

Adapting this piece of work will not be an easy task. My recommendations: Cut out the train accident, let everyone live, make Susan not an atheist and have her show up with the others. Punish Puzzle for his actions; he knew what he was doing was wrong and did it anyway. Change the name ""Calormen"" to something else and make them racially diverse, including some white dudes, and don't make them Muslim or anything close. Tash=Satan is okay, Tash=Satan=Allah is not okay. Censor the dwarves' racial slurs. Tirian finds some other disguise or strategy that doesn't involve wearing blackface. Explain the stable, Aslan's decision to end the world at this particular time, and Tash a little better. Let that one Calorman into heaven, but skip that whole ""good deeds in another god's service equal good deeds towards me"" thing for the sake of not pissing off the Christian audience. Make the third act more of a coherent story and less of a series of biblical events that happen one after another. Spend more time with Tirian and Jewel in the first act, let's get to know them a little better before throwing them into the plot. Make Tirian a more competent king; that is, don't let the Calormen enslave the animals and capture Caer Paravel without him having a damn clue any of it is coming. Reference the Book of Revelations to explain things if need be, but be subtle about it.... dammit, I really am cutting Lewis' vision to ribbons here... I could understand Peter Jackson cutting out Tom Bombadil, but these cuts and changes are MANY.

How can you discuss the 1940's to now without discussing oil and its how its presence in the Islamic world and the geopolitical consequences of that or Communism or Facism etc. etc. There are overarching not just conflicts but economic forces that permeate. Its tough to discuss Europe and its rise without talking about Catholicism or in some ways even Greco-Roman. Is there fantasy that doesn't ape these forces but does a good job of creating its own. Offhand the Broken Earth comes to mind. Tolkien I think mostly apes and doesn't define its own. I don't just mean having these things exist but having the setting sort of drip with their influence.

&gt;As the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect, Wei WuXian roamed the world in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the chaos he created. In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest shidi and killed by powerful clans that combined to overpower him.

From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei WuXian slowly realizes that Lan WangJi, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei WuXian than he is letting on.

It is popular enough in China that it has been adapted as an apparently pretty popular [live-action TV series](https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228), a [manhua](https://exiledrebelsscanlations.com/the-grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation/), an [audio drama](https://www.missevan.com/mdrama/drama/19059#t=0&amp;e=1) and [an animated series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m346FShZ5Dc). The animation in particular won numerous awards.

The story is [heart-breaking but really touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsR5udgSGXY) so if you're tired of the very bland straight relationships that seem to predominate xianxia this is a great break.

Another thing to note is that at only 126 chapters, it is *very* short compared to most mainstream webnovels, which often clock in at something like 15 times that long. It is not a completely happy ending where everyone lives happily ever after, characters die and not everything is magically set right in the end. The villains mostly have decent reasons for what they do. You might not agree with them, but they have explanations for why they want to do whatever. The main characters have flaws, and make mistakes.",1

146,"Tales of the New Sun - When's it Get Good?So I got half the series, trying to find books 3 and 4 in a format I like. I keep hearing how great it is.

I finished book one...and just about nothing happened. Like, effectively, nothing at all.

Now, mind you, I don't mind slow books. I don't mind books full of worldbuilding. But something has to happen. Even say, ""Spice and Wolf"", a notoriously slow and worldbuildy book series from Japan has something happening in it.

Book one barely had anything happen though. Like, three things, maybe, can be considered major. He starts on a journey, he fights a duel, and he meets up with a traveling acting troupe. And that's really it. 

There was no conclusion of any sort. There was no lesson learned. There was no ending. The first book simply ended because it ran out of pages.

I WANT to like this, mind you. But really, something has to happen, there should be a payoff of some sort. I felt like book one was a waste.

If the entire fan fervor for this is because it's set in the far future, I'm afraid it's not going to do anything for me, Clark Ashton Smith's ""Zothique"" stories satiate that need far better to me.

When's it get good? If I finish all four is the payoff worthwhile? Are there lessons learned, life altering questions asked, and so forth? Does Gene Wolfe ever stop writing like he's just bought one of those ""Obscure Words a Day"" daily calendars? 

Like I said, I WANT to like it. But if book 2-4 is just basically more of book 1, well, I may put reading it on the backburner somewhere.",1
147,"The Ten Thousand Doors of January -- an amazing readI just finished The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix Harrow and I am just blown away!  I am a big reader (roughly 50 books a year) and although I enjoy most of what I read I am not used to being so affected by a book.  This is one of those rare gems.  I will not review it, but I will say first and foremost, it's a portal fantasy, so if you like those, then this is a must read.  But more than just doors to other realities, this is a book about family and the lengths people go to keep that connection.  It's about friendship and found family.  It's about openness to new experiences in a world that wants to control what we see, think and do.  And it's also about power and it's misuse.  I cannot say enough about this book.

149,"Para's Proper Reviews: My foray into Star Wars (Part 5: Rogue One and Solo)*Rogue One* and *Solo* were the last two movies left for me to watch before I dived into the shows and books. I initially intended to watch them much earlier (release order and all), but in the end, it made more sense to leave them for last – both because it made more sense to group them together separately from the sequels and because I wanted to watch *The Rise of Skywalker* as soon as possible to avoid spoilers.

As for the two movies themselves? I find them incredibly intersting to compare. So similar in so many ways, yet one was a riot and the other…not so much.


#Rogue One (2016)
*Rogue One* is one half of a good movie bolted onto one half of a bad movie. And I have no idea what to make of that.

The concept, the story of how the rebels got the Death Star plans, seemed excellent. I heard it was gritty before going in, which should have made it right up my alley. And that there was a sassy droid, which, ditto. I broke my release order rule and saved it for after Solo, thinking (based on their reputations) I should do the best one last, but I really should have stuck to release order.

The main problem of *Rogue One* is that the first half to two thirds of it are *insanely* boring. In a Star Wars movie, this is practically a cardinal sin. And the main reason for that is that literally none of the many(!) characters has anything even remotely resembling a personality. They’re 0.5 dimensional at best. If I had to choose one or two words to describe them, I couldn’t – they’re just chess pieces for the plot to move around. And while the concept is good and it sounds great when you put it in bulletpoints, and there’s plenty of eye candy (the costumes, the settings…the pilot…), the pacing is terrible. I kept pausing it to complain and getting reassurance that yes, it does get good, just wait a while longer. So I waited. And yawned. And took screenshots of pretty scenery to pass the time. &gt;!Anyone else thought Vader pretty much lives in Mordor?!&lt;
  
([These guys](https://otherworldsreviews.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/red-robes.png), for example. I like red robes, okay? &gt;!There was even another 2 second cameo of the proper red guards.!&lt;)
  
Luckily, it did get better. Once shit finally started getting real and the pacing picked up, it was one hell of a ride. But it was mostly saved by finally developing a plot, not because the characters improved. I can’t help but wonder how good it could have been if we were able to form an emotional attachment to the characters in the first half. How much harder would some of the emotional moments hit? How much better would it be if I didn’t spend an hour and a half yawning and waiting for it to get good? It’s so close to being a genuinely great movie, potentially the best of the bunch, that its flaws are all the more infuriating.

Disappointing.

#Solo (2018)
I went into *Solo* very cautiously. Han Solo was one of my least favourite characters in the original trilogy and besides, it’s a known flop.

After watching it, I have to say it doesn’t deserve half the shit it gets because it was fucking *delightful*. I was grinning nearly the whole way through and it left me absolutely pumped. It’s a fast-paced bundle of fun, and actors being different did not bother me much at all. In short, the complete opposite of *Rogue One*.

The thing I loved the most is that, exactly like *The Mandalorian*, *Solo* shows us the gritty underside of the Empire we don’t get to see in the main series. There are no Jedi, or big damn heroes this time around, it’s more morally gray and focused on people with no special destiny. Very much up my alley. My favourite example of this is the ~~airport~~ spaceport scene near the beginning. The background detail and the atmosphere it creates are astonishing – the PA announcements, Imperial propaganda, casual Stormtrooper brutality, the grime, the long waitlines. And there are many more scenes like it. &gt;!Trench warfare, terrible conditions on mining planets...not the kind of stuff I expected to see in Star Wars, but hey.!&lt; Instead of just telling us that the Empire is evil, it makes some effort to *show* us why, more effectively than any of the main movies did. Even in an unabashedly popcorn movie, this is more than welcome.

And then there are all the other goodies that make it as wonderfully entertaining as it is. Spaceships! Criminals! The galaxy’s filthy underworld! Fun twists! It might be grittier than the main series, but it’s no less fun. And unlike in *Rogue One*, the characters had some actual…well, character. Even the mandatory sassy droid was more fun.

Of course it’s not perfect. Some actors’ delivery of lines is *incredibly* awkward at points, for one. And I wasn’t a fan of how L3 was handled at all either – without going into spoilers, they did her so dirty. Qi’ra confused me. But all in all, none of the flaws was enough to torpedo me out of the story. It had more pros than cons. *It made sense.*

#Verdict
The end impression is bittersweet.

They’re both fairly similar in some ways – both of them attempt to show a grittier, somewhat more morally gray side of the galaxy compared to the relatively straightforward dark side vs. light side conflict of the main series. Both focus almost entirely on non-Jedi. Both are standalone. Both are flawed.

But *Solo* worked for me enough to put it in the second tier with *The Force Awakens* and most of the original trilogy - and *Rogue One* didn’t, not really. There are two things I watch Star Wars for: the pew pews, and the fun characters (and the worldbuilding, but that’s a given in any movie), and the former is only fun when the latter’s there. Action is meaningless without emotional connection. It’s a similar problem as I had with *The Rise of the Skywalker*, except that was a mess beyond any hope of salvation and *Rogue One* comes frustratingly close to being excellent.

Since I’m done with the movies, this is probably the last post in this series. It’s been one hell of a ride – from someone who has stubbornly avoided them and only reluctantly started watching because of an adorable baby alien, to a massive fan who practically won’t shut up. I apologise to everyone waiting for book reviews and generally more diverse kinds of content while I’m getting Star Wars out of my system – which may as well take months. If nothing else, it pulled me out of a really bad depressive funk and for that I will always be grateful 😄

Now, onto *Clone Wars*, *Rebels*, and the books!

*More reviews on my blog, [To Other Worlds](https://otherworldsreviews.wordpress.com).*",1
150,"Goodreads Librarians are deleting ongoing web serials with 100s of reviewsLike many people, I enjoy a good web serial. I think they're a great addition to the literary world and while they often have an air of uncertainty about being dropped, I enjoy them. Serials are, of course, nothing new. Many famous authors got their start writing serial works.

Unfortunately, the librarians at Goodreads feel that ongoing web serials are not books. And that, subsequently, they do not belong on the site. I could find nowhere in the librarian rules that this is an invalid format for Goodreads and have received no word as to the justification.

I just wanted to let people know because this feels like an injustice to readers. As it is the readers that are hurt most by this. Goodreads is first and foremost a social media platform for readers. It's a shame that this is happening.

**Full Disclosure:** This all came about because I was attempting to add my serial to Goodreads. As so many have done before me. Seeing that no rule stated web serials were not allowed, I thought it was fine. 

When I contacted the librarians to add a URL to my book like how Worm and many others have it, my listing was deleted and the reason given was that ongoing web serials are not considered valid on Goodreads.

I thought this was a category error and I should have listed it as a serial or something else more appropriate. I linked two very popular serials pointing out that they are on the site and if I have the wrong category to point me in the right direction.

The librarian stated that they can't be held responsible for people posting books, but that they will remove them as soon as they notice them if they are in violation. 

My use of popular and well-established titles was to help legitimize and show that there is indeed a precedent, serials should be allowed, and that there are no rules against their inclusion evidenced by several titles being up for years.

What happened was the librarian deleted the two linked books. These are the books deleted:

 [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36013957-the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36013957-the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound) 

 [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081167-mother-of-learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081167-mother-of-learning) 

As you can see, both are now gone. I sincerely apologize for any damage done. It was in no way, shape, or form, my intention to see harm to another author's hard work. I was attempting to use such high-profile titles as a means of strengthening the case for the inclusion of web serials.

This isn't how the system should work.",1
151,"Question about Audible vs Kindle (Whispersync)Trying to wrap my head around Kindle pairing with audible.  I have an audible subscription, but I read far more than 12 books a year so I often end up buying books additional.  I tend to read it first, then if I want a second read I will listen to the narration.  Some books I like to read and listen to, such a wheel of time, because the narration is phenomenal.  

&amp;#x200B;

The question...If I go to audible, and look at Eye of the World (Wheel of Time book 1) it costs $41.97.  The kindle website has the written book listed as $10.99, and you can pay $7.49 for whispersync with voice bringing the total to $18.48.  Is whispersync not the same narration (Michael Kramer/Kate Reading) or something? 

&amp;#x200B;

I already own physical copies of the WoT series, but unless I am missing something it looks like Audible is cool if you use your credits, but otherwise you are paying 3x as much for the the narration compared to kindle where you get both the narration and a digital book.",1
152,"Memory Thieves – an emerging subgenre of fantasyFantasy is now so extensive a genre, you could go years without reading another in the same subcategory. That’s why it seems strange when two books with a similar idea are published at the same time, but it can also be incredibly exciting when you realise that an entirely new subgenre is beginning to emerge, one that you were there to witness the birth of.

We’re at that frontier now with the ‘memory thief’ subgenre, where people can steal memories from others, leaving their victim bereft of experiences, emotions and even their identity. In the process, the thief gains a wealth of knowledge, which they can use or disregard as they please. This new type of magic system is a fascinating foray into the unknown, but it rivals real world issues we increasingly face.

The rise of the subgenre may be linked to a growing awareness of mental health, but although the theme of identity is nothing new, what is arguably more interesting is how the authors at the forefront of this subgenre explore the frontier in very different ways. To fully understand what I mean, you’ll have to read Incendiary by Zoraida Cordova and Last Memoria by Rachel Emma Shaw. Both are fantastic books in their own rights (definitely worth a read!), but it’s only by reading the two together that you get an insight into how one idea can vary so much in how an author tells it.

An idea alone means nothing, it’s the author’s experiences, interests and attitude to life that create the story. This becomes very apparent with Incendiary and Last Memoria. They explore different aspects of memory thieving: consequences of memory loss, imbalance of power, how mistrust and suspicion can replace trust and affection, but do so in a way that creates different tones to the worlds.

Take Incendiary, the more YA of the two. The book introduces us to our memory thieving protagonist, Ren, in a way that implies a hopefulness for her adventures to come.

*“I am Renata Convida. I have lived a hundred stolen lives. Now I live my own.”*

She’s on a mission to rescue her people from the kingdom that hates them. This is a character who has faced much, yet still has a youthful determination to make the most of life.

Then we have Last Memoria, a much grittier, more adult and potentially realistic take on memory stealing. Here we see the strain put on the thief’s relationships with others and themselves.

*“Sarilla had learnt one thing from stealing memories. Everybody lies.”*

This more brutalist outlook results in a protagonist who cannot be good, but who sees herself as no less of a monster than those she stole from.

Despite all the differences between the books, there are interesting ways the authors are aligned. Both do an impressive job of worldbuilding and both explore the consequences of hatred for memory thieves. In Last Memoria, Sarilla is forced to steal by a king who recognises the power she can bring him, and she’s despised for it. The same is somewhat true for Ren and her kind in Incendiary, but with different consequences.

Both authors have recognised the importance of memories, then based this at the heart of their stories, particularly in the case of Last Memoria, where the memory stealing is used to great effect in several unexpected ways. Though I’ll say no more since I don’t want to ruin it for you.

Incendiary and Last Memoria are due for release in the spring and I highly recommend you add both books to your to-read list. If you do, you’ll get two heartbreakingly beautiful stories that will leave you reeling and so glad you discovered this new subgenre.

Thanks for reading my review",1
153,"The Night Angel Trilogy: are they good books, or just angsty pulp?I'm looking for my next thing to read, and thought about giving these books a try, but I have reservations. I've seen people say they like them, and I know they were pretty successful, but I see a plot about assassins, slums, and a Black Dragon Guild and wonder ""is this just going to be an angsty, grimdark power fantasy?"" Are they actually good books, or more in the realm of pulpy adventure? I'm down with the grimdark thing if they're smartly written with good characters, but not if it's just lazy badassery.

Mind you, I have no grudge against pulpy angst-porn -- I probably would have loved that 20 years ago. Nowadays, it's not my thing. For some reference: I usually steer more toward stuff like the Broken Earth trilogy, the Magicians trilogy, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, Neil Gaiman's stuff, just finished the Winternight books, stuff like that, but wouldn't mind a decent action-oriented series as a change of pace. I'm down with stuff like SoI&amp;F, really didn't like the Mistborn books, and was lukewarm on The First Law trilogy (didn't love it, but I do think it's well-written).

I looked at The Powder Mage Trilogy as well, but got the impression the Night Angel books were better received.",1
154,"Review: Onslaught of Madness by Jesse TellerWow. What a story. Intense, dark and brooding. Grittiness turned up to the max. This is the second novel I’ve read from Jesse Teller and he definitely has a style that skilfully sucks the reader into his intricately imagined world and shows them no mercy once they’re there. ​

I was swept up in the distinctive multiple narratives, compelled to keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. I quickly realised my enjoyment of this novel heightened when I read in long gulps of a couple of hours or so at a time, rather than in little sips, to get the full immersive experience. 
 
The story follows the invasion of the country of Tienne by the brutal country of Drine. Drine culture is essentially a war factory, with children taught to fight and kill from the time they can toddle. Women are baby makers from the moment they can bear children and slaves are captured to become more soldiers or mothers. They follow the god of destruction, Dis. Dis wants Tienne and sends his trusted warlord, Rextur Cherlot, otherwise known as the Madness of Drine, to crush it. 
 
Rextur seems unstoppable, carrying the Scythe of Dis and riding on Dis’ great bull. But mighty Rextur's grand invasion plans come unstuck as the country of Tienne proves not to be such an easy target. Unlikely heroes step up to fight back, other Gods grant followers great powers and skilled swordsmen unite.
 
To maintain his power, Rextur captures his foe. But instead of making things better for him, they make them much, much worse. Moons shatter, cities crumble and blood is shed. For all his strength and divine magic, the Madness of Drine falters…
 
The story is also told from the point of views of those who are fighting back against Rextur. There’s Aaron the Marked, who follows his magical King Chief along with another, who have come down from the mountains to resist. The trio are all boys, although where they’re from, they are men. They’re skilled fighters and strategists. Bent on following his King’s orders, Aaron has to deal with the pesky annoyance of his dead father’s voice in his head telling him otherwise. 
 
Tera is a young woman who is chosen by her god, the god of children, to find the new ‘Perpetual Child’ and save the Tienne children captured by Drine from being taken back to feed Drine’s war machine. For company and guidance, she has a magical wooden horse who speaks, and joins forces with a ‘pack’ of human/animals who follow another god, the Mother of Nature, but who also want to stop Rextur.
 
Vianne is a witch of high status who is forced into protecting her betrothed’s city after her own is invaded. She has troubles with her drunk brother and his scheming friend. There’s also Sai the swordsmen, and a treacherous mage, Arundis. 
 
There’s plenty of action, deep worldbuilding and the writing is evocative with powerful imagery. I particularly liked this line: “The streets filled quickly with soldiers as Drine’s sons tore into the city of Eleacont like fangs into tender meat.” SO RAW!
 
This book took a few chapters to get into, to really get under the skin of each of the narrative characters, but once I was firmly ensconced there, it was an emotional, fast-paced ride. Also, one of the character’s narratives abruptly ends and is replaced by that of their murderer. I was hoping that the character would reappear in a kind of “Ta da, magic, I’m baaaaack!” way, but unfortunately not, and they were shaping up to be my favourite.
 
Onslaught of Madness is a grimdark fantasy that will appeal to those who love carefully created worlds with multi-layered histories, a large cast of complex characters, stories told from multiple POVs and bloody, unrelenting action. 
 
My rating: 4.5/5",1
155,"Fantasy stories with big technological gapLooking for fantasy stories with big technological gap in any medium. Something like guns vs swords and magic, industrialization in fantasy world, civilization with very advanced magic etc.. I'm craving for it.

I've only read/watched asian fantasies but I'm also looking for western fantasy stories in any medium except games. I'm kinda getting tired Japanese isekais now.

Things I've read/watched with technological gap:

GATE: Thus the JSDF fought (JP) – Gate to a medieval fantasy world opened in Japan. Japan Self Defense Force fought empires, kingdom alliance, dragons, demigods, monsters using modern weapons. Lots of Japanese patriotism.

Release that Witch (CN) – MC, an industrial engineer from modern world, transmigrated as a 4th prince of a kingdom in a medieval fantasy world where witches are being hunted by the religion and kingdoms. He starts an industrial revolution using witches' power. Lots of political schemes and conspiracies.

The Book Eating Magician (KR) – There's two superpower countries that have been fighting each other for hundreds of years. One is the most technologically advanced kingdom which is the MC's country and the other is one is an empire with best swordsmen which are basically anti-mages. Their wars are like US vs Soviet back in the cold wars.

The Starship Officer Becomes An Adventurer (JP) – Sci-Fi soldier's starship crashes in a sword and magic fantasy world. He starts adventuring this world with his sci-fi weapons.

Manuke FPS (JP) - Virtual Reality FPS player falls into an out of bounds place in the game and got transported in a sword and magic fantasy world.

156,"Insufficiently Whiny ProtagonistsA lot of people complain about excessively whiny protagonists.  I have the opposite problems.  A lot of Fantasy with literary pretentions will have a character experience things they consider unjust, then the story will whack them upsides the head and show them their parent/mentor had reasons and should be forgiven.  The problem is, they often dial things up to 11 to the point it reads as abuse to me. to the point that ""forgiving"" the parental figure feels like Stocklholm Syndrome or Authorial Gaslighting to me.

Something similar happens in ""Pride &amp; Prejudice"" or ""Alphahole"" romances.  Often the protagonist will start out angry for totally justified reasons then end up forgiving the love interest for something I see as unforgiveable.

Anyone else notice this phenomenon?  Can you think of books where the protagonist forgave the unforgiveable?  Where a straight out case of child abuse was treated as something the hero would understand when he got older?",1
157,"Tracking new books and read?Sorry, I'm a casual fantasy reader, so I'm not familiar with the community, but I wanted to know if there's a website that I can use to track books I've read, or want to read AND more importantly, will let me know if a new book in that series comes out without checking.

Like, if the next Game of Thrones book wasn't as popular that I would see it everywhere, I'd get an e-mail that the book was released as I follow the series. Something like that.

He makes all the decisions either because she doesn't care to get involved in any decision making or because she's afraid to confront him. After all the bad things that happened to her in the first book (she seemed to spend a lot of time sleeping), she still isn't especially motivated to take control of her power or life. She's just along for the ride doing whatever Matthew feels is best. Overall I'm enjoying the series but she just seems like a very weak character.",1
159,"Read What You Already Own: Four Mini Reviews[Part 1 and ""the rules""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/enrrqn/read_what_you_already_own_2020_two_mini_reviews/)

I've cleared four more things off my Kobo/Audible account. Four more and I'm allowed to buy a new book :D

First, a couple of DNFs:  


**Breath of Earth** by Beto Cato

I was warned that I might not like it, and yeah, I struggled to get into this before finally deleting it. Any US history - including alt history - has a massive hill to climb with me, and American-setting steampunk has a massive hill to climb with me. So...combining those two and, well, I'm definitely not the target reader for this. Not sure when I bought this or why; I've liked some of Beth's short stories in the past, so it might have been a whim or there was a sale. 

**Downbelow Station** by CJ Cherryh

Yes, this was a DNF. No, I have no idea why not. Yes, I understand that I've never DNF a Cherryh book before. No, I have actually read another book in this series and liked it. But after 50 pages, I. was. bored. And, no, it wasn't that I didn't know what was going on because I've read Merchanter's Luck. And, no, it wasn't her style. I've read the entire Foreigner series. I just...bounced...hard. So that was disappointing because I remember this ebook costing a small fortune. But alas. 

Stuff I finished:

**The Magpie Lord** and **Interlude with Tattoos** by KJ Charles

If it wasn't for the sex scene (singular), I'd have planned to read this entire series. That's how much I hated the sex scene. But, I thought well maybe it was just that one, and went ahead with the short story that happens right after this book, and ho boi no, I really hate these sex scenes. And, since the sex scene submission language was showing up randomly in the short story, I decided that I wouldn't even be able to just skip the sex scenes later on. I loathe reading this kind of ""kink"", for lack of a better way to describe it. I'm rather disappointed, honestly, because the writing and story itself was excellent. 

**The Adventures of Myhr** by PN Elrod

A fun story for when you need a shorter, laid-back book that's standalone. The middle sagged a little for me, but not enough to stop reading (I think this was mostly due to the length; this would have been a perfect book if it was about 75 pages shorter, but it's a trad book from 2003; it was going to be 350-400 pages no matter what the story actually needed). Basic plot is two dudes were portal jumping around the universe, accidentally ended up in the wrong place, shit was going down, they couldn't jump out, they got involved with the shit, and then there was a few accidentally trips to hell in the process. 

**What else is on the Kobo?** 

Well, hundreds of books. Here's some titles I'm picking from next. Feel free to share thoughts on it you think I'll like them or not.

We walk its public and corporate spaces through the first-person POVs of four people. Kendra is an art school dropout who just got ""sponsored"" by a mega-corp to become a walking soft drink advertisement and addict in exchange for healing nanobots and fame.  Toby is running a real-time podcast of his life, which occasionally involves all sorts of illegal activities. Tendeka runs various charity projects and organizes anti-government protest actions on the side (which Toby films and broadcasts) on behalf of some mysterious entity called skyward* (take *that*, Brandon Sanderson).  Lerato is computer prodigy working for a BIG CORPORATION, who is hacking things on the side.  One day Toby spots Kendra's glowing soft drink tattoo, and makes Lerato help Tendeka screw with corporate advertising boards on the highway, and things quickly go downhill from there.

**Thoughts:** quick fast-paced read - very much *unlike* **The Shining Girls**, which I started dreading once I realized where things were going.  Unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately - it falls into the category of books that perhaps were written as a cautionary tale, but are essentially becoming less and less science fiction and more and more documentaries with every day.  We are not at the same level of genetic engineering, but there are countries in the world that are exactly that the same level of policing, and there are corporations in the world that are exactly at the same level of &gt;!creating false flag operations!&lt; when it suits their needs.  And it is seriously depressing.

Also, without commenting on the plot points that make me say so, Tendeka is a tool who got played by such an obvious set-up.  Although, come to think of it, the novel really is about how every protagonist is essentially a naive tool of those who know which buttons to push, with only the least likely of them retaining any semblance of free will at the end.

**Content warnings** Not much. Sex scenes are sort of sexless.  Everyone is doing drugs - this seems to be a thing with near future dystopias in general.  Lots of bodily fluids at the end of the book, so if reading about constant vomiting is not your thing, watch out.  But really, nothing major.

**Who will like it:** Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross fans.  In various ways, **Moxyland** is an anti-thesis to **Little Brother**. Both probably should be read in quick succession, with **Little Brother** being second in order to restore one's faith in humanity.

**Who will not like it:**  Two groups of people, I think. First, those who do not like idiot ball. Because Tendeka turns out to be all about it in the most sincere way possible.  Second - anarchists, and any other supporters of indiscriminate violence as a response to totalitarian regimes. Because the point of the book is that **these people** are the most likely ones to be played. And if you are sincere in your beliefs, you probably won't like it as the book's core message

**Rating**: **C-list** fair and square.  Solid, if depressing book, but nothing in it that aggressively stands out above the fray.

161,"I am Sever Bronny, author of The Arinthian Line series and Fury of a Rising Dragon series - AMA!Hiyas!

I'm the r/fantasy Writer of the Day, here to answer all your questions regarding my work.

I've been a full-time author for over four years and write coming-of-age fantasy that can be read by all ages. I've published 1.48 million words spread over eight books (two series), all having to do with the same three characters (a teenage boy and two girls: Augum, Bridget and Leera). I write from a single point of view (Augum's) and painstakingly complete about one book a year. My latest book, *Mercy's Trial (Fury of a Rising Dragon, book 3)*, took over a year and a half to complete and launched in December.

I started reading fantasy at a young age, beginning with the Dragonlance saga, and continuing on with the usual favorites (LOTR, etc). I role-played a lot (Rifts, Palladium, AD&amp;D, Gurps, Vampire, among others), and was an avid gamer, particularly getting caught up in the Diablo universe. Nowadays I relax by playing games like BOTW and Skyrim. I love reading and movies (I regularly re-watch Bladerunner, Star Wars, Highlander, Aliens, Limitless, Edge of Tomorrow, Interstellar, Lost in Translation, and Margin Call. Must have seen Bladerunner nearly a hundred times). My absolute favorite books to read, besides fantasy, are non-fiction true-lie survival tales (stuff like Krakauer's *Into Thin Air*, Kurson's *Shadow Divers*, and Junger's *Perfect Storm*).

I started writing fantasy after about my fourth or fifth read-through of Harry Potter, at which point I was so desperate to read a story that made me *feel* the way HP had made me feel—that sheer excitement and sense of friendship and adventure and mystery—that I simply started writing one. 

I never looked back.

I'm also a failed musician who has been given a second chance at a creative profession (backstory to that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5ot1tm/four_years_five_books_867000_words_its_not_every/dcltws6/)), and am extremely grateful to be writing for my day job in a notoriously fickle industry. On average, I write about 2000+ words a day and love every minute of it (well, most of the time). I cannot thank my readers enough for supporting my work.

**What critics say about my work:** The early stuff is overly simple, youngish, and derivative. Some are repulsed by the occasional teenage drama, others can't stand the political biases which I've occasionally allowed to bleed into the work.

**What fans say about my work:** That I've developed my own unique magic system, that my characters are lovable and evolve over time, that they love my worldbuilding, and that they've enjoyed seeing my progression as an author. They compare my work to a mix of Harry Potter/The Hobbit/Eragon, though say it has quickly evolved into its own unique thing. Oh and some readers have labeled my work ""Progression Fantasy,"" which is interesting, but I believe relevant.

[Here's an overly staged photo of me](https://i.imgur.com/upPlnbU.jpg) for this AMA.

162,"Elric Series Audiobooks?This is not the first time this has been brought up over the years. 2 exist (EoM, SotSoF, #1,#2)  but essentially unobtainable.

I am so desperate to get the WHOLE series on audiobook. My eyesight has degenerated and I rely on audio to enjoy the books I love and pass the time. These particular books, I grew up with and have heavily internalized, and it tortures me I cannot enjoy them.

I tried TTS, but even Googles new tech just cannot do dramatic reading.

Is there some motivated fan (preferably British) who would consider narrating these books, ala Gareth Armstrong, WH40k books, and sharing? If I had the money I would pay a pro, maybe a crowd fund? Is there anyone out there as frustrated as I am? What should I do?

In particular:

 Elric of Menibone

The Sailor on the Seas of Fate

The Weird of the White Wolf

The Bane of the Black Sword

164,"Future teacher trying to track down the title and author of a fantasy short story that I loved - does this plot sound familiar?My google-fu isn't working for me, so I thought I'd de-lurk and ask for help. This is a long shot, but I'm crossing my fingers. 

Several years ago I read a short story in a fantasy collection that I thought was particularly haunting - I remember looking up other works by the same author because I was so impressed. Unfortunately, my menopausal brain has not been helpful in bringing the author and title back to mind now. 

The short story was set *after* your typical high fantasy series, where a queen fights in the night, year after year, to save her husband the king from his nightmares and hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. The basic premise is that he did the typical heroic things we read about in epic fantasy, but she is a quiet hero of a different kind, who saves him again and again from the fallout  of battling the Big Evil. 

It was a beautiful story that has stayed with me for years and I'd like to track it down again. I'm about to start my last practicum before becoming a high school English teacher and this would be a great story to include in the short story unit. 

On a side note: I'm dismayed to discover how little has changed in terms of resources since I was in high school myself. Don't get me wrong, I love Edgar Allan Poe and Ray Bradbury and Shirley Jackson, but it's like the short story textbooks are stuck in a time warp.",1
165,"Progression Fantasy Super-Sale!If you're not familiar with it yet, progression fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that follows characters as they develop in power and skill over time. It's obviously been around for quite a while, but was only recently named and taxonomized by the amazing Andrew Rowe, author of Arcane Ascension. There's a massive range of variance in the subgenre- works as diverse as Dragon Ball Z, Tamora Pierce's Protector of the Small, and Jim Butcher's Codex Alera could all be considered progression fantasy.

I have heard it semi-jokingly referred to as stories for people who have an unusual love of training montages, and, well... hard to argue with that one.

A few of us self-identified progression fantasy authors decided to run a progression fantasy sale starting today, so, without further ado:

* Andrew Rowe's [Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3): Years ago, Corin Cadence's brother ventured into the Serpent Spire Trials to earn an attunement to grant him magical power. He never came back. Now it's Corin's turn, and he's going to do whatever it takes to find his brother. If you like wizard schools, complex hard magic systems, dungeon crawls, and lots of JRPG-influences, Sufficiently Advanced Magic is most definitely up your alley. (And, for those of us who love enchanting and magitech, oh do we get so much of that.) [UK Sale Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)
* Will Wight's [House of Blades (Traveler's Gate Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D52X58Y?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks): When Simon's village is destroyed, a prophecy foretells that a hero will arise among the survivors to save the realm. The only problem is that the hero in question isn't Simon. That's not going to stop him from trying to save his fellow villagers anyways. If you like hard magic systems with unusual costs and dangerous temptations, fast paced action, and gratuitously huge swords, you should give House of Blades a look. (And, because Will Wight's just cooler than the rest of us, this one's free! Will's also the author of the amazing Cradle series.)
* Sarah Lin's [Street Cultivation](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Cultivation-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B07W9J75R3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) and [Changing Faces (NGM Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KMMT9TX?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks): Rick is an employee of a strip mall training dojo, just trying to make enough money to get by and take care of his sister. Unfortunately, when he's caught up in an underground fighting tournament, he finds himself in well over his head. Street Cultivation is one of my favorite takes on the xianxia-inspired cultivation genre. Like Cradle, it has a martial arts magic system that literally everyone in the world has access to. Street Cultivation, however, takes that into the urban fantasy realm, where predatory debt, lawyers, and gentrification are as bigger threats than demons or rogue martial artists. (The demons, after all, have some very nice offices downtown, and are quite the respectable businessmen these days.) Changing Faces is the first book of Sarah Lin's New Game Minus LitRPG series. The dread necromancer Bloodwraith, on the edge of defeat, trades bodies with the adventurer that defeated him. He suddenly finds himself trapped in a brutish warrior's body, confronting the revelation that mysterious alien gods have been manipulating his world for their own strange purposes. Worse, there are mysterious floating boxes full of text constantly obscuring his vision. If you're a fan of emotionally well-developed characters and masterful trope subversions, you should give Sarah Lin a read!

Another cultivation series like Street Cultivation or Cradle, A Thousand Li stands out for its heavy grounding in Medieval Chinese history and culture. There are even footnotes explaining various Chinese concepts and references, which I absolutely adore. (Terry Pratchett trained me to love footnotes in fiction, what can I say? Footnotes make everything better.) Great for fans of Wuxia (Legend of the Condor Heroes; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and fans of slice-of-life fantasy. [UK Sale Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07PKGSDDQ/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_1)
* Last and least (seriously, read the others first, they're all so much fun), we've got my own Mage Errant series. [Into the Labyrinth (Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J675X2C?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks) and [Jewel of the Endless Erg (Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJDV4JJ?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_1&amp;storeType=ebooks) are on sale now. Hugh of Emblin is, as far as he's concerned, the worst mage at the Academy of Skyhold, and would be entirely happy avoiding everyone's attention. Anonymity, however, isn't in the cards for Hugh, and he quickly finds himself caught up in situations beyond his control after a mysterious mage chooses him as an apprentice. If you're a fan of excessively convoluted hard magic systems, Machiavellian political intrigue, giant monsters, and emotional trainwreck protagonists, you might... not hate Mage Errant. (That's about as nice as my impostor syndrome is feeling towards me today.)

167,"Review and unqualified recommendation: Sleepless DomainIt just occurred to me that I haven't seen any mention of [Sleepless Domain](http://www.sleeplessdomain.com/comic/chapter-1-cover) on this subreddit and a quick search finds nothing, so allow me to rectify that with a review of this fantastic webcomic. 

Sleepless Domain is a magical girl webcomic set in a city where monsters attack every night like clockwork. There is no masquerade here, magical girls are an institution. They have government support, school hours start late so they can sleep in after battling monsters, there are databses of costumes and magical symbols to help magical girls quickly find their destined team; and there's also big money for the aspiring magical girl in adverts and celebrity endorsements. In short the entire culture has accepted and normalised the idea that pre-teen girls are the city's entire military force. 

Despite that this is not another Madoka like deconstruction of the magical girl genre. The book never shies away from the implications of putting the responsibility of fighting monsters onto young girls - even if the citizens take it for granted - but the focus is on why these girls fight and the emotional strength and resilience they demonstrate in doing so. They are never portrayed as wrong for wanting to fight, and they're never portrayed as wrong if they don't want to fight either.

That strength and resilience is probably the comic's best selling point. The main characters are wonderful three dimensional characters and it's an absolute joy to read about their friendship, how they give each other emotional support, and help each other be the very best they can be. Though on a personal level I'm also very keen on the slow burn (perhaps too slow burn) mystery connected to the origins of magical girls and the city they live in.",1
168,"Book Review: Strange Grace by Tessa Gratton 

### Summary:

*Long ago, a village made a bargain  with the devil: to ensure their prosperity, when the Slaughter Moon  rises, the village must sacrifice a young man into the depths of the  Devil’s Forest.*

*Only this year, the Slaughter Moon has risen early.*

*Bound by duty, secrets, and the love  they share for one another, Mairwen, a spirited witch; Rhun, the  expected saint; and Arthur, a restless outcast, will each have a role to  play as the devil demands a body to fill the bargain. But the devil  these friends find is not the one they expect, and the lies they uncover  will turn their town—and their hearts—inside out.*

[**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32824058-strange-grace)

### Thoughts:

Here we go with my usual refrain of ‘this  was such a weird book and I totally loved it’. I loved the characters,  the writing style was my type of thing, and there was weird stuff  happening which I can almost always get behind.

This is sort of a dark fantasy about a  village where everyone is healthy and the crops never fail due to a deal  made with ‘the devil’, a strange creature that inhabits the surrounding  woods, many generations ago. Every seven years a young man from the  village will be selected as the sacrifice, or what they call ‘the  saint’, to be taken by ‘the devil’ and fulfill the agreement. ‘The  saint’ is the best of their generation, chosen because they are good  person, which makes sense as far as sacrifices go. No one really knows  what happens to those saints, except every once in a while one will live  through the night and return to the village. No one really knows why  some come back and some don’t but being ‘the saint’ is generally  considered to be a death sentence. So now we come to present day. It’s  not yet time for another saint, the seven years aren’t up, but suddenly  people are getting sick, there is blight on the crops, people start  panicking and decide that they need to offer up another saint now,  before things get worse. And that’s where our story begins.

There’s something very fae and old magic  about this story. It’s like a fairy tale but the original  pre-bowlderized kind that are dark and full of weird creatures who like  to make dangerous bargains. There is a lore here about the village and  why this pact came to be but it’s been so long (a couple of hundred  years, maybe?) and the story has shifted over time and some parts have  either been forgotten or deliberately obscured. Our characters, all  having to play a part in this ritual, are desperate to find out the  truth and if there’s a way out of the pact or a way to preserve it  without one of them disappearing forever. So there’s a lot of mystery  going on and the way that mystery is uncovered is interesting in the  story because it’s interwoven with other things that are going on.

Nothing in this is straight forward. It’s  dark and twisted and someone described it to me as a fever dream and I  think that fits perfectly well. It’s like there’s a haze at times you’re  trying to see through but you can only see some things even though you  know there’s more out there. This is mainly due to the style of prose  where very limited information is imparted to the reader leaving us with  a lot of blanks to fill in. This happens to be one of my favorite  techniques when it is done well and I think it works out here for the  most part although maybe there were a couple of instances where it could  have been done a little bit better. The style of storytelling was a  huge plus for me with this one because it creates such a wonderful  atmosphere–gothic like in a earthy way.

Our three main characters were fantastic.  First we have Mairwen, who is going to be inheriting her mother’s  position as the village grace witch, a position going back to before the  original bargain was made. Some people fear her strangeness but her and  her mother’s place in the village is respected nonetheless. Then you  have Arthur, who was raised as a girl for the first eight or ten years  of his life because his mother was afraid of losing him as a saint. He’s  angry a lot and has a ton of issues and hang ups because of his  upbringing and his parents in general. He is someone that needs a lot of  love, starting with self-love. Last but not least is Rune. He’s the  perfect boy, the obvious saint. He’s nice and helpful and everyone loves  him. The three of them have been friends since children and they have a  complicated history. I don’t want to go into too much because I don’t  want to spoil the story but there is a lot of angst involved in all  their relationships with one another, a lot of want and need and love in  the face of ‘probably shouldn’t’ and ‘this isn’t a good idea’ and the  ever present ‘what will people say’. One of the most satisfying things  about the book was the way their relationship plays out over the course  of the story.

The other thing that is interesting about  this book is the scale of the story. It’s got huge stakes for the folks  involved, and even for the entire village, but it’s definitely on the  smaller scale of things where fantasy is concerned. I really appreciated  that this wasn’t another huge epic fantasy, because I like more  personal stories! Also, the entire book takes place over a pretty short  period of time (a few days I think, maybe a week). Yet I was never  bored, there are plenty of things at play here with the strands of  different narratives woven together as they are.

Overall, I really loved this one. In the  end I wished that it had gone on a bit longer because I wish I could  spend more time with these characters in the aftermath of everything  that happened. I don’t suppose that’s a flaw though, only a ‘me’ thing  of wanting more. **4/5 stars.**",1
169,"Suggestions for First-Person Narrators?I really appreciate how easy it is to follow along in stories that are told from the first-person perspective. If I'm driving and have the audio book going, it's simple enough to get back on the rails if my mind starts to wander when the main character is doing the narration.

I've finished Dresden Files, Alex Verus and Iron Druid (among many other non-FPN books). I loved them, and am open to most any fantasy/sci-fi that's as easy to listen to.",1
170,"Magic systemsI'm struggling with this concept. I'd love it if you could recommend something? The best i'm able to think about is harnessing energy from a common source and using magic spells, names for different spells.",1
171,"Which books/series had an excellent premise but did not deliver on the execution of the story?I recently finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman and it left me a little cold. I was so hyped for it - I love the Sandman graphic novels and the premise of international gods escaping to America sounded so cool. But the actual narrative was kind of dull and underwhelming. Gaiman's writing is excellent but the plot never really picked up and the characters, especially Shadow, were fairly uninteresting.

What are some other fantasy novels that you felt had an amazing premise but weren't able to deliver on it?",1
172,"What's a good way to see if a series is finished?I only like to read a series if the last book is either already out or should be out by the time I'm up to it. I almost started reading what I thought was a trilogy this week but ended up seeing a comment here that it's actually a four-book series. I get scared to check most sites because I don't want to see spoilers. Is there an easy, spoiler-free way to see if a series is complete? Thanks in advance!",1
173,"**The Killing Moon** by NK Jemisin main plot points/summary?I’m about to start reading **The Shadowed Sun** and want a refresher for the first book in the Duology (been a couple years). Can’t seem to find much via google searches. Anyone got something they can point me to or feel like recounting it for me if it’s fresh? I remember the setup/word and most of the main characters, just can’t remember some of the major plot points from the second half of the book.",1
174,"I miss the discovery of fantasyIt's not all that fantastical anymore. There's trolls, elves, magic, maybe a pinch of medieval, a touch of dragons and some mythical creatures. 

And the story's different, the plot's different, but that's almost all of what's different. This sounds like a very one-dimensional approach to fantasy, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at. 

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy fantasy, it just doesn't feel as refreshing, new and original. I mean, immerse me in a world of your creation, not something that came with a template. 

Anyone know any fantastical books that might tickle my fancy?",1

Tried to pick up Stormlight Archive due to its strong reviews...and of course...Book one of TEN! AND it takes 3-4 years for each volume to come out. So I guess I’ll finish the story sometime in 2038. 

After a few months of encountering nothing but series I gave up and turned to sci fi where I found tons of stand alone novels and finished series. 

What is with high fantasy and this obsession with multiple volumes? I literally can’t think of any other genre where the default is 9-10 volume series stretched out over 17-20 years. 

Anyone else dismayed at the fact that they can’t just read a high fantasy novel and move on instead of committing to the next 3-4 years to one series?",1
176,"You should probably play: Paper Mario and the Thousand Year DoorOkay hear me out.

When I was a kid, I didn't read Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit. I didn't play D&amp;D (though I knew what it was, vaguely). I didn't really have much of conception for goblins, elves, and all that. Oblivion had come out, and my brother played it, but all I remember of watching him play was him fighting ghosts in it.

No harry potter, no animorphs, just some goosebumps and other simple kid's books, y'know? But... I had a gamecube, and I sure as hell knew what mario was.

Enter the best game of the 2000's, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door.

It didn't set in me expectations of a genre of fantasy as something like Tolkien's work would do, no. It didn't tell me what elves had to be, what hobbits were, it didn't explain to me epic histories and lore and the kind of stuffiness that comes with high fantasy... it taught me how a world could be built from such disparite and silly assets into something meaningful and absolutely grand.

Paper Mario and the Thousand Door showed to me the real world of Mario, a place where goombas and koopas were just... there, living normal lives. Normal people. All these monsters of mario, they were just guys some times, and that was just wonderful. It's such lithe worldbuilding, literally just a few silly locations and scenarios, but opened up the playing field to this rich and wild planet where the Mushroom Kingdom was JUST a location, where everything Mario did was part of a larger world.  I didn't know the concept of ""those filthy orcs"" or ""The evil goblins"" I just knew that... Goombas could be normal people you could talk to and that's just how the world works.

It showed me the importance of primary characters over the world itself, then. The places were fantastic, well designed with fun plot lines with wonderful music and art. But Mario and his partners were so alive and full of character, just oozing with charm (to use a classic gamerism). This was the focus of the game, rather than a more straightforward story, we got various scenarios like episodes of a TV show with the characters supporting every act.

These heroes going on a quest to stop an ancient evil hidden in a great dungeon, acting to collect the various macguffins, fight dragons and- wait, what? Has this just turned into a fantasy RPG out of nowhere??? This is MARIO mama-mia papa pizza MARIO BROS. But there's so much to it! There's so much to gain of an understanding of fantasy from just this game. 

This was and IS the foundation of my understanding of fantasy as a genre, and what I build off of when I write and create. Weird as it may seem, if you haven't played it, you may just find use of it as another aspect in your repotoire...

besides it's just like a really good game to play, top notch turn based RPG honestly. 

Also Super Paper Mario is amazing, you just didn't get it.

Also play Steven Universe: Save the Light if you like TTYD, it's basically Paper Mario but with a steven universe coat of paint.

177,"Looking for a Small Unit Tactics Fantasy Battle SimulatorI'm looking for a way to simulate fantasy battles between small groups of mixed units for a project I'm working on, and was wondering if there were any games/websites where I could do this.

For example, let's say I wanted to simulate a fight between two pikemen, three swordsmen and an archer against five bandits armed with swords. The goal being to see how that would play out in different situations to study the tactics each side might use.

I know I could just pull out D&amp;D books, roll up characters, and then run it with pencil, paper, and dice on my tabletop, but I was wondering if there were any simulators available that might make the job quicker and easier. Heck, even ones where I have to manually order each unit in a turn-based situation is fine if I can choose the units and placement and the computer handles the combat.",1
178,"Blackwing - Book ReviewI usually like to present a balanced review that mentions the highs and lows of any particular book I read. But shucks…I just couldn’t fill out the cons side of the list. Allow me, instead, to gush. Blackwing was hands down my favorite read of 2019. What a world! It’s got hard-bitten characters, magic that is central to the story,  and a mystery that kept me guessing until the end. I loved this book. I. Loved. This. Book.

Blackwing tells the story of Ryhalt Galharrow and his increasingly desperate quest to save the Republic from an invasion by the Deep Kings, ancient inhuman sorcerers of near god-like power. He is a mercenary type, commanding a small group that hunts fugitives in the Misery, a no-man’s-land of magic gone awry that separate his nation from the Deep Kings. Galharrow serves one of the Nameless, his republic’s own inhuman sorcerers, pitted in a centuries old war against the Deep Kings.

Our protagonist, Ryhalt Galharrow, is a time honored hard drinking veteran/noir detective trope, that has his own quirks and backstory to differentiate him from other characters cast in this vein. When his long lost loved reenters the picture, his hope and nihilism take turns beating him over the head as he grapples with the hopelessness of his cause, and the reality that he serves a master every bit as selfish and inhuman as his enemy. The supporting cast is also colorful and unique. I wouldn’t say the novel has particularly deep characters, but each serves the story excellently. If there was one part of the book that didn’t quite click for me, it was the love story. It all made sense and read believably and kept things moving, but it didn’t evoke big feels.

The writing in Blackwing is excellent. It is clear and concise, but twisted through the lens of Galharrow’s black humor and cynicism. At every point it flows well, evoking character, and occasionally throwing in a little artistic flourish, or a wisecrack that brought a smirk to the corner of my mouth. Read this book.  Can’t be any clearer on that. It's a delight.

The setting is another huge selling point for this novel. The darlings and brides and drudges comprise a really cohesive and cool batch of baddies, humans warped by magic into monstrous abominations. The Deep Kings and the Nameless serve as great, epic level contending forces that make their appearances at key moments to ramp up the danger. Not to mention “the Misery”, a patch of land intentionally blighted by magic to ward off invasion. It all combines to create a unique flintlock fantasy with a dark twist.

Blackwing is the most promising first novel I have read in a very long time. I am 100% going to devour the rest of this trilogy in short order. Do yourself a favor and get on board. Five Stars.

I realized after I read through that thread that it's been years since I've read a book I considered ""hard"" that wasn't hard simply because I wasn't into it. Now I am inspired to ask: **What do you consider hard to read, and why? What does hard mean to you? Recommend me some puzzlers please!**


I'll start with two of the usual suspects: The Wizard Knight by Gene Wolfe and Latro in the Mist by Gene Wolfe.


I found it hard to grasp the significance of a lot of what was happening in the Wizard Knight because I wasn't great at discerning the symbolism and subtext. Was Able dying? What's with the twinning? How much time fuckery happening? 


Latro was difficult for me because of the narrator's amnesia. It was a lot of work for me to piece together what the action of certain scenes were from Latro's rather broken diary entries.",1

188,"Strange the Dreamer comes so close.. Does it hit or miss in your opinion?Edit: I meant to mention in the title, and now I can’t edit. Be warned, THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR STRANGE THE DREAMER.

I’m feeling so torn about Strange the Dreamer. I’m hoping someone out there feels similarly (or doesn’t, and can engage with me about their difference of opinion).

So many people talk about it as such a beautiful work of art. And I feel like it just... comes so close. But maybe misses the mark? Around the time of the never-ending dream make out session until the ending. Here’s my take: 

Very enjoyable, if a bit young adult-y. But that’s exactly what it is. Fascinating world and some wonderful characters that did not, however, get explored or fleshed out enough. 

The romance plot towards the end gets a bit much with the making out. It was sweet and romantic at first, and then a bit overdone, but then again, at 14 I would’ve enjoyed that aspect, and again, it’s YA. I much preferred their mutual adventures and deep and playful conversations to flesh out their romance, personally. I also did not love how Sarai needed continuous validation from Lazlo. It was VERY emo. I had to keep reminding myself it’s YA at this point, but I wouldn’t exactly want Sarai to be my daughter’s YA role model.. Lazlo also lost some personality here, his job seemingly being to continuously validate Sarai and try to solve her problems.

I did love the talk between Ruby and Sparrow at the end. It could’ve easily become a love triangle with the two girls at each other’s throats, but it ended in sisterly love and friendship instead, which was nice. Ruby’s jibe about it being a one-plum love was cute. 

I absolutely hate that it ended on a cliffhanger — I would’ve preferred one long book, or for it to have ended with Sarai’s death, or even their embrace once she’s reconstituted. The hint of Minya not returning the hug would’ve been enough. I still would’ve begun the next book. I’m not at all a fan of cliff-hangers at the end of books unless they’re REALLY earned. Otherwise it seems a bit cheap to me. If your book is good, I’ll read the next. No need to leave me hanging.

I called every single major plot-point before it happened. I figured out why his skin was turning gray, that he would have the gift he had, and whose child he was (although I also wondered if he could be the child of Azereen?). Nothing was a reveal to me, and I’m not the type to guess everything when I read. It was just super obvious to me here. But that said, I still enjoyed reading it come to fruition. Could not put it down for the second half, actually. 

I think Laini Taylor writes beautifully and has a wonderfully creative mind for world-building. I feel like if she spent a little more time explaining and exploring her world and the characters and relationships and backstories, took out some of the kind of pointless emo-type drama with the godspawn, which felt clunky and out of place next to Lazlo’s story, and if she had maybe woven in a few more early clues and fewer late clues as to the culmination (so it would be harder to guess but easier to trace all the way back when big reveals happen), this would be a perfect book. I just loved the idea of the book and was frustrated with the ending, how much was left out, how many characters we are introduced to for no reason, how many storylines don’t end up playing into anything or going anywhere.

I absolutely LOVED Lazlo as a protagonist. How endearing he was, with his fairy tale broken nose and deep gray eyes and love for stories. His kindness and virtue. Even his innocence. I adored him. I enjoyed Calixte and was disappointed she wasn’t featured more prominently. So many interesting characters who we barely meet or talk to. So many who seemed so interesting, but we heard so little from them and what we did hear was fairly one-dimensional. Eril-Fane. His mother. Azereen. Thyon. Calixte. Drave. Even the godspawn weren’t fleshed out much, other than their individual powers and romantic inclinations, none of which wove into the actual story at all.

I also think there was too much time spent on stuff that ended up meaningless or not very important. Like Lazlo’s sacred promise to Thyon, his knowledge of stories, the azoth recipe he solved and gave to Thyon, Thyon’s relationship with his family, his connection with his spectral, the descriptions and introduction to monsters like the threaves, the wraith, the talents of the other faranji, Calixte’s wager about climbing the anchor, the buildings and institutions crushed by the anchors, the love story with Ruby and Feral, and the powers of the godspawn other than Minya and Sarai. So many things introduced and then never utilized or elaborated on. Things that seemed important but then never came into play. So much wasted potential there! 

Or alternatively, things that never seemed that important and, turns out, truly weren’t. Looking at you, Feral/Ruby. 

I read in an interview that Taylor does not use any kind of outline and just lets the story take her where it will, and unfortunately, with all these loose threads hanging around, it shows. I would’ve liked for her to go over her work and give all those threads a little more explanation or some satisfying conclusions at the very least, or better yet if she’d found ways to weave them into the main story, instead of having all these awesome ideas prove fairly meaningless.

In all, I really did enjoy this book, and I’m already beginning the second. I couldn’t put it down, and although the story had its flaws, the writing was really beautifully descriptive. And y’all, I LOVE Lazlo. It’s just frustrating how NEARLY perfect this book is. I could just FEEL the author’s potential for greatness, and the story’s potential for being a true modern epic, and that made the flaws hurt all the more. I would not waste my time lamenting and going over the flaws if the book didn’t mean something to me.

 I would rate it 4.5 stars for prose and 3 for storytelling. Maybe 3.5 when you consider that it’s a YA novel. Either way, I look forward to reading Laini Taylor’s future works as she grows as a storyteller.

I would love to hear how others feel about the book, and my review. I am honestly dying to discuss it!",1
189,"Most effective general in fantasy? (spoilers: all writing and everything to be written)Thinking of historical figures like Alexander and Belisarius has got me wondering who the most effective general in fantasy literature might be.

Candidates I can come up with include:

Tavore Paran - marched an army across the world and won a few wars in the process, ultimately liberating a continenent

anasurimbor kellhus - He conquered the world through his incredible foresight, but was ultimately killed. His command of magic played a big role which perhaps overshadows his ability on the battlefield.

Aegon the Conqueror - GRRM goes to great lengths to show it wasn't just dragons that allowed him to conquer Westeros.

190,"I just finished Mad ShipIt was good. I hesitate to call it great because there are some things that I find a little lacking, but most of it was compensated by other elements to bring it all together. 

**Review**

**What I liked**

* The characters. The best thing about Robin Hobb's work is by far the characters. The prose, dialogue, and worldbuilding are nothing to sneeze at, but it's the characters that make it all work. Kennit was my favorite in Ship of Magic and is still my favorite in Mad Ship. This smart, charismatic, manipulative, insane bastard is such a delight to read about. I don't think I've ever read a character quite like him. &gt;! The ascension to become a beloved king/ruler is a trope that I can't get enough of. Like the first book, it's a bit far-fetched sometimes, but Kennit is just so much fun that I let it slide. His backstory and the gradual reveal is maddening and thus well-executed too. !&lt; I liked Althea, Wintrow, and Brashen's characters better now that there are more layers to them and because they have more interactions with other characters. Their growth has been slow and steady - the way it should be. 
* Worldbuilding. Somehow, Hobb strikes the balance between Rothfuss-style hints and Sanderson-style avalanches. It's the perfect combination that lets me piece things together, feeling at once close and far from the full picture. It's infuriating in the best way. 
* Agency. I never realized how much I wanted protagonists to actually do something until they did. Technically it's still a reaction, &gt;! but the decision to take the Paragon and save Vivacia felt daring. That was the point that hooked me. !&lt;
* The liveships. Both of their development has been stellar. &gt;! I liked Vivacia's 'descent' into piracy. It makes perfect sense for an impressionable young woman with an identity crisis to have Stockholm Syndrome and enjoy being groomed with a charismatic and driven madman. Paragon's slow improvement is also impressive. It's difficult to have a character become more sympathetic while retaining that unpredictability, but Robin Hobb pulls it off once more. I still can't believe the character I related to the most is a talking ship. !&lt;

**What I didn't like**

* Pacing. The eternal problem with Robin Hobb's work has always been the pacing. I feel like at least 10% of the book could be removed or condensed and it would've been better, but now that I'm asking myself what I would change, I struggle to find the solution. Maybe I'm just used to fast-paced books.
* Malta. &gt;! I understood her role in the book even when she was a brat. I liked her growth as a character but the change felt a little rushed. There was a traumatic event that caused it, but her development only happened after a few pages explaining her sudden maturity. I can buy it, but if it's going to be a slow book anyway, then I think she could've taken more time with her. !&lt;
* Investment. I'm not sure what it is, but I was never invested in the characters. I was interested, but I never saw them as more than just characters that I read about vicariously. It's a far cry from Fitz, Burrich, Chade, Patience, and the rest of the Farseer gang. During the particularly slow first half of the book I could only think about starting the Tawny Man trilogy.
* Serilla. Maybe it was necessary, but I think her POV was boring, didn't bring anything new to the table, and only served as shock value to make us the Satrap more. 

**TL;DR** Objective and personal 7.9/10. A small dip in quality from Ship of Destiny but still solid. 

**Thoughts, theories, and wild guesses (SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION!)**

* The serpents will all go to the Rain Wilds, where Tintaglia will call in a favor for Malta and Reyn to turn into dragons. They will then follow She Who Remembers' memories and be indebted to Wintrow. 
* Paragon was attacked by Igrot and knows where his treasure is. He's the last member of his crew, the only one Kennit couldn't kill. The treasure will somehow be related to the Elderlings, maybe an instruction of how to find them, or the Skill needed to navigate their cities.
* The rescue team will find Vivacia and give her a chance to go, but she'll refuse to leave Kennit in a crucial moment and Kennit will use that moment to kill Althea/Brashen. This causes Wintrow to snap and command the dragons to kill Kennit. 
* Malta will fall in love with Reyn and they'll have the only happy ending. The other Vestrits will die, except Wintrow and Althea.
* Kyle will return with Kennit's mother as a hostage. Kennit will kill them both. 
* Bingtown will declare independence and maybe join the pirates' kingdom. The dragons will fend off Jamillia or Chalced, but most likely both. 
* The Satrap will be killed in the first half of the book. 

I hope you enjoyed reading my review and thoughts. Even if you're intimidated by the slow pacing, everyone should read the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogy. Robin Hobb deserves more than an eternal TBR status. Give it a shot!

P.S. Isn't Jek one of Patience's guards?

Who did it need to be kept safe from if the owls aren't actually antagonistic? (Are they not actually antagonistic?) Who cut off the story sculptor's hands?

So the pirate is a metaphor but the pirate is also Time. Does that mean the first pirate story we read, where the woman is killed in the pirate's place, is the same event as the first time Fate was killed for loving Time? Or was that a later incarnation?

I'm looking for suggestions to fantasy, in particular fantasy-crossover (perhaps fantasy/sci-fi or fantasy/dystopian etc) books that feature a female coming of age arc, or a female protagonist who rises from the bottom and becomes someone important/powerful in the end. 

Preferably non-YA but open to YA also since I know the lines are blurred a bit. Something similar to Mistborn or Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy or Brent Week's Lightbringer if Fitz / Kip were female.

Or something like a Star Wars / Luke Skywalker type of arc but with a female protagonist. 

Thanks!",1
197,"Recently finished Battle Mage by Peter A. FlanneryI loved the non-stop action (in the second half), the character and world development, and that it's a one-off book.

I found it hard to put the book down when in the final third, meaning I went from 67% read (on my Kindle) to finishing the book much quicker than I usually would. The constant action at this stage does definitely keep you hooked.

I literally fist pumped a few times in the book, which is not something I usually do!

Whilst I would have liked to see a little more expansion into Falco's and &gt;!Malaki/Byrna's!&lt; storylines (well, Falco's storyline &gt;!after become one of the most powerful battle mages ever!&lt;), I think that Battle Mage works well as a single book due to the overarching &gt;!""Falco vs the possessed""!&lt; storyline which is pretty much wrapped up by the end.

I probably enjoyed Battle Mage as much, if not more so, than I did Dune. It's up there as one of my favorite books, which I wasn't expecting when my wife randomly bought a '99p fantasy book' for me (as my Kindle is linked to her account).",1
198,Should the Riftwar Saga get a TV Show or movie adaptation?I'd prefer a movie but the quality of TV these days is pretty good. I think the first riftwar trilogy would be fairly easy to adapt to TV because it is like Lord of the Rings and the fantasy is not too wacky so it would appeal to most fantasy fans who have not heard of it yet. But it's still quite serious at times and has lots of action but is not too hard to read like the Wheel of Time. Any thoughts on this idea? Doubt it would ever happen but it would be cool. Even if it was an animated series of some kind.,1
199,"Any good steampunk fantasy series/books?What it says on the tin.

Any fantasy stories (magic, elves orcs dwarves, the whole works) set in a distinctly Victorian style steam-powered world.

It's an odd request I know, but I've had a weird hankering for it. Any suggestions? Door-stopper length is preferable.

Note: Have read the Clockwork series by Cassandra Clare. Too YA for my liking. Something a bit more story-heavy, like something by Sanderson?",1
200,"I finally started the Wheel Of Time but I don't get it. What am I missing?I'm on Chapter 23 of The Eye Of The World. 

The plot and setting seems very generic LOTR ripoff. 
The characterisation relies heavily on tropes.
No-one's motivations are explored. 
Lots of mystery for no reason, mostly surrounding the not-Gandalf character. 
People behave in bizarre and illogical ways considering the trauma they've been through - looking for treasure hours after dodging death etc. 

I'd love to know what everyone sees in this series! Please tell me it gets better and I'll be another devotee in a few months. 

Thanks.",1
201,"Warhammer Fantasy - I'm looking for 2 specific books, and trying to find themGood day. It's my first post here, after a few unsuccessful attempts on the many Warhammer subreddits spread way too thin.

I already finished quite some books in this universe that mostly don't strictly relate to each other aside from a few references, and a chronological order that is more on a historical scale. Such as the Rise of Nagash is in no way related to the Vampire Wars given the millenia between them, aside from the fact that without events in the former vampires wouldn't exist in the latter.

However, there are some more direct, immediate continuation in stories that I would like to follow upon, I just don't know where to look for that.

So far I've read:

* The Rise of Nagash by Mike Lee
* The Sundering by Gav Thorpe
* Vampire Wars - The von Carstein trilogy by Steven Savile
* War of Vengeance trilogy omnibus by various authors, I only finished book 1 (disliked it).
* Tyrion &amp; Teclis by William King

I know these are roughly in chronological order. However there are quite some extremely important characters who's storylines are not continued, and far from finished in Warhammer Fantasy's history.

Namely **Neferata,** the exiled queen of Lahmia and the first vampire (Rise of Nagash leaves her when she is leaving her city in a boat). She is a long way from the Silver Pinnacle where eventually she'll end up and make her new home. I'd like to read about her traveling there, getting the place from the dwarfs and rising to power again, estabilishing the lahmian spy networks and so on.

Tyrion &amp; Teclis ends with the final battle won and just literally ends there in that moment with no followup whatsoever to how the asur society recovers (if at all before the End Times?) and more importantly, what the hell happened to **Malekith** who just disappeared to thin air in front of everyone. According to wiki, he teleported to the Realm of Chaos. But this is something I want a novel about, to continue Malekith's story where it left off, and pick it up with him being the Realm of Chaos.

Which books countinue the stories of the 2 highlighted characters from this point in their lives? I wouldn't want to skip to the End Times if there is more in between. I know of Neferata by Josh Reynolds, but it's a very old book impossible to find (ebook isn't an option, if you can find any physical book store source I'd greatly appriciate it) but I'm completely baffled about how Malekith ended up and I don't want to start an End Times book by skipping and important part of his story.

Thank you in advance!

202,"Warpriest or RPG type Cleric MC NovelsI have read the Cleric Quintent by Salvador and liked it well enough. I have also seen various stories with priests and healers and also books with paladins like Paks, etc.

But are there any books or stories where there is an armored fighty cleric? Like definitely an ordained priest or minister or whatever of a chosen deity who channels that beings power for fighting and healing? I am thinking shield, big hammer, armor, and slinging holy magic everywhere?

Also, sometimes the line between paladins and clerics get blurred. To me, paladins are knights in shining armor while a cleric is fighting holy man. Just to give you insight on what I am looking for.

206,"The r/Fantasy Top Books you FINISHED in 2019 - Voting Thread# The thread has now been locked so that the votes can be counted.
  
---  
Hey everyone, it's time for another one of [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy)'s big lists! 

This is the [second year in a row](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ah1tg8/the_rfantasy_top_books_you_finished_in_2018/) I'm running this poll. I've always been really curious how reading habits of this subreddit would change over time - and how would a poll limited to a year's reading compare to the all-time favourite toplist. So obviously, once was not enough.    
  
Besides, sometimes you just want to mess around with Excel.     
  
The rules are fairly standard:

# 1. Make a list of UP TO TEN of your favourite books/series that you finished in 2019

Just post your top ten series or standalone books that you finished this year. Less is fine, no judgement here! If the book is part of a series, then please just list it as the series. For example, if one of your 2019 favourites is Memories of Ice, just list it as Malazan. This is also going to be a SFF list, not just the F, so go crazy.   

By favorite, I don't mean the books you think are best, just your favourite books and series. This thread isn't meant to be a commentary on what series/books are objectively best...Just what you Redditors love the most.

# 2. Only books you finished *for the first time* in 2019 count. 
  
Pretty self-explanatory. This is not an all-times top 10 list, just a poll to see what your best finds of the year were. When the book was published doesn't matter, just that you first finished it this year. For the purpose of this list, **REREADS DON'T COUNT.** 

# 3. Only one book from any single series, please

Everything in the same world will get one entry. Disworld, Riyria, First Law, Middle-Earth, Realm of the Elderlings, Broken Empire...Cosmere is still separate though, because they're different worlds. Books that are only barely set on the same world won't be clumped together; e.g. things like The Lions of Al-Rassan and The Sarantine Mosaic.

That said, in the end I'll be deciding on a per-case basis, though the [regular top lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/lists) are a good guide for what things will be clumped together.

**Edit:** An even better guide is [last year's full spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dX7pBZz-1f7fAFttLr6-klj19F1tl7xoUstZk3cqBkM/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to consult it if you wonder how exactly things will be grouped. I will attempt to be as consistent as I can.  
  
#4. Please format your vote correctly

The votes will be tallied with a script, so proper formatting is especially important to ensure it all goes smoothly. Incorrectly formatted votes **will not count**. I am going to be lenient with warnings and will help you fix it, but ultimately your vote is your responsibility.   
   
To format correctly:  
   
* **Put each vote on a new line.** To do so, keep a blank line between every vote OR put two spaces before pressing enter. Making it a bulletpoint list is fine.  
* **Format your vote as Title by Author or as Title - Author.** If unsure, please look at how most do it. Italics or bolding should be perfectly fine. Common mistakes are putting the author first, listing just the book name, omitting the ""-"" or ""by"" separator...please do not do that or your vote will not be counted. 
* **Please leave all commentary and discussion for the discussion posts under each original post.** In your voting comment, just list your top ten. This thread has the potential to be huge, and it'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. However, you can reply to voting comments with all the arguments and discussion you want! 

# 5. Voting info 

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that book or series. Upvotes and downvotes have no effect on the final result, though of course you're free to upvote if you see a list you especially like.

**The voting will run for exactly one week**

Seven days should be enough time for people to edit votes if they forgot a series they loved, and also allow the lurkers that only visit once every few days time to vote. When the time is up, the thread will be locked so the votes can be counted.

207,"Four short reviewsMy last post experimenting with brief reviews was well-received (much thanks to those who left nice comments, even if I didn't respond to each one individually) so I'm at it again.

1. ***The Citadel of the Autarch*** **by Gene Wolfe.** The fourth and final volume in Wolfe's *The Book of the New Sun* series. Severian, wandering renegade from the Guild of Torturers, finds himself drawn into the military and political machinations of a great war. The book completes the circle of his journey that began in the first book. My only complaint about this book, and the *New Sun* series as a whole, is that it took me so long to find it; I wish I had read this when I was younger, and had been able to re-read it and re-absorb it several times during the ensuing decades. The *New Sun* books possess a lovely, baroque prose style and a real sense of an archaic, dying world with multiple layers like an archaeological site from deep antiquity. The *New Sun* as a whole doesn't have a straightforward action/adventure narrative (it's a SFF *Bildungsroman*) and *Citadel* is even more introspective and meandering than the previous books, but it feels like a natural and fitting end to the series.
2. ***Apocalypse Nyx*** **by Kameron Hurley.** A collection of short stories featuring the bounty hunter and ex-government assassin Nyx from Hurley's *Bel Dame Apocrypha* series. The *Bel Dame Apocrypha* series, especially the first book *God's War*, are some of my favorite SFF stories from a modern writer (definitely top five), and I love the character of Nyx. She's a tough and gritty antihero but she's not completely amoral, she gets shit done but she's not an overpowered video game character. These short stories all follow the same general outline--Nyx takes a job, shit gets fucked up--they're relatively low-stakes and feel like episodes of a tv series. They're fun, they have good action, but the best part about them is how they look at the relationships between Nyx and her ragtag bounty hunter team. The stories are good but not great; I enjoyed them a lot because I like the characters and the world a great deal, but they're not the best starting place for someone new to Nyx or Hurley in general (Hurley develops the characters and the world better in the novels). If you already like the *Bel Dame* novels you'll enjoy the stories, but skip them until you've read the novels first.
3. ***Fast Color*** **(2018 film, dir. Julia Hart).** In a near-future world suffering extreme drought Ruth, a woman with supernatural powers she cannot control, returns home to her mother and her young daughter while fleeing from government agents who want to imprison and study her. All of the women in Ruth's family have abilities--generally speaking, the ability to take things apart and put them back together again--and Ruth hopes that she can learn to control them. I enjoyed this film a great deal. It's far more low-key than the big budget superhero stories that dominate the box office now--the story is about relationships, about healing estranged relationships, about redemption. The supernatural abilities have symbolic and not just narrative purpose: the characters state how their supernatural powers ""can't fix something already broken"" and the movie explores the question, how *do* you fix something already broken? The movie occasionally feels a little too maudlin (the soundtrack especially gave me this impression, but I couldn't say exactly why) but the performances are all very good and make this movie a good character-driven counterbalance to modern superhero and SFF films which think explosions + punching = emotional depth.
4. ***Sorcerer's Son*** **by Phyllis Eisenstein.** Gildrum is an enslaved demon who, as part of a plan devised by his paranoid master Rezhyk, seduces the sorcerer Lady Delivev in the guise of an errant knight. Delivev becomes pregnant, as per the plan; but the plan goes awry when Gildrum falls in love and, after the demon is forced to return to his master, Delivev keeps the child, a boy she names Cray. The primary story of the novel is Cray's quest to find his ""knight errant"" father and find his own proper place in the world. *Sorcerer's Son*, published in 1979, is vintage High Fantasy with powerful wizards and brave knights set in a pseudo-medieval European land, and it's delightful. It isn't exactly a ""slice of life"" story but the stakes are generally low-key--Clay's coming-of-age as he searches for the identity of his father--though there are some scattered combat scenes and a rather exciting climax as &gt;!Rezhyk and Delivev engage in long distance sorcerous warfare and Cray attacks Rezhyk with a demon army of his own!&lt;. The prose is smooth and evocative, definitely more akin to Tolkien and that era than what is commonly published today. The novel is slow-paced but that pacing works for the character-driven stakes of the story. I'm not sure how I heard about this one (searching ""Phyllis Eisenstein"" gives only five hits in r/Fantasy from the last eight years) but I'm glad I did and I'll be on the lookout for more of her books. (Interesting tidbit: apparently the reason *Game of Thrones* has dragons in it is because Eisenstein convinced GRRM it was the way to go.)",1
208,"Do You Consider The Witcher Book Series To Be Sexist?I'm contemplating reading the witcher book series, but I'm hesitant because I hate books where women are just there for ""background noise"" or to be love interests only.

209,Has anyone tried Serial Box?I just finished This Is How You Lose the Time War and saw that the writers also do work for this app called [Serial Box](https://www.serialbox.com/). I'm curious if anyone has tried it. It sounds kinda interesting and they've even got some licensed stuff like Marvel.,1
210,"Is it bad or stupid to like simpler prose? Certainly not!I've been thinking about something I've read for a decent bit now - a Youtube comment, of all things, on a video comparing The Lord of the Rings to The Wheel of Time and discussing the relative pros and cons. The comment was in disagreement over saying WoT is more readable, and said, slightly paraphrased, ""It's not that Lord of the Rings is hard, it's that nobody writes above a 6th grade reading level anymore. People are too stupid and have too short attention span for anything harder than what a child could read these days.""

It may seem strange - hell, it *is* strange - to be suddenly questioning oneself over a comment from a notoriously unfriendly website, but nonetheless I keep thinking about this. I know this person isn't the first to say that fantasy prose should be fantastical - Ursula LeGuin has a piece on this and I suspect she would be less than happy with the popularity of Sanderson and his relatively workmanlike vocabulary - but it still isn't an opinion I see discussed very vehemently.

As for me, I certainly can appreciate a well-formed sentence, though it isn't usually the main drive. The Farseer Trilogy hooked me with the prose in the first couple pages until the story proper began, but if the story never went anywhere the nice words wouldn't have meant much. Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is another book with fantastic prose that ties into its time period and kept the book strong in my memory, standing out against many other novels in its unique writing. But so too do I like Sanderson, who admits he isn't the best wordsmith, and I had a strong distaste for Herzog (not fantasy, to be fair) despite the fact that I can appreciate the well-formed nature of its sentences. I also hold adamant that The Lord of the Rings is hard for many reasons, the writing style being only one of them.

I suppose, despite how much I've been perseverating on it, I disagree with the anonymous commenter. No, I don't think it's a sign of the end times that prose has become simpler, and I don't think that we're all too stupid or impatient to read past a 6th grade reading level - or even that modern fantasy *is* at such a level! 

Still, I think it's an intriguing question. So what do you think? Is the increasingly prosaic nature of fantasy a bad thing? A good thing? An exaggerated myth, very much reality, or real but not a big deal to you?",1
211,"Robin Hobb, a good writer, but I have questionsI finished the Farseer trilogy and I felt the last book dragged and the ending was not as exciting as I thought it would be. It's a long series. Has anyone read the whole thing? What are your opinions?",1
212,"Question About Gene Wolfe and The Book of the New SunWolfe gets a lot of praise for this series and it comes up quite a lot on this sub. I just started reading one of his books (The Knight) and noticed he also has a series called The Book of the Short Sun (comprised of On Blue's Waters, In Green's Jungles, and Return to the Whorl), a duology called The Book of the Long Sun (Litany of the Long Sun, Epiphany of the Long Sun), and a novel called The Urth of the New Sun. Are these all connected in some way? If so, why are they never mentioned whenever The Book of the New Sun is brought up?",1
213,"Easy to read books don't get enough creditI am a huge fantasy reader. Over the last 2 years I have read a total of around 250 fantasy books. These books ranged from super complex, multi-book series to quick solo novels. 

My favorite are the easy to read books by far and this isn't for the reason you think. Super complex, long book series can be emotionally and mentally draining. Series like Wheel of Time and Malazan, have so many plot points and varying points of views that as a reader, it can be taxing. Easy to read novels, or ""Break Books"" as I call them, can be the most refreshing things to read. No multiple points of view, no super complex story line, just an easy to digest story. I am not saying this as an insult, far from it. Most of these books are incredibly entertaining, well thought out and amazing in their own right. I just don't believe they get the recognition they deserve. Yeah, super complex books are incredible but sometime you just need that simple  entertaining book to cool off.

214,"Quick-ish review of The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern## synopsis

*When Zachary was 11 years old, he found a painted door. He didn’t  go through it. Years later while he is pursuing his Masters degree, he  comes across a book that contains a passage about him and the painted  door. This leads him to try and discover more information about the  book, its author, and the painted door.* *Along the way, he also learns about the starless sea.*

## structure

Zachary discovers that whoever donated the first book also donated more books to the library. [**The Starless Sea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43575115-the-starless-sea)  is interspersed with passages from these books. (I mean this next part  in a good way.) It’s as though we’ve walked in on an almost finished  jigsaw puzzle: The major parts are all there, but they aren’t connected  or laid out in any sort of order. It creates a really interesting  reading experience, where we get a more linear plot with Zachary mixed  with the jigsaw pieces of the other books.

## thoughts

Honestly, it’s hard for me to do anything but gush about this book.  The prose is simply gorgeous. It keeps up the mystical atmosphere  without weighing it down or being overly complicated. In a way, the book  itself feels like a book for readers. Zachary reads about these  mysterious happenings while himself experiencing mysterious happenings.  It’s a book of second chances and patience. A girl leaves a note that a  boy finds nearly 8 years later. Another boy finds a painted door, only  to get another chance at going through it in his future.

We explore an underground where The Kitchen can make nearly anything  you desire and where linear time has taken a cruise. We meet a strange  woman dressed as Max from *Where the Wild Things Are* and a man  called Dorian. Perhaps the woman simply wants to have adventures.  Perhaps the man hides dark secrets. This book is full of symbolism, so I  wouldn’t be surprised if these names were purposefully chosen.

Some people might find the book slow-paced, but I was so intrigued  the whole way through because the story kept moving and beckoning me to  follow. What helps make the story so compelling are its aforementioned  prose and its characters. Zachary is a young gay man, and we get to read  about him falling in love. We read about Max and Dorian as they go  through their own personal journeys while also mentoring Zachary. We  read about a group of people who want to get the donated books away from  Zachary.

There are so many layers and complexities stitched together to create  a marvelous story. And yet, it’s so readable. Nothing about this book  felt overly complicated. It was the perfect Goldilocks effect.

## basically

**The Starless Sea** by Erin Morgenstern is a book for readers, and it has been lovingly crafted. I loved practically everything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***I am the locusts and the frogs and the rivers of blood. I’m here now.***

My reaction on finishing Riot Baby can be summed up with two simple words: Holy shit. This is a novella that I will have to reread at some point. Riot Baby is a humbling, visceral collage of two lives and the system that exists to crush them at every turn. It is a battle cry, a scream, and a sob for the black community. When people talk about #OwnVoices, this is what they mean. 

Everything about this novella clicked for me. It worked, beautifully, painfully. Some novellas try to compress a larger story into something that feels incomplete, leaving the reader dissatisfied and wanting more. Onyebuchi, however, sidesteps that with liberal use of time skips and a vignette format. Each scene is, to some degree, self-contained. To a reader, the end result is that it feels a bit like a living, breathing photo album. It’s a piece of ergodic literature, requiring that the reader actively participate and put together the puzzle pieces, filling in the blanks on their own. The structure is intentional and creative, allowing for a much larger story to be set into a smaller number of pages. 

The prose, too, helped keep things concise and tidy. Each word, each phrase, packs meaning upon meaning into it. The use of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is particularly effective in creating the overall atmosphere and culture depicted. I’m generally very sensitive to vernacular, jargon, or slang that is shoe-horned in as a cheap way of creating a setting, and that was NOT the case here at all. It felt natural, and slotted in beautifully within the overall writing. The setting informed the way of speaking, rather than the way of speaking being used to create a setting. AAVE was used *because that's how the characters speak.*

Brooklyn, New York. An underpaid single mother with two kids: Ella, and Kevin. She does everything she can to keep them together, but she only has so much to give - especially when Ella begins to grow into something that neither of them can understand. Ella’s Thing, a magic born of anger and fear, gives her control over the world around her. Her brother, Kevin, is smart, bright, on track to stay in school and have a genuine *future*… but when Ella can’t control her Thing and must leave the family, this pushes everything off track for Kev. Or, perhaps, everything already *was* off track - it’s not right that these two kids know that they must hide in the interior closets when cats are gangbangin’ out on their street. It’s not right at these two kids know so many people who have been killed or hurt or assaulted. That, however, is their reality - and their anger at that reality is what Onyebuchi aims to explore in this shattered, fragmented narrative. 

&gt;I want to tell Mama about how things were getting better after Ella’s last attack, how I’ve been studying on the side and maybe getting closer to finding out how Ella could do the things she could do and that I’m gonna keep doing that once I get to college and get my degree. I want to tell Mama that we’re healing, that we’re fixing what we can fix and that nothing’s been broken beyond repair and that the only way we can keep whatever’s eating Ella’s insides from devouring her is to stay together. But more sobs come, and I try to get my brain to move toward a solution, figure out what I can build to get her back, to get at whatever’s hurting her, but I can’t think of nothing.

Kev is the titular Riot Baby, as their mother went into labor during the 1992 riots in LA. When she was rushed to the hospital, it was a complicated birth - just like Ella’s. Onyebuchi takes every scene and explores the social context behind it, creating a much larger narrative than seems possible in such a short novella - in this case, we see the ambivalence of the doctors and the way her pain isn’t taken seriously. It doesn’t matter to them if she lives, dies, or if her child is born healthy. All that matters to them is that she inconvenience them as little as possible, and they fail to even read her chart before walking into her room. That is the treatment that every single scene in this novella gets, and each one is just as much of a gut-punch as the one before it. You are present for their pain, and their anger becomes yours as a reader. 

Ella understands all of that. She is growing, constantly, and lives in the minds of those around her. Where Mama was opaque and mysterious to Kev, she’s an open window to Ella. She hates that they’ve moved to Harlem, and to an extent, she hates Mama for having brought them there. She has so, so much anger, and it’s overflowing - she takes it out  on those around her. She’s been hurt, and she doesn’t know how not to cause hurt any more herself. Her Mama tries to reassure her, telling her that God will help her… but Ella can’t have faith in a God who lets her family be shot at every day, who allows school shootings and church shootings and violence at every turn. 

&gt;“It’s so bad here,” she whimpers.   
“Oh, baby.” A look of helplessness flits across Mama’s face. Desperation, then it passes, and Ella already knows it’s because Mama knows she can’t let Ella see her hopeless, and Ella hates that she has to know that. “Baby, that’s just the Devil at work. But you know there’s more out there than just the Devil.”   
“But everything’s the Devil!”   
“The Devil is busy here.” Mama has taken to smoothing out Ella’s outfit, running her hand down her sleeves. “The gangs, the drugs, all the evil that men do to each other here. Sometimes even the police. That’s the Devil. But you just gotta pray, all right, Ella?”

Time skip. Kev is an adult now, hanging out with the cats who are gangbangin’ in Harlem. He’s at the wrong place, the wrong time, and he ends up in Riker’s awaiting trial. He waits for trial, and waits for trial, and his trial is postponed, and the judge needs more time to prepare, and he stays there becoming more and more violent and more and more out of touch with the outside world for eight years. He never sees a judge. Ella visits him, both in person and using her Thing, but that just makes Ella angrier. The dystopian, science fiction elements of the book begin to slowly creepy in, as the reader begins to get an inkling of the way the police state works in this alternate future. 

&gt;This is the other side of what solitary did to him. The agitation, the running straight into painful memories rather than barricading himself against them. Whatever destructive impulses propelled Kev that night of the attempted armed robbery now augmented by what twenty-three hours in a cell alone for six months will do to a man. Kev looks as though he is staring at the sun, intent on blindness. Ella manages to make it onto the Rikers bus heading back into Queens before crying.

Ella begins to view her Thing less as a gift, less as a curse, and more as a responsibility. She will not, cannot, stand by as these injustices continue to take place around her. And as she flits across the world, it occurs to that maybe she’s the one the world has been waiting for. Maybe it’s up to her to *fix things*. Her Mama is dying, and the world is dying, and everything is wrong - but perhaps she is the one who is right. 

&gt;Six shots into the back of a man fleeing arrest on a child support warrant, or two shots ringing out and cops standing over the prone bleeding body of a young man in the midst of protests commemorating the anniversary of another boy killed by a cop. After each one, Ella had Traveled. Straight to the site of the killing, and she’d touched the ground, breathed in the air, and sucked that history deep into her body. Inhaled the violence of the previous hours. Sometimes it felt pornographic. To go to that cul de sac in McKinley, Texas, where black kids younger than her sat on the ground, handcuffed, while their white neighbors jeered and one cop grabbed a girl in a bathing suit by the arm and hurled her to the ground, then dug his knee into her back while she wailed for her mother. She’d returned from every trip with her head in her hands. What if I’m the answer? she had asked herself. What if I’m the one we’ve been praying for?

And, maybe, she is.

219,"Review - The Bone Ships by RJ Barker - great sea faring story with excellent narrationThe [Bone Ships](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521682-the-bone-ships?from_search=true&amp;qid=gUbpEuRigF&amp;rank=1),Tide Child #1, by RJ Barker is another one of those books that I picked up based on hype alone, and luckily, I loved it. I loved it so much that I ended up relistening to the audiobook two months after finishing it, which I've never done before, so this is gonna be one of those gushing reviews

The worldbuilding is great, the eerie magic lights, the sea-dragon-bone ships and the matriarchal society with some pretty bonkers views ( &gt;!that’s not how you increase natality what is wrong with you? Oh woe so many women are dying in childbirth, let's kill all the firstborns that’ll do wonders for our dwindling population!&lt; ) Sorry. The entire story takes place on and around islands set in one hemisphere of the world, and I’m very curious if further books in the series will give us more info on the rest of the world and the scale of it.

The narrator has such a deep lovely voice, and he does a great job bringing the vivid text to life, one of the cases where I’d recommend going for the audio if you can. I really enjoyed the writing, it has a lot of made-up sailing jargon, but I didn’t have any problems following along, and it’s often quite beautiful and musical, even when it’s just sailors cursing. I found the language sort of playful, a lot of fun with rhythm for instance, which came across great in audio. It also recently won an Earphones Award from Audiofile magazine. There are a lot of made up words that I thought add flavour to the world, most of them are close enough to English, or clear from context, that I didn’t have any problems, things like sither instead of sister, deckchild instead of sailor, different names for the days of the week, etc.

The world itself is dark, which I normally avoid, but because of the humor, the main characters working towards improving this grim reality, and the overall hopeful way characters and their relationships grow, I really liked it. The world also felt very real to me, I think because of all the details of ship life. I can see Tide Child and a lot of the other places they go, and creatures they meet, so clearly in my mind, I almost remember being there.

Joron is the inexperienced, and mostly incompetent, shipwife of Tide Child, a dead bone ship crewed by women and men sentenced to death for their crimes. Luckily for the survival of the crew and ship, the book opens with him losing his command to Lucky Meas, a much more experienced and competent captain. She whips the ship and crew into shape, and draws them into her plan to hunt down an Arakeesian (sea dragon). I absolutely loved everything about how the crew was transformed by having a leader and a purpose, for a rag-tag bunch of drunks to a strong and united crew.  Joron’s the POV character, so naturally it centers on him, and his growth, both in his own eyes and those of the crew is pretty damn great.

Despite Jorun being the MC, and really digging his personal journey, he’s not my favorite character. I read someone else saying how Meas is much more like a typical protagonist, and I agree, it also helps that she’s very kickass. But my favourite character is the tragic Gullaim, a navigator bird-like magical creature (windseeker)  I liked how otherworldly he was, and the story of his people broke my heart.

I thought it was cool how I listened to this in October and then again in January, so being such a short time between them, I was surprised when emotional moments that got me the first time around got me the second time around ( &gt;!it was mostly the Keeshan and Gullaim moments, I’m a huge sucker for extinct dragons come back and lonely magical creature finds friend!&lt; )

221,"r/Fantasy Writer of The Day: Guerric Haché. AMA!Hi r/fantasy! I’m Guerric Haché, I live in Vancouver, Canada, and I’ve signed up to be your writer of the day!

Why today? Well, I just finished self-publishing a 6-book science-fantasy series called [Digitesque](https://www.goodreads.com/series/183319-digitesque)! It’s a dual-POV epic/adventure story set in a distant, post-collapse future of legends and mystic tech, centered around Isavel and Ada, two women who find themselves in unexpected positions of opportunity and power, and promptly make a bunch of mistakes and impulsive decisions while trying to find their place in the world and deal with the leftovers and legacies of their long-dead ancestors.

I thought this would be a nice opportunity to reflect on 5 years of work, to stare shakingly at my own hands asking myself what I’ve done, and to invite everyone else to chat about what goes through the mind of an indie author, about the books, or about anything else really.

For some backstory, Digitesque started out as the first project in a long-term plan I have for trying to build my writing skills. It’s meant to be a sort of baseline, fun and self-indulgent, full of the tropes I love and built in a way to help me map out the challenges of creating books and to help expose areas of my writing I want to work on. My hope, going forward, is to write a bunch of stand-alone stories focusing on more specific aspects of writing I need to improve on, and then to one day return to all the themes and structures of Digitesque that I enjoy and create something new that plays on the same elements but is hopefully stronger for whatever I’ve learned by then.

Aside from being an SFF writer in my spare time, I’m also a professional game designer! I'm currently working as a designer on Age of Empires IV, and I’ve worked on a few other games, most notably Dawn of War III and Company of Heroes 2. I can’t confirm or deny specific details of Age 4, but I’m happy to talk about the profession of game design as a whole, or about video games in general.

I also love cooking; trying to grow my own food plants; listening to podcasts, as well as music that doesn’t generally have lyrics; learning languages; reading webcomics; and cats! I'm into a lot of book and game universes, especially ecclectic ones, from big things like Warcraft or Star Wars to more specialized universes like the Endless universe or the Tensorate series, so if you want to chat about media, ask away!

Any and all questions welcome!

*One last note - for the next few days, Digitesque books 1-3 are free* [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0753GT684?ref_=series_rw_dp_labf)*, and starting tomorrow, Books 4-6 will be discounted in the US and UK. Have at it!*",1
222,"Why are the elves so much hated by the community?Everyone is fantasming about seeing them dying, getting tortured and then going extinct to the point that this is sick (even if this is a fictionnal race)

No matter what they do they will always be insulted:

\- Defend themselves from humans invaders? They are the bad guys and must die

\- Stay isolated? Those arrogants cunts aren't helping humans who are far away they are jackasses

\- Help humans a bit? Meh they didn't do that much actually

\- Attack humans? They are the worst kill them all, even the civilians

Dwarves are loved by everyone and even orcs, gnomes, lizardmens, vampires have many fans, but the elves only have haters who only want to see them die, complain when they are in a good position and know nothing of their lore thus say a lot of wrong things

Also they are underestimated as hell. Everyone think that they are  beggars treehugers who lives in the wood while the drows, Noldors, Eldars from warhammer 40k and others exist but are ignored",1
223,"Interesting fantasy culture recommendationsI think this is a pretty common complaint, although my specific request might be a bit different than normal. There’s a tl;dr at the end if you don’t feel like reading the whole thing.
 
Here goes: I love fantasy. I don’t really have anything against the – for lack of a better descriptor – ‘universal western fantasy culture.’ That sort of medievalish, more or less Fantasy!English (or Fantasy!Nordic) aesthetic, with basically modern sensibilities, either because the author doesn’t actually know that much about real ancient English (/Nordic) culture, or simply has no interest in trying to recreate it faithfully. I don’t have anything against it, but I have read a loooooooooooooot of fantasy, and boy could I go for something different.
 
Here’s my issue. I’m not necessarily talking about simply *featuring* different cultures. This is a crazy easy request to fulfill. Malazan. Boom. Take your pick of any of the dozens. But Malazan doesn’t dive very deep into most of them. This is a pretty common problem with ‘different’ cultures, in various works.
 
I’m talking about delving deep, and *believably*, into the thought processes of people who think radically differently from us. In this sense, I wouldn’t even mind a genuine crack at medieval/dark age/etc. English/Nordic, because almost nobody actually gets anywhere close, despite the trappings.
 
A few examples of where I think it has been done right, or at least compellingly:
 
-          **The Dreamblood Duology** by NK Jemisin. Magic heavy African/Arabian/? city-states, and a big focus on a religion that venerates killing people in their dreams, has ninja dream assassins, etc. The people generally think nothing like we do. I think NK Jemisin’s work becomes more and more self-indulgent and clout-chasing as time goes on, but I really liked this one.
-          Most things by Guy Gavriel Kay. The guy is a huge history nerd, and a great prose writer, and his work in these areas shows. The fact that he basically writes vaguely fantasy versions of real historical time periods probably helps to get in the groove.
-	Jennifer Roberson works, sometimes. I don’t know if she is going for this on purpose, or just hits it incidentally because she uses unusual settings.
-          **A Song of Ice and Fire** had glimmers of this, especially early on. Dorne, Valyria, Iron Islands and some of the Free Cities, read as absolutely alien. This has likely since been either analyzed to death by fans, or ruined by Martin himself. But if anyone can remember those early vibes from before the last two books and the show, it counts. Honestly, this series *almost* counts just for Westeros being so different from the conventional society found in books at the time the first book was published, though we have been crazily oversaturated by similar gritty, low-magic ‘Middle-Earth Sopranos’ since then.
 
 
**TL;DR** Looking for interesting fantasy takes on ‘different’ cultures. These do not, by any means, need to be fantasy versions of real historical cultures (although they probably are, let’s be honest). If someone makes their culture up entirely, and it reads as believable, by all means, please suggest it to me. POVs from a member of the culture in question preferred for obvious reasons, but not necessary.",1

225,"Wheel of Time TV Series vs BooksHello everyone, 

I recently read through the WoT for the first time because so many people rave about it and I have to say that at the end of it I came to the conclusion that the TV series might be able to tell the story better than the books did. I think I came to this conclusion because I read them in 2019/2020 and not when they were first written but I genuinely could not get myself to enjoy a lot of the dialogue throughout the series since most of it was a lot of bashing of the opposite sex for basically everything. Honestly every other paragraph felt like some rant about what the opposite sex does wrong. Could cut like half of it out and still tell the same story with the same gender issues getting across. ( I understand that the world created had gender issues for generations which led to the way people of the opposite sex talked to each other and thought of each other but I just couldn’t enjoy it.) With that being said though the story itself might be a top 3 for me and I actually think that a tv series might be able to tell the story better because it can change the dialogue. The story itself to me was infinitely better than the GoT story so if it’s done well I think it can be a hit for people. I was wondering if anyone else had similar thoughts or am I way off?",1

230,"Just finished reading The Fifth Season... am I missing something?At the beginning of 2020, I challenged myself to read 20 fantasy books by the end of the year, all from different authors and all published within the past decade - the impetus being that I'm thinking about writing my own fantasy short stories and novels eventually and I want to get an idea of the types of plots, characters, worlds and writing styles present in the genre today. 

Most of my prior experience with fantasy has been reading Lord of Rings (x3), A Song of Ice and Fire (x2) and a large portion of R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels. Other than fantasy I typically read a number of bestselling nonfiction books and a fair number of literary fiction novels, particularly works from the Russian masters - though I've certainly have had plenty of exposure to American and British literature. In addition, I really enjoy reading some of the great science fiction works such as 1984, A Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Ender's Game, Starship Troopers, Dune, etc.

My first book I finished this year was The Lies of Locke Lamora, which I thoroughly enjoyed, though I wouldn't say it surpassed my love of LOTR or ASOIAF. 

Next on my list was The Fifth Season - going into this novel my expectations were admittedly high given that it won the Hugo Award (same with the subsequent books in the series). After finishing it today, however, I am at a loss at why so much praise is given to it - the writing style is a bit clunky and the plot is not very compelling, especially its very disappointing climax/resolution. The world building was okay but just seemed like a typical dystopia, the magic system a little unique but nothing ground-breaking (no pun intended), and the characters just seemed a bit exaggerated and inconsistent. And the themes presented were not at all subtle or profound... just depressing and a little arrogant.

I'm aware that as a reader that I might not like every book I read, but given the numerous top awards for the series, I just want to know what I'm missing that others seem to get? Maybe a better question to ask - why do you love The Fifth Season?",1

**Format: Novella, e-book**  
**Review Copy:**  **Provided by NetGalley in return for an honest review.**  
**Release Date: January 28, 2020**

At long last, I’ve gotten my hands on a work by K. J. Parker, an author very well regarded in the wider fantasy community. Judging by the quality of Prosper’s Demon, I have to wonder – what the hell took me so long?

Written in the first person, this novella tells of the trials and tribulations of an unnamed exorcist in a world very like our own during the early Renaissance. Our protagonist is not a nice guy. He is devious, cunning and unscrupulous, a man who shows no qualms when it comes to inflicting pain to his fellow human beings. A vile man, written excellently and with an undercurrent of gallows humour that colours everything in the world around him - this worked very well for me.

The world this exorcist inhabits is one filled with cruelty, pain and Them, an awful lot of Them, demons who possess humans and seem capable of inducing in them extreme states – these creatures can only be seen by a chosen few born with the ability to recognize them, and this ability is as much a gift as a curse…as the protagonist will prove to you, reader.

*You have to learn to think like Them, they told me when I was just starting out in the business; only, don’t get too good at it. They say that to all the students, and none of us really understand what it means at the time.*  
*In and out of each other’s heads, like neighbors in a small, friendly village, which is exactly what we aren’t. Or to put it another way, it doesn’t do to get too familiar.*

The reason *Prosper’s Demon* won me over, though, has to do with it not being your average exorcist/demon game of cat and mouse. Rather, it’s the structure of the story, the fact that a lot of it is built around conversations between the protagonist and the eponymous Prosper, a Leonardo da Vinci-esque genius of unparalleled scientific intellect. A lot is done right in those dialogues, obfuscating the truth, confusing the reader and keeping the outcome of the story questionable at all times.

Some of it, too, has to do with bronzeworking and the casting of statues – and I was struck by how well researched these sections were, by the veracity of complex processes as they were described.

If, like me, you’ve never before read the work of K. J. Parker, *Prosper’s Demon* is an excellent place to start, short but none the poorer in ideas for it. My score? 5/5!

Oh, and the cover? Gorgeous, sets up just the right tone for this strange tale.

237,"Disappointed | Uprooted by Naomi NovikI’ve heard good things about Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik and I couldn’t decide if I wanted to read that book first or Uprooted, which is an earlier work of the author. I decided on Uprooted and I’m sad to say that I did not enjoy reading this book, I was really hoping I’d like it. 

I was really enjoying the book at the beginning, I was fully invested but somewhere along the way I just completely lost interest. My lack of interest in the story had a lot to do with The Dragon, I found this character so unbelievably boring. Also, I might have missed something regarding his description. I imagined him as an older man, not particularly handsome or charming, just powerful and experienced, so imagine my surprise when I realized there was romance sub-plot involving him and the main character (granted, it’s kind of obvious given the synopsis of the book). To me, it felt so out of left field, especially since at no point did I ever feel any chemistry between the characters. However, I will say I really liked how their love story was resolved in the end.

In general, the characters didn’t do much for me. I never felt invested in anyone’s story. That’s about it on that. On the plus side, I didn’t hate them either.

Where this book shines, in my opinion, is the worldbuilding. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and mood the book provided and I’m a sucker for anything set in the forest or the deep ocean so for that reason, I really loved the book’s setting.

There are books where I enjoy politics and armies and court life and all that good stuff but I only enjoy it if I go into a book expecting that, I didn’t expect that in Uprooted and so I didn’t enjoy it when it appeared. The whole plot with the Wood Queen really took me out of the story (thought honestly I had already clocked out by this point.)

I will not name the videogame in fear of potential spoilers, but the premise was this: The protagonist did something so evil and blasphemous, he offended ALL the gods, and he knew he was damned to hell forever no matter what he did. No amount of prayer, repentance, charity, self-sacrifice or other redemptive good deeds could ever save him from eventual damnation. To save himself, he turned to magic to prolong his lifespan, but this magic had an evil cost, adding even further to his debt to hell. With that extended lifespan, he performed evil act after evil act over the course of years. Eventually, he accepts his fate and willingly goes to hell just to end it all. There was only one way for it all to end; all roads led to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other good books or movies that explore this theme? I just like the idea that the protagonist knows they're screwed forever, and how they cope and deal with it. It would take place in a world with a hell of sorts but without a Christ who can save sinners.",1
242,"Why do enjoy webnovels more then fantasy booksSo two or three years ago I start reading  translated manga and I read it  so much that I get bored from the entire medium, Then I accidentally  stumbled upon translated Chinese webnovel called  Otherworldly Evil Monarch wail, I was searching for a light novel and man I enjoyed it so much until the original translator stopped translating because he found out that the novel includes a lot of racism that couldn't simply ignored. 


Then I read a lot of translated Chinese webnovels and Japanese light novels that they changed my entire taste for books, then I discovered royalroad which was previously a translating website and man they have a lot of good webnovels. 

Still for a year I was trying to read epic fantasy book like lord of the ring and the hobbits and a lot of other fantsy books but I couldn't simply get to it except for stormlight archive and the blade itself first three books and the assassin’s apprentice by robin hobb which made me so desperate (I mean people read novels to be happy not depressed)  and others. So the reason I dislike normal novels it is because:


_first from the beginning to know that something epic  would happen near the end of story and a lot of charecters would die.

- most of the cultures are very similar to modern western culture like they have the same norm we have in the last 100 years. For example 
           _ Slevery is bad and every Slave is treaded 
               worse then animal. I mean slavery existed 
              for thousands of years how come every  
              fantasy character is against it, 
            - rape is worse then killing, you see a mass 
               murder  judging a rapist,I mean common 
              when you take the life of someone   you 
               took away every thing he have

                and I have 
                also seen that in a lot of medium which 
                ever it is be it it webnovel or book
              And alot more I would point out this is not 
             all fantsy book just part of it",1
243,"Generic Fantasy Dwarven ""beer"" is carrot wine. Let me tell you why.One of the better known aspects of Generic Fantasy Dwarf culture is their love of beer. Another well-known aspect of it is that Generic Fantasy Dwarves usually live underground and in mountainous regions, in vast halls that were old before Generic Fantasy Elves sang their first poem about moonlight or stars or trees or bees or something boring like that. 

You may recognize this as an environment that is not ideal for growing barley. Of course, Generic Fantasy Dwarves could trade with Humans for barley in exchange for Superior Generic Fantasy Dwarven Craftmanship, but can you trust the produce of those shifty Humans? No you cannot! I mean, come on - they are basically round-eared, short-lived *Elves*, for Moradin's sake!

Also, as we all know, Generic Fantasy Dwarven kingdoms were vast and deep well before  Humans learned which end to poop out of, so Authentic Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer cannot have originally relied on trade with humans. 

Now, do you know what crop is fairly well-suited to mountain soil? You guessed it, carrots - and they grow underground too, and they have a beard*, so basically they are honorary Generic Fantasy Dwarves themselves. 

And can you make something alcoholic out of them? [Of course!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=carrot+wine&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=recipes)

All recipes I can find require to add extra sugar (carrots are somewhat sugary, but apparently not enough to easily get some serious fermentation going on their own); but Generic Fantasy Dwarves could obtain this sugar from beets, for example, that also grow underground and are more Generic Fantasy Dwarvish than bloody *barley*. 

So there you have it. I have made my case, and I think that it is pretty solid: Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer is carrot wine. 

\* *Not sure if this works in English (I looked online and could not find much) but in my native tongue the foliage on top of a carrot is called a ""beard"".*",1

As a result I've been able to burn through some of the shorter books on my TBR and one of those was '*The Horse and His Boy*' from the Chronicles of Narnia. Featured in that story is a lovable elderly hermit that provides the proverbial port in the storm for the main characters. Another example is Vysogota of Corvo from '*The Tower of the Swallow*' from the Witcher  books. He's another 'sanctuary' for a character and uses his wizened age to mentor and console the character in need.

255,"You Should Read: Fell's Five (D&amp;D 4E Comic Books)If you played 4th edition D&amp;D, maligned for its curve away from 3.5, its gameyness, and overall shift in tone, you may be aware of its core setting, Nentir Vale.

If you're aware of Nentir Vale, you probably don't care at all about Nentir Vale.

Ignore all the incredible things it brought to D&amp;D, like Eladrin, the Feywild, the Shadowfell. What does Nentir Vale REALLY offer?  Sure, it's take of small settlements amidst a sea of wilds, monsters, and the occassional weird cult hideout is a fun take and makes for a lot of combat (something 4e was really good at) but... it's just... like 4e itself, it doesn't have that kick, that MWAH that other settings do, that hook, that really interesting thing you want to dig your teeth into.

That is... until you pick up Fell's Five (Okay now we get to talk about books!).

Fell's Five is a comic book series, made up of three volumes written by John Rogers and illustrated (for the most part) by Andrew Di Vito. It follows Fell, a human fighter, and his gang of adventurers; Bree Three Hands the Halfling Rogue, Kahl Kahlundurin the Dwarven Paladin, Tisha Sworhnheart the Tiefling Warlock, and Varis the Elven Ranger. 

This story, though I made it seem so earlier, doesn't actually define or truly flesh out the setting of Nentir Vale, instead it works to portray that... you don't really need to! It plays on this raw type of D&amp;D gameplay, where the players quip and fight monsters and then go home, satisfied with another night eating snacks with their friends. And in that... it's so beautiful!

The characters have strong personalities, but never really bump up against eachother to create schism, their histories are a little intertwined but not entirely, and their backstories continue cropping up and everyone has their own time to shine. It really does just... feel like an ACTUAL D&amp;D campaign where you just wanted to get your friends together to have fun. The DM goes out of their way, of course, to give as much story as they can, really hooking in the players for the exceptionally well drawn and paced action... oh right, the art is all amazing, the D&amp;D monsters are rendered so wonderfully and I'm still blown away by the wilds portrayed here.

If you want some raw heroic fantasy, what really inspired a lot of my own DMing, a bunch of great characters going on an adventure, or just something that makes you think ""Wow... that's D&amp;D..."" Go buy the new Baldur's Gate series!... but also Fell's Five, please buy Fell's Five! You can get it at IDW publishing. They're called ""Dungeons and Dragons"" (to make it exceptionally annoying) and there's only three volumes.",1

262,"What does Fantasy encompass/mean to you?I have found that, when I tell people I write Fantasy, the average person automatically pictures that I write about dwarfs and elves and magic castles. For me, writing Fantasy is my way of speculating about things. Imaging the past or the future, or rehashing the present in a setting other than Earth (to make it more exciting). Exploring the boundaries of time and space through characters and worlds without being reasonably grounded with science, as with science-fiction, can be a cathartic experience. What does Fantasy mean to me? It means ""no-holds barred."" What does it mean to you?",1
263,"Review: Sunshine Patriots by Bill Campbell**Prelude**: New Year came and I hit the bingo panic button. From now on and until I am finished, all reading is guaranteed bingo reading.

**Book**: Bill Campbell, **Sunshine Patriots**

**Bingo Squares**: (a) Slice of life (probably), (b) featuring a character with disability (Aaron Barber, and pretty much the rest of the cast), (c) local author (Washington, D.C.), (d) Features ocean setting (barely, but qualifies), (e) Afrofuturism, (f) #OwnVoices

**Bingo Square I am using it for**: Afrofuturism.

**Plot:**  A couple of centuries in the future, Earth is united under the rule of a long-term president. The Freedom Forces are the peacekeeping arm, that is sent both to quell uprisings in domestic provinces, and exterminate alien life on new colonies. Sergeant Aaron Barber is a hero of Freedom forces, a face plastered on every corner, a husband of Miss Universe, and a putative candidate for Vice President slot in the next election.

He also has metallic arms and legs, no lips or nose, cannot speak, ingests nutrients via injection, and smokes weed through a hole in his throat. On a mission to destroy the ""mongrel"" uprising on an Earth colony Demeter Aaron leads a squad of veterans like him, and hymies - newly arrived 12-13 year old kids who are replacing recently dead soldiers.  And the denizens of Demeter are not surrendering that easily. With them is The Be - a mysterious diety that helps them feel each other, and gives them a fighting chance against the might of Earth. Slowly, but steadily, the attitude of Aaron and his squad mates towards this fight changes.

**Thoughts**. It's a short, but not easy to read book. It is not easy to read, because a lot of interactions between the main cast of characters - Aaron Barber (a Moses-like figure),  Kento Mbili (the biblical Aaron), Jess Tupea (a Maori woman with a face of a tiger), and others in his squad - addicts, cripples, hymies - are in slang that is difficult to parse.  But it is also not an easy read, because despite the seeming simplicity of the situation - totalitarian regime, propaganda, all of these things are so obvious - the book speaks truth.  This is **indeed** how shit is done now, and with a few technological tricks, this is how it will be done in the future. He wrote the book in 2004 - clearly under the impression of Iraqi wars, but fuck if this isn't how wars are fought in Russia since 2014, and in a lot of other places. Fuck if it isn't how Nigerian militas work. And fuck if the wars aren't going to continue being fought this way in the foreseeable future.

For a book that is only about 200 pages, there is a lot of time given to character development ,and in that respect, Barber, the titular protagonist, is actually not the most important one. When we are in his head, we see a lost kid who is way over his head, and who barely has a coping mechanism to speak of.  It's his squadmates: the ""witch doctor"" Kento Mbili,  Jess Tupea, the hymies Chela Lempira and Hank Kpa, the desperate addict Sergey Kozachenko, and no less desperate asshole Nick Tejo, Pvt. Camila Rastrepo, who carries trading cards of Catholic Saints in her backpack - these people get a lot of screen time as POV characters, and a lot of character development leading them to their disparate eventual fates.

The worldbuilding in the book is done primarily through short inserts from news reels, video broadcasts, and such. They give an idea of the situation the Earth finds itself in, lets us peek under the veneer of ""patriotic"" reporting,  and set the stage. Unfortunately, the worldbuilding is relatively piecemeal - which for a 200-page book is to be expected. So some things: like the teleportation used solely to deliver new 12-year old recruits to the front lines, are not properly explained.
There is also a parallel set of developments - we get some insight into the defenders of Demeter and The Be via a sequence of diary entries of one of the resistance, but if there is one part of the book that is not fleshed out as well as it could be - it is that.

This is an uneasy book to read. But at the end, it is a well-written and well-argued ""fuck ya'll"" message to all the right people.

**Content warnings.** Trench love, a.k.a., anal rape is a thing that happens routinely in, well, trenches. We get a fairly graphic scene at some point in the book. It becomes a defining factor for one of the characters. It is not an easy read. It might very well be not your thing.

**Who will like it.** Pacifists. People who are tired of ""land on a planet, kill all monsters"" science fiction. Those who liked **1984** and, well, **Hunger Games**. 

**Who will not like it.** If you are English-as-a-second language reader, and have to look up words in the books you read, this book will be hard to read, as slang is very thick. If you think Palpatine is a misunderstood genius, this is also probably not a book for you.

**Rating:**  It was a toss-up between the **C-list** and the **B-list** all through the second half of the book. Having spent a few days thinking of it as a whole, the character moments do stand out enough for a ""just about made it to **B-list**"" rating.

269,"Review - Fate of the Fallen by Kel KadeI was excited to read this for a potentially unusual reason: I have not heard one peep about this book. Even looking at the post history on Reddit, there were two posts from months ago. I can’t remember the last time I saw a book on the shelf of a bookstore and grabbed it, without any prior knowledge. It was refreshing in all of the best ways. Shoutout to Jaime Jones for [an incredible cover](https://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/FateoftheFallen_full640.jpg?type=vertical&amp;ssl=1), by the way. That cover was a huge part of what drew my attention, in spite of a title that drifts uncomfortably close to a *Fast and the Furious* title.

Keeping things spoiler free in this review (with a link below for a full-spoiler review), I really enjoyed this book. Prophecies are a tricky business as they can easily box an author into a corner. In those situations, the plot can be boring and predictable or rely on deus ex machina or cop outs to resolve itself. Granted this is the first book of a series, Kade shows a willingness to play with the rules of prophecy in exciting ways as well as embracing some of the weirdness that fantasy has to offer.

Character interactions really shined and while I wasn’t the biggest fan of the central character early in the book, the people around him made the book well worth continuing.

I think the book itself (which was a rather short 344 pages) could have taken some more time to let the characters ruminate on what was happening. Once the major catalytic event comes, the book moves at a nearly breakneck pace to the conclusion which, due to the pacing, felt pretty abrupt to me.

All of that said, this book is a blast to read. Kade really leans into the fun of the fantasy genre and it pays off in the best ways. The banter is top-notch, the story challenges tropes and I’m honestly unsure as to how this overall plot will play out.

**Overall: 3.5/5**

270,"Just finished Nevernight Chronicles (spoilers all)Started the series exactly one week ago and today I finish it!

I absolutely loved this series, I still don't understand how an author can make me love some of the characters in this books so much, when they are so messed up... but he does...

Characters and relationships (especially Jonnen and Mia but also Mercurio and Ash too) were probably the best aspect for me about the series (and the prose, which while I understand why some people dislike it, I loved). The plot wasn't incredibly unique by any means but I still enjoyed a lot of the clichés and how they were put together in interesting ways and the characters that shined in them. 

I won't say its perfect, I didn't particularly enjoy the love triangle in the third book, nor the extent it went, though I suppose it paid of in a nice way with them all kinda forgiving each other in a way that felt fair given they're all killers... and god dammit was I tempted to put this book down so many times out of annoyance for where I thought it was going but im really glad I didn't! 

I quite like grimdark in general, having read and loving the first law trilogy, but I was sooo worried that the author was just going to shove it at us. Make everything darker and darker after the first book and take away all the humanity of the characters just for the sake of being (his idea of) grimdark, and while I do think the ending might have been maybe a bit too happy? Especially for what was supposed to be a grimdark book...

...Well, what can I say, I guess sometimes I do like having a somewhat soppy happyish ending. Especially if that happy ending feels earned, these characters went through a ton, and honestly I can't be upset, I cried enough in this book...

Sorry bout long post about mostly nothing, had to get it off my chest! What were your thoughts?",1

273,"An Interview with Grendel**Q:**  We are here today with John Gardner's Grendel, a witty, introverted dreamer of a homicidal troglodyte. One of the strangest characters in fiction. Crude, sub-human yet far more comprehensible than Aragorn or Elric, Cersei or any Malfoi. Welcome, Grendel!      

**A:**  Grendel despises you and wishes to mash your brains against the white invisible barrier of this internet conceptualization.     

**Q:**  Yes but you can't. Let's begin. why do you think Gardner's telling of your story is praised as a masterpiece of 'literary fiction' when ten thousand other novels with trolls, knights, barbarians, dragons and curses are sent to the grubby children's table of the 'fantasy' shelf?      

**A:**  Marketing, primarily. Most of Gardner's novels have subtle fantasy elements, magic realism moments. But he was a university English prof, smoked a 'literary' pipe, wrote about Chaucer. Must be 'literary'. Steven King is a New Englander writing scary stuff; ergo all his work must be horror homage to Shirley J. Peter Beagle is a Tolkien-praising hippy. He could submit a physics paper to Scientific American and it would still be labeled fantasy. Probably have a glowing sword on the cover of the peer-review.       

**Q:**  You don't feel that perhaps the intent of a narrative can decide whether a novel is 'literary' as opposed to 'fantasy'?     

**A:**  Tolkien's intent is to present a Catholic vision of a fallen nature. Fitzgerald tells us that people change, because what they do matters whether they wish or not. George Martin's aim is to remind the mortal reader: winter is coming and no one gets out alive. Dickens tells us that there are no coincidences because all human lives are connected. Shirley Jackson reminds us that the real monsters aren't in the closet, they are in the mirror. 'Intent' in story-telling is a reviewer’s game, little annoying  human.     

**Q:**  But Gardner intends something more than just a retelling of a Scandinavian myth?     

**A:**  Gardner describes my hilariously cynical self patiently analyzing the human condition. Sets poor Grendel to spying through windows, puzzling out what makes humans tick. The son-of-a-bitch has me trip over my feet admiring glorious heroic knights... till I see enough of them stab their best friends in the back. Sets me chasing after God, till I listen to enough maundering priests. Yeah, and I had a crush on a princess. Until I understand its just sex in a skirt. I don't wear pants.     

**Q:**  So his intent was to describe a semi-comic monster puzzling over barbaric humans?     

**A:**  No; that was his method. His intention is to show the readers their human face. A moral intention, ultimately.     

**Q:**  Fantasy is often morality-based.     

**A:**  Gardner wasn't playing D&amp;D games. He jumped on the mead hall table before his east-coast writing peers and shouted his challenge: that morality was the highest purpose of art. Note the adjective. Post-Hemingway writers had been competing to express the purest forms of nihilism, minimalism and carbon-steel irony. Good and Evil weren't just outdated and judgmental; they were officially Bad Writing. Kurt Vonnegut had to slip morality into his stories disguised as comic nihilism. Gardner infuriated the 'literary' establishment when as one of their own, he declared morality as a requirement for the best writing.     

**Q:**  So he chose a monster from a Scandinavian myth, and turned him into... (dun, dun, dun): Grendel, Monster of Cynicism.    

**A:**  I really can't reach you through this white internet thing? I'm flailing my claws. Feel any pain?      

**Q:**  Nope. How do you think 'Grendel' has withstood as a fantasy work?     

**A:**  If Gardner is correct about writing, then there is no escape from the theme he puts into 'Grendel'. And so it stands as a lighthouse on the book shelves, whether writers steer towards it or away.     

**Q:**  What a horribly mixed metaphor.     

**A:**  Poor Grendel is horrible, and mixed, and metaphoric.     

**Q:**  Any last thoughts?     

**A:**  Hmm. I'd bite your limbs off first. I think if I swallowed fast you'd be this kind of chewy center of annoying but sentient self-importance.     

**Q:**  Speaking of self-importance, you haven't mentioned Beowulf.     

**A:**  (Sigh). Him. Fine. Gardner has me, a monster of cynicism consider human values. Heroism, art, romance and holiness. And each time Grendel is moved. At first. But inevitably he sees the flaws, the hypocrisies. Poor Grendel walks through all the structures of human values as if they were beautifully shaped fog. Until he meets Beowulf. An unstoppable force who smashes poor Grendel's face into the wall, saying there is a reality of beauty, of love, of goodness. It is Grendel's destruction. And yet it carries a tone of hope. When the tale ends with the words *“Poor Grendel's had an accident. So may you all.”* he is not cursing the reader. He is hoping that others also find a reality beyond the disappointments.     

**Q:**  And our time is *ouch*!    

**A:**  You felt that? Ooh. How about this? 

**Q:**  Stop! This is virtual, you can't... Help! Mods! Rule #1! Help!  (chewing sounds)     

**A:**  Poor St. Elmo's had an accident. So may you all.

278,"Between Two Fires by Christopher BuehlmanWowza this is good! Set in pre-15th century France, a group of travellers are making there way to Paris due to a young innocent woman's instinct and faith. The world is overrun by plague, heaven has fallen, god is not home, and the devils are swarming the world. It's definitely a grim dark tale so far and the world is decaying.

Poetic at times, vile, and darkly humorous with Gothic imagery, this ticks all of my boxes. IT IS THE CLOSEST I'VE READ TO A DARK SOULS WORLD (other recs that fit the Dark Souls model would be much appreciated).

For those who like The Empires of Dust, The Prince of Nothing, Cormac McCarthy, The Vagrant, and Raven's Mark... This is for you. It's my kind of fantasy and wanted to shed light on this gem.

Do you experience this often or sometimes?  What books overstayed their welcome for you?

The Wheel of Time series, most YA books (here's looking at you Hunger Games and company), The Passage (which is a shame because I loved the 1st two).",1

281,"Can the classic four elements really form a good magic system in games?It bugs me that whenever we have elemental magic/damage in a fantasy game, the elements most probably are fire, ice and lightning - just three, with one (Fire) straight from the classic four, and two roughly corresponding to Water (ice) and Air (lightning, or storm). It's totally understandable from a design point of view, since games are mostly about damage, and these three present clear unique types of damage different from physical - burn, freeze, shock. But even the designers sometimes think that something's missing in the sense of lore or aesthetics, so they shoehorn Earth in some way too, often in the form of Nature, with poison as the damage type. Sometimes it's clear that they didn't really know what to do with Earth. The first game with elemental magic I played, HoMM 5, had the spell ""Magic Arrow"" doing earth damage for some reason - probably they couldn't think of enough direct earth damage spells. What is earth damage anyway, just a stone falling on you?

So, the question: is there a place for Earth magic in fantasy games? Maybe you know games where it's implemented more interestingly than summoning a rock elemental or hitting someone with a stone? Or is there good reason to not bother with all this ""four elements"" mythology and keep things where they are, i.e. fire-ice-storm?",1

284,"To Celebrate the Launch of Diamantine, Six Sacred Swords is On Sale (US and UK Kindle Stores)Diamantine, the second book in my *Weapons and Wielders* series, is [available now on the US Kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Diamantine-Weapons-Wielders-Book-2-ebook/dp/B083P16YMR/)!

https://preview.redd.it/w6je6it01hb41.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f807c1fe3fa927159dce7e51f4b1a221e43baba2

To celebrate, the first book in the series – [Six Sacred Swords](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) – is on sale for on the [US Kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) and [UK Kindle store](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sacred-Swords-Weapons-Wielders-Book-ebook/dp/B07NKBSZGF/). (Unfortunately, those are the only regions covered by Kindle Countdown Deals. If you’re somewhere else, sorry. ;\_;)

[Six Sacred Swords](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NKBSZGF/) follows Keras Selyrian, a talented swordsman who begins a journey to seek out the titular Six Sacred Swords. It's a lighthearted adventure story, with a lot of nods to various classic games from the NES, SNES, and Playstation eras, especially *The Legend of Zelda*, *Dragon Quest*, *Ys*, and *Final Fantasy*. You might enjoy it if you're in the mood for talking swords, bibliophile dragons, and a lot of accidentally breaking traps and puzzles. The audio book version can be found [here](https://www.audible.com/pd/Six-Sacred-Swords-Audiobook/1772309117), narrated by the fantastic Nick Podehl!

This series takes place in the same universe as my *War of Broken Mirrors* and *Arcane Ascension* books.

Chronologically, the books follow this order:

· [*The War of Broken Mirrors*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/171610-the-war-of-broken-mirrors)

· [*Weapons and Wielders*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/257210-weapons-and-wielders)

· [*Arcane Ascension*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/201441-arcane-ascension)

Notably, the frame story for this book (meaning the Prologue, Interlude, and Epilogue) takes place much later than the main story, and after the second book of [*Arcane Ascension*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/201441-arcane-ascension). Reading those other books isn’t required to understand this one, but it may be beneficial to get everything possible out of the story.

Next, I’d like to mention something important about the style of this particular book.

*Diamantine* is designed to set the foundation for plot and character arcs and for several books to come, and this means that by necessity, there will be a number of elements introduced in this book that aren’t resolved by the end. This is intentional, but it may not work for all readers. If you prefer stories that feel self-contained, you may be best waiting for at least one more book to come out to read them back to back.

Thanks, everyone, and I hope you love the books!

Best,

\-Andrew",1
285,"What book or novel series would you recommend to read in the beginning part of the story but not the rest.Some people might disagree with this but for me its the divine dungeon series. Books 3 or 4 added so many subplots to the story that I almost didn't finish it. The pacing was terrible as well like the author wants to wrap it up immediately. Because of this, I haven't read book 5 yet as I lost interest.

288,"Thanks to r/fantasy I’ve just inhaled the powder mage trilogyIt was on offer on amazon for £3.99 before Christmas, and a few folk here said it was decent. I feel like I’ve robbed someone to get so much top quality book for so little.

I thought the magic system was great, and worked out well. It fits into the economy without breaking it. It also avoids the trap of becoming too pseudo-scientific.

The battle scenes are well written. I appreciated that they were written exclusively from one side, so as a reader you didn’t feel attached to the ‘losers’. It also allowed the scale to be more grand, with large scale troop losses featuring alongside individual deaths.

The biggest problem I have now is that it is finished! What should I read next? I’m relatively easily pleased but have ticked off a lot of the main series (WoT, Malazan, Farseer, all of Sanderson, Name of the Wind, 1st law, lies of Locke lamora)",1

It had an audiobook.
The magic system had to do with paintings coming alive.

292,"Some fantasy series with a heavy focus on mystery and horror?I'm not sure if what I'm looking for exists but I thought of giving it a chance.

So basically a kind of want a fantasy series that focuses heavily on mystery and horror. 

Typical medieval setting is fine but others wouldn't be a deal breaker, something like our protagonists slowly discovering and unraveling some wide spawning mystery with increasingly more dreadful and horrific implications.

Here are some of my preferences for further clarity: 

-I dislike tropes, black and white morality, excessive plot armor and so on. I much prefer a writer that wants to challenge me as a reader and that keeps me thinking after I've put down the book.

-Quality plot and world building are more important to me than quality characters, that doesn't mean cardboard cutouts are desirable it's just that I care more about getting immersed into the world and events than liking the protagonists, for example.

-Proper mystery, and specially horror mystery, is really hard to pull. I would much prefer something that slowly builds up over a long time but the clues were there all along. Not really looking for ""something is killing villagers"" and 50 pages later we see it was some random three headed monster and that's it.

If any of you are familiar with some of the secondary material from A Song of Ice and Fire relating to the really far, unexplored parts of the world with the mysterious ruins that nobody ever returns from, the strange, oily stone constructions that pop up in different places and nobody knows who made those, why or what they are, then I guess I'm kind of looking for something where the main focus gives a similar feeling without being too obvious or blatant.",1
293,"Say one thing for Steven Pacey, say he's an amazing narrator. And Joe Abercrombie a great writer part 3 (Last Argument of Kings, Spoilers).I am back again, I feel like I listened to this audiobook pretty fast. Since people seemed to like my previous posts I am back again with my thoughts about the last book in the original trilogy. Here are my thoughts about [The Blade Itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/e9fnkr/say_one_thing_for_steven_pacey_say_hes_an_amazing/), and [Before They Are Hanged](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ek3ntn/say_one_thing_for_steven_pacey_say_hes_an_amazing/) if you are curious.

So I guess this post will be about the LAOK and the trilogy as a whole since all 3 novels feel like 1 long one. Let me just say that I am satisfied with the ending, satisfied might be the wrong word actually but after thinking about it I am very glad Joe Abercrombie decided to go with this route, it is certainly a fitting ending. Let me just talk about each of the major characters for a bit, roughly ordered by how much I like them (though for example Logen is my favorite PoV in the first and third books, but I prefer Glokta and West in the second one):

**Logen:** This guy is such a villain, he really seems wise with all his catchphrases and the fact that he has seen the world. But deep down he is just a fool who continues to make the wrong choices, he is a man of violence and he cannot change his ways. The quote about The Blade Itself is about him, if it is the blade that calls for blood then all he has to do is put it down, right? Then why does he go back to the North to settle scores... Logen you really do break my heart.

It is incredibly fitting that he goes out the same way we meet him, in a way it does not even matter whether he survived, he cannot escapte being the Bloody Nine. It is easy to be fooled in the first 2 books, but when he returns home and you see how people react to him, to see him go berserk and kill his own friend and a child, well yeah that was the beast hiding underneath all along. So why do I still love him so much? Perhaps just because there is so human to how foolish he is, I genuinely think he wants to do better, it is just very hard.

My favorite use of the catchphrase was ""Say one thing for for Logen Ninefingers, say he is sneaky."" I also of course liked all the things his father used to say, and that he was never really that realistic. Since I think it is fun, [here is how I imagine Logen](https://external-preview.redd.it/0lW6sltmCg7_GeFY-fBeBS1pnXskGXSmqqM1t6rLSPY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9b7dcdf1fe6bfbd0d5202408121c520f96279bd9), [this one](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/009/930/106/large/sam-carr-sam-carr-logen-ninefingers-web.jpg?1521638021) is really good too.

**Jezal:** I have a bit less to say about him, I liked his development and how he goes from someone I hated (but thought was hilarious) to a respectable person. I think he is a fool too, but the fact that his character arc happened gives me hope in this very bleak series. I do feel really bad for his wife and her girlfriend, I hope things work out for those two.

**Glokta:** It was hard to pick who should be #3, I really do like all of them. Glokta is a huge karma houdini, he is a self pitying monster. I could not even really put into words why I like him actually, but I certainly do. His plot feels a bit disjointed from the rest, but it is certainly no less great for it. Sult is a great character, I like how he was just a bit player and didn't even realize it, Cosca is laugh out loud funny, and every scene with Glokta and Ardee was great. Ardee is great in general tbh. Glokta had the most exciting scenes in this book even if there was only 1 fight he was in (jab jab Glokta was fucking funny though). Him getting interrogated by Ferro, and having that talk with Bayaz at the end were amazing.

But I cannot just ignora the [Severard](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9a68035d6fd29f008b1047255f761ec/2bc76315e7a7df4f-4d/s1280x1920/60e6cc91d792d056e630bacc10378703ae7d842b.jpg) and Frost chapter, that really hit hard, I felt like shit while listening to it. I mean all of them present were just horrible, but the fact that their friendship comes to an end like that is just damn bleak. Feeling sorry for a character like Severard or Glokta is a strange thing indeed. As for what I make of the ending, perhaps Glokta might be able to do some good, probably not. I mean he has done a bit of good, but a lot of it was for his own self satisfaction. And the bastard is self aware enough to know that too! Damn you Glokta.

**West:** Collem is such a complicated guy, he has actually done horrible things, he clearly has issues with his anger, but he is also probably the nicest guy in the entire series (to be honest that isn't saying a whole lot). For what it is worth he strove for redemption, Ardee forgave him, he saved countless lives and the Union itself too. I would say he is a complicated man navigating though situations, and he deserved better. I just wanna say that I really enjoyed reading West chapters, his story was very engaging.

**VENGEANCE:** Not a lot to say, she seemed the least self aware of all the major characters, I am not that surprised about her ending, I never really believed she wanted to change. She was pretty damn funny at times, but I didn't find her plot very interesting in any of the books. I am pretty curious about what the community thinks of her.

**Dogman:** About the same level as VENGENACE, he provided some interesting insight, and I liked his bromance with Grim too. In fact the leader of the hillmen and Black Dow were great too. I just could not get attached to him the same way I liked the other main characters.

So now for a few plot points, **the situation in the North:** I do not think Logen is 100% to blame, Bethod was definitely deflecting all of the blame and not taking any responsiblity, when did Logen tell him to make a pact with the fucking flatheads? I am not sure if Black Dow killing Logen will lead to anything good either, the problems they are having did not come down to just 1 person, I am glad that Shivers (oh yeah, he is pretty great too I heard there is more of him in the standalones so I look forward to that) at least realized that.

**Bayaz the evil overlord:** Bayaz is an interesting one, if I had to say one thing about him it would be that he is pride personified. I will be honest, I got spoiled about his role as a villain, and if I didn't I don't think I would have seen how much of an evil bastard he is ahead of time. Having said that, the signs were all there, he was out there manipulating people and lying all along and I easily buy his hypocrisy. The other magi warned us all along too, I do feel pretty bad for Yulwei he seemed decent if way too trusting, like seriously you saw Tolomei fall first and didn't think to bring that up earlier?

**The maker's daughter:** I will be honest I have no idea how to spell her name. So I did notice last time that something was up with Quai, though I did not predict this. So just to get things clear Bayaz killed her because she knew that Kanedias did not kill Juvens? Also, she was the ghost that appeared before Logen when their room in the tower exploded (because that scene was bothering me, it would probably make sense if I listened to it again now), and it was Quai's body that was found, right?

Anyways, thank you for reading, I realize that this post has gotten pretty long (feel free to ask about anything I did not address though). As you probably noticed I quite enjoyed this trilogy, I am more than up for reading the standalones and the next trilogy as well, I will probably take a short break so I can finish other series first though. And it has gone unmentioned in this post since I feel like it is kinda implicit at this point, but damn Steven Pacey you can narrate some incredibly fine voices, what a standout performance it feels hard even to pick a favorite.",1

I made a post on another Reddit asking if anyone had written a Cultivation novel from the point of view of the Arrogant Young Master and it genuinely confused people how such a character could be the MC...despite the fact lots of heroes in the genre are rather murdery.  

You get lots of coldblooded killers as protagonists, but not a lot of snobs or embezzlers.  The moral failing of antiheroes tend to be macho ones.

299,"Charlotte Reads: Cinder Ella by S.T. Lynn*She got to define her own self. And no one was going to stop her. ""Ella,"" she said quietly.""*

Hello all! Let's talk about *Cinder Ella* by S.T. Lynn! Spoilers and discussion of transphobia follow.

**So What's It About?**

Aight, I'm not going to explain the basic premise of Cinderella to you, but what you should know for this re-telling is that Ella is trans and her stepfamily refuses to acknowledge that she is a woman. She dreams of a future where she can be acknowledged for who she really is, and when a princess invites her to the ball it seems she must decide between this dream and the new one that arises when she sees the beautiful princess...

**What I Thought**

Cinderella is not one of my favorite fairy tales but, given that the premise involves the importance of mistaken identities and transformation, I think the idea of trans Cinderella is a pretty brilliant one, and I was sold on the idea pretty much as soon as I heard about this novella. The actual execution turned out to be a bit of a mixed bag, I think, for reasons that I'll outline now.

I'm usually pretty judgmental of how the stepmother and stepsisters are handled in Cinderella retellings, but I think that in this case their characterization sheds a great deal of light on the way that women can come to hate and abuse other women who are marginalized in different ways than them, perpetuating the prejudice and oppression that they themselves experience and claim to fight against. They are by no means feminists in this story, but I think the kind of hateful rhetoric and abuse you see them hurl is exactly the kind of ""discourse"" that TERFs spew in real life - this gatekeeping of womanhood, this vitriolic hate and cruelty. The integration of transphobia into the stepfamily's treatment of Ella is very well presented in all its suffocating pain and, while it is very difficult to read about, it makes the latter part of the story even more cathartic and wonderful once Ella finds people who love and accept her.

This is the main thing I liked about *Cinder Ella* \- the underlying message that if you are trans and you are not accepted for who you are, your struggle will not always be the same. There will be people who hate you for who you are, but they will not always be the people who dominate your life: you will also meet good people, who know who you are and respect that. They will accept you unconditionally and you will know love and happiness no matter how miserable things are in the present. It's a message that needs to be shouted from the rooftops and I loved seeing it so emphatically conveyed in this story.

In this respect I think the underlying messages of love and the presentation of overcoming transphobia are this novella's strengths. It also features a number of weaknesses, and I think a few of them can be articulated by simply stating that its length does it a disservice. It would be a much stronger story as a whole if it were more fleshed out and less shallow across the board - many characters only make one or two appearances including the fairy godmother. One of the reasons I dislike Cinderella is that it always rates highly on the instalove side of the fairy tale romance spectrum unless you deliberately change several aspects of the story, as Gail Carson Levine did in *Ella Enchanted. Cinder Ella* does not do this, the romance between Liz and Ella consists of three fairly brief conversations&gt;! before the happily-ever-after.!&lt;

On a more personal note, I was disappointed that the shoe fitting part of the original tale was not incorporated here, because at one point Lynn explicitly notes that Ella is ashamed of her big feet. If Liz had found her again because the shoe only fit her it could have been an amazing inversion of the original tale and a great message - instead of being ashamed of her shoe size as an invalidation of her womanhood, it could be part of the way that she finds her happy ending!

There were a couple of other things that didn't quite sit right with me - there is clearly transphobia in this world, and at one point the stepmother tells Ella not to embarrass the family. She then promptly decides to dress up Ella in a dress and garish makeup to humiliate her at the ball, but I fail to see how she could embarrass Ella in this way without also bringing some kind of shame and judgement down upon her family as a whole. There were also a couple of moments that struck me as a little bit essentialist and reductive in this sense of ""boys do X and girls do Y and YOU do Y so therefore your womanhood is validated."" I personally identify more with the idea that anyone of any gender should be able to express themselves in any way whatsoever without their inherent sense of gender identity being cast into doubt, but I also understand the other side of the coin and why these moments were important to Ella.

300,"Prologue's in fantasy novelsAre there any fantasy books where the prologue takes place ahead in the story? Similar to how the play, Odepius Rex starts in the future and you work your way back in the story. 

I'm looking at writing a novel where the prologue starts with the main characters in prison, and then the first part of the novel is a flashback to what got them into prison and then the last half of the novel is them after getting out of prison.  My only issue is trying to figure out what happens in the middle since I already gave what happened when they where in prison. Hence looking for other novels that might have done this. 

Thanks.",1
301,"Goodreads Book of the Month Midway Discussion: Where Oblivion Lives by T. FrohockHi folks! I hope you've all been enjoying this book. T.

Without further ado, here's some information about the book, with discussion questions both in the comments and listed below. Please feel free to answer within threads, as top level comments, or create your own topics of conversation!

# [Where Oblivion Lives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40222547-where-oblivion-lives) by T. Frohock

&gt;A lyrical historical fantasy adventure, set in 1932 Spain and Germany, that brings to life the world of the novellas collected in Los Nefilim: Spanish Nephilim battling daimons in a supernatural war to save humankind.

&gt; Born of daimon and angel, Diago Alvarez is a being unlike all others. The embodiment of dark and light, he has witnessed the good and the horror of this world and those beyond. In the supernatural war between angels and daimons that will determine humankind’s future, Diago has chosen Los Nefilim, the sons and daughters of angels who possess the power to harness music and light.

&gt; As the forces of evil gather, Diago must locate the Key, the special chord that will unite the nefilim’s voices, giving them the power to avert the coming civil war between the Republicans and Franco’s Nationalists. Finding the Key will save Spain from plunging into darkness.

&gt; And for Diago, it will resurrect the anguish caused by a tragedy he experienced in a past life.

&gt;But someone—or something—is determined to stop Diago in his quest and will use his history to destroy him and the nefilim. Hearing his stolen Stradivarius played through the night, Diago is tormented by nightmares about his past life. Each incarnation strengthens the ties shared by the nefilim, whether those bonds are of love or hate . . . or even betrayal.

&gt; To retrieve the violin, Diago must journey into enemy territory . . . and face an old nemesis and a fallen angel bent on revenge.

302,"Book Management web application - Analysis StageHi everyone!

I'm a software engineer (it's relevant down the line) from Portugal and this is my first post ever on Reddit!

I'd really appreciate your opinions!

I started actively reading in 2019 and became a fantasy enthusiast like all of you (I read 14 books last year, definitely breaking records around here).   
After a few months I came across this subreddit and as they say, once you go Fantasy...

During all that reading I started using trello boards or excel spreadsheets to further enhance my experience with statistics or just to keep track of my reading/wish list.

The problem is that none of those solutions really worked for me, so in my quest (I'm so cool) to find a better solution I found out about GoodReads (I koooow, I live in a hole in the ground).

The issue I have with Goodreads is that I can't really organize stuff the way I want to, it's cool because of the community but if I want to have all kind of statistics, if I want to follow my progress in a given book, if I want to now what comes next in my reading list, etc, it just doesn't work.   
Also the user interface isn't all that friendly and sometimes it's just slow.

As an example for some of the things I want, here's a dashboard I'm using on Excel:

https://preview.redd.it/zrw59kcwtbb41.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2e4153d5d0333baf2f6b7b19170495b960c28d

https://preview.redd.it/q2h1iml6ubb41.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0c34e704f6087ffba7bfb9cf5f7f6bf1bdbf2f

https://preview.redd.it/30h7lraz2cb41.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f400d4750d40f08c61ad4a9b87edb79f60d9dfb

My trello board consists of a Reading List, Reading, Read, Year YYYY, Year ZZZZ, etc columns and I just drag books between them.

So, after reading several posts from you guys and making a small list of some of the issues you have, I made the decision of developing a web app that will help us all to better love our books. For that I'm thinking of doing something new and continuously post updates and ask for feedback during the entire process.

Here are the basics:

* **Dashboard**;All your books will be here, two different viewing modes, list and mosaic. You'll also be able to filter, add/remove books from your collection, create collections from filter results, etc.
* **Book Detail**;Product details and your reading details. It will have a progress bar (it'll show percentage, pages read, pages to go), you can also choose an option to reread the book, it will show you how many times you've read it, you can mark it as DNF, you can say if it was a gift or borrowed so you can know how much you've saved, etc.
* **Statistics**;Something similar to my Excel dashboards above, with a lot more info.
* **Reading List**;Progress bar, time it will take to complete with current reading rhythm, shuffle option to randomize the list, etc.
* **Wish List**;Wish List with all the books you want to acquire, it will also show the budget you define for a certain period of time and if you're over/under it.

So, this is an overview of what I intend to do. Interface-wise it'll be as minimalistic as possible, I don't want an information overload on my eyes.

If I can get this up and running, next in line would be to add audiobook tracking and add an option to check what your friends are reading, etc.

**Because I want your collaboration, I'd really appreciate if you would spam all functionalities you'd like to see in an application like this.**

I can't promise I'll implement everything but I think it will be interesting to see what we can achieve.

Even if nobody ends up using it, what the heck, nobody loses here. **Please, give your opinions!** Lastly, thank you for all the love you give to Fantasy.

Happy reading!",1
303,"[Review] Cursebreaker by Carol A. Park 

I totally forgot to post this here. If anyone who has been keeping up with the Heretic Gods series this was a great entry. There may be a few spoilers for the previous books (book 1 and the prequel) so read with caution.  


**A huge thank you to Carol A Park who supplied me with a copy!**

  
\*\*\*

I was really excited for this one because [***Sweetblade***](https://starlitbook.com/2019/04/25/sweetblade-by-carol-a-park/) was such a solid follow-up/prequel to [***Banebringer***](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2471706396?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1) and I was looking forward to seeing which direction **Carol A. Park** took ***Cursebreaker*** after some of the more interesting discoveries in ***Banebringer*** – particularly to do with the Blood Magic’s, Aether and its potential uses.

 \*\*\*

*The Conclave*, following the discovery of their recent actions, has dropped all pretenses and taken control of Weylyn city; even requiring blood tests to gain entry or departure to and from the city. The Conclave is positioned well – with the King bowing to them they essentially control the Setanan Army. 

*The Ichtaca* are looking for allies against their enemies and are willing to share their gifts and knowledge. Prejudices are making it difficult to gain any ground but the people are starting to see that the Conclave and its leaders are bordering on tyranny, and the “demon-spawned banebringers” may be the lesser of the two evils.

*Vaughn and Ivana* are reunited, when Vaughn seeks her help with the translation of half a book discovered in the Weylyn Library. This discovery – if it turns out to be as good as Vaughn hopes, might give them the edge they need against the Conclave and their supporters.

The translation gives Vaughn the excuse he needed to get in touch with Ivanna and it gives Ivanna a unique opportunity to dole out some retribution for some past misdeeds.

**There is a lot happening on so many levels in this story.**

**World-wise**

We are seeing the fall-out from the events in ***Banebringer***, the forces are gathering (so to speak) and it’s time to choose a side. Also, the borders are widening as we learn about some of the other cultures and gain a new character in Driskell, who plays a fairly a large role in the story.

The scope of this world felt like it grew quite a bit and even took a direction I wasn’t expecting with Vaughn and Ivanna’s findings from the translation. This added an interesting little twist to one of characters stories and the more I thought about it, the more I liked the turn.  

I did wish there was a little more to do with the magic because it is still one of the most interesting magic systems I have read. At this point there wasn’t a huge amount of impact to their discoveries about the aether. Mostly their findings were being used to help temper an alliance between the people, which is fair since this story follows fairly soon after book one and the findings aren’t widely known yet.

I had mixed feelings on the new character, Driskell. It’s not a new thing to add a character in a second book and his position as Nahua’s scribe gave us insight to some of the politics and pieces of the story that would be missing without him. In that way I didn’t mind him and getting to see more of the world view through him. But at the same time during the time getting to know him, his life, his people, etc, I kept wanting to get back to Vaughn and Ivanna or even Danton and Aleena, who I liked a lot, knew from book one, and was excited for their return. Eventually Driskell grew on me but it did take awhile.

**On a personal level – In other words ‘will they make up or won’t they’ (let’s face it,  this is the question we all want the answer to)**

Vaughn and Ivana have a lot of feelings for each other that need to be addressed and it’s a slow process because before we can get to those feelings, Ivanna especially, needs to come to terms with the regrets and anger that the decisions of a past life left her trying to bury. She has a lot of baggage she’s packing around.

Ivanna and Vaughn’s baggage is similar – both are dealing with regrets over the loss of their families (just in different circumstances) and both with feelings that they are monsters.  
There are a lot of walls that need to come down between the two and we are still trying to get across the moat but (to continue with the analogy) the bridge does seem to be in place now.

**To sum it up (because this isn’t the most cohesive review I have written – there is just so much I wanted to touch on)**

All in all, this is a good entry into the series with lots of interesting turns to the plot and some good character growth, maybe not a huge step in *relationship growth* for the two of them, but there is one and that’s a good sign.

I didn’t think this story was quite as smooth as ***Sweetblade***, but that was also a less complicated story, purely focused on Ivanna’s backstory – who the author knows very well as a character and it showed in the confident writing. You see glimpses of that confidence here but there are also moments of that careful writing too, that doesn’t feel as assured as the rest.

I’ll be curious to see how this wraps up in the next book or if it’ll take a couple to gather all the threads.

305,"Fantasy Stand Alone Recommendation for a CoupleSo I made a post a while back asking for some recommendation on fantasy novels for my girlfriend and I. We got a bunch and are adding it to our reading list. Due to my second semester of graduate school starting soon I won't have time to read any series due to the work/reading load I will have to do. So I asked my girlfriend if she wouldn't mind us reading stand alone books for the time being and she does not mind. So far we have read Good Omens, Dune, Uprooted and Spinning Silver. We loved all of them so far and enjoyed reading them and discussing them together We are looking for stand alone's that are not overtly dense in page numbers anything under 600 pages would be nice. 

She is an avid reader and doesn't mind anything. I am slowly picking up on reading again after not reading for enjoyment the past 12ish years. I also don't mind anything. We just don't want any series for the time being until the summer when I am on break.",1
306,"Racial Themes in Fantasy (and Non Euro-centric settings)This is a bit of a long shot, but bear with me please.

I'm a student currently studying speculative fiction, and I've been looking for fantasy books, films, what have you, that have a focus on race, particularly in a theme that reflects real life racial issues. Issues between white-coded dwarves and elves aren't what I'm looking for. I've discovered that fantasy had less of an emphasis on these kinds of themes as genres like science fiction do, so I've been at a loss.

I'd prefer something non Euro-centric in design, but I'm not picky. If you know of anything that even remotely matches these parameters I would love to hear about them! Thanks in advance.

308,"All the Birds in the Sky - similar books?I recently started a Malazan re-read, but I pick up other books in between each volume, as palate cleansers if you will. 

Recently I happened upon All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders and I really, really loved it. Part of its charm is that it's a short, one-off book that's not long to read and very satisfying on its own.

Another similar one that I previously read was The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman. Again, short, satisfying, very memorable. Perfect for easier reading in between the larger Malazan volumes.

The biggest problem is that i don't remember the title, the author, or the plot \*insert sad crying noises\* 

What I do remember is that it was set in medieval England. there was a character that said something like ""aye boy I am a welshman"" and one of the covers had a bunch of horsemen storming toward the reader. I think the horses may have been skeletons.  I do remember that they were obscured by mist and the whole cover was a combination of greys and other dark colors.

314,"Stories that have way more focus on the main character and the world at large than they do on interpersonal dynamics?I have a hankering for something meditative, that will let me get as much as I can into a main character's headspace and a richly-described world, but with not as much of that ""people talking to other people"" deal. 

In particular, the things that come to mind for similarities are Mushi-Shi, Walden (except without the historical context that lets me know that the author's mom did his laundry), or a story in the Malazan world told from the perspective of a Jaghut that never left their tower. IIRC there's a book about some scientist and her quest to catalog the world's dragons, and that would also be neat if I could ever find it. 

Slow paced is okay. The main things that I'm looking for are the ability to lose myself in a character and a world, plus the ability to appreciate a more contemplative, descriptive tale.",1

318,"Another In Depth Review of The Wandering InnThe Wandering Inn by Pirateaba is simply a masterpiece. It is probably the greatest fantasy series that I have ever read. After reading it, I was utterly blown away. This is what I've wanted to read all my life but wasn't able to. It does, in my view, what every fantasy series should do, but what the vast vast majority fail to do. Let us review the Wandering Inn's many strengths.

**Character Classes**

Most fantasy series revolve around combat and fighting, and most significant characters in fantasy series have abilities and jobs that revolve around combat. But fighting is such a narrow slice of life ; we can't actually live in a world where most of us fight and where life revolves around fighting. Such a world would be economically disastrous. And surely magic isn't only good for fighting.

What is beautiful about The Wandering Inn is that the two main characters, Erin and Ryoka, are not combat specialists. They have very limited combat abilities. Erin is an innkeaper and Ryoka is a runner. Much of the series is about Erin running a great inn, being a great friend, teaching people about different board games. People who are not combat specialists but ordinary shopkeepers, farmers, receptionists, barkeeps, knife sharpeners, doctors, and boat rowers get validated in a way that's rare in fantasy.

That doesn't mean that combat doesn't exist. One of the most engaging plotlines in the series is when Ryoka meets an extremely powerful witch who engages in riveting combat with people who wish her ill. This witch character is sooo unique; her abilities are so frightening and imaginative. And she is crafty and uses interesting strategies. And her story line is so complex. But Ryoka can't do much in this amazing fight; she's relevant to the story line, but in a very limited way with respect to combat. The highlight here is tangentially related to Ryoka but not her. Which is refreshing and beautiful.

**The Tempering of Wish Fulfillment**

This series does an amazing job of tempering wish fulfillment. Too many series are about the main characters growing more and more overpowered and gaining multiple love interests. Six volumes into the Wandering Inn,  it is not clear at all that the main characters have any love interest. The side characters do as love is a part of life, but the main characters don't. This is almost never done, regardless of whether there is a male or female protagonist, but here since we have a female protagonist, the absence of romance is more meaningful. Most fantasy novels starring women main characters focus heavily on their love interests; here that focus is jut not there. Romance is not used to push the narrative forward.

As previously mentioned, in high stakes situations involving violence, it's often not the main characters' combat abilities that get them out of those situations. We aren't building more and more OP combat specialists. And the way the novel focuses on many different characters and doesn't make the characters utterly independent characters serves to temper wish fulfillment in this series. Also the writer makes you care about many important characters and then kills them off. All this makes the novel more balanced and not simply a work focused on providing the audience with wish fulfillment.

**Antagonists**

Yay, we aren't fighting against one single big bad. There are several big bads we are informed about at the very beginning of the story, and several characters who might yet become big bads. Sometimes the antagonists work at cross purposes to one another. This all makes the story extremely dynamic. None of the sapient antagonists we get to know are simply evil; we learn and grow to empathize with the different antagonists. There's a witch who loves her daughter, a minotaur that teaches our protagonist how to protect herself, a goblin who simply wants to be accepted by his team, another goblin who gets a name from an enemy general, a wizard coming to terms to the fact that he was shunned by others, a species rebuilding for a certain goal. We learn their back stories. We care about them. It's beautiful.

**Social Messages**

This series is centered on one very powerful social message. Racism is bad. This is a good message. In many fantasy series, some races are naturally evil like orcs are in Lord of the Rings or Dark Elves in the Drizzt novels. This series does away with that for the sapient races. This is something that should be welcomed. Creating evil races for the purposes of making the good guys feel less guilty when they kill those races is lazy writing. Like in real life, racism is everywhere in this series, and the series addresses the different forms it can take and how pervasive racism can be. It also makes a powerful comparison between racism and other forms of unjustified discrimination - like when one of the main characters is heavily discriminated against because of his profession.

**Research/Knowledge**

This writer either does a lot of research to write this series or she has an eclectic knowledge base; she displays her knowledge of chess, go, and shogi, of military strategy, of different cultures on Earth, of medicine, and of other subjects. Do you know how hard it is to write about brilliant strategist characters in fiction and sound convincing? The challenge of writing about brilliant strategy is that the author has to think of the strategy. The author here manages to come up with brilliant strategies several times in a convincing manner. It's wonderful to see such intelligence in novels.

This series also focuses heavily on the development and expression of emotional intelligence, which is rare in fantasy series. The two main characters are a highly socially competent extrovert and someone who starts out as a reclusive introvert. Although these two characters are very different, both are convincingly portrayed.

**Killing off Important Characters**

It's one of the most frustrating things when very few of the most significant characters die in a fantasy series. Many people die in The Wandering Inn, people you grow to care about. There's a degree of realism here that's absent in a lot of novels where the highly significant good guy characters have plot armor.

**LitRPG**

Although this series is styled a LitRPG, I don't think the series depends on the game system to push the story forward. The non-RPG elements to this series are more important than the RPG elements. Additionally, the manner in which the game system is explained in this series  is highly interesting; there is actually an explanation put forward for why a non-video game world has a video game interface.

**Creativity**

The magic system is neither hard nor soft. It's not simply standard MMORPG magic and it's not not that either. The fairy magic system provokes my imagination.

The author just displays a high degree of creativity throughout the series. This is really a creative work. It has some derivative elements, but the amount of original creativity in this series left me breathless. It sometimes makes me wonder whether the author is even human. It's just creativity is hard, and having read as many fantasy novels as I have, I really don't expect the amount of creativity from fantasy writers that the author of this fantasy series displays.

**Point of View**

The story is told from many people's point of view. These points of view are often richly outlined, and there's a lot of difference in how different characters' POV are written. This adds a degree of majesty, beauty, and realism to the series.

There are several chapters dedicated to talking about what it is like being a doctor in a warzone -- something I was really struck by. It's not something I expect from fantasy.

**Conclusion:**

The Wandering Inn is the Anna Karinina of fantasy. Although it's a web novel series, I can confidently say that it is better than most of the published fantasy series you can find in bookstores. There is balance, creativity, grace, and intelligence in this series that is stunning. What craftsmanship.",1

322,"Why I'll likely never be able to get into the Malazan seriesThere's no particular reason or deep meaning behind this thread. I just need to get these thoughts out after giving this series a second chance, first by trying to read the first book, and trying to get into the second book again in audiobook form. Neither went well. Previously I'd read Gardens of the Moon, and about 80% of Deadhouse Gates. After this I feel I have a fundamental, philosophical disagreement with the reasons this series seems to be praised, and what I find bewildering is how this series seems to get a pass on things that would be heavily criticized anywhere else. To Malazan fans these complaints will likely be just ""more on the pile"", so take that as you will.

1. To quote Yahtzee Croshaw's review of Final Fantasy 13: ""I've been told Final Fantasy 13 gets good about 20 hours in. You know that's not a point in its favor, right?"" The same IMO can be applied to this seemingly prevailing notion that the series only gets really good on one's second reading. I'm sorry, but just no. If I give a series about 1500 hundred pages and literal weeks of my time, I should be finding some enjoyment or reason to continue after that, not after four or five times that amount. This overlaps with several other issues I have with the first two books, starting with...
2. Throwing around a zillion names and terms and not explaining them doesn't make the world mysterious, it makes it incomprehensible. This is one of the main reasons why I found the the books so hard to get into. This is especially compounded in audiobook form, when you don't know how things are supposed to be spelled, some of the terms sound like regular words (""D'ivers"" vs ""divers"" for example) and you can't flip back to go check. I'm not against this concept entirely: ASOIAF starts with describing ""Others"" only visually, not explaning what they are. I'll say that the opening chapter of Deadhouse Gates is actually very effective, and uses this technique just right to hit the sweet spot: giving the reader hints of a larger picture while staying focused enough to be engaging. But Erikson can't seem to help himself: he has to go balls deep, 220% all the time to get every single idea of his out there, whether it matters to the plot or not. I'd be listening to a chapter of the second book and realize I hadn't known what anything was supposed to be going on for the last 5 minutes, because it felt about 1/3 of the words had just been various terms and names so it sounded it was written in some gobbledygook alien language.
3. No descriptions on what anything looks like. This is more of a problem with the first book than the second, but considering it's supposed to be an introduction to this universe IMO it deserves a special kicking for it. This is one of the most baffling aspects about ""Gardens"" for me. I know it was originally written as a screenplay, but *boy fucking howdy* is it badly turned into a book. To give a couple of examples: in the beginning when Sorry is captured, we're told that one of the guys is suddenly surrounded by ""seven massive Hounds"". That's about all the description you get. Later we find out that apparently these seven hounds slaughtered an entire village with ease. So were these, like, elephant-sized hounds? Special demonic hounds? Was Hound just a term used for something else entirely? Another example: ""...a Kenryll'ah demon arose beneath Nightchill. Laughing shrilly, the towering, gaunt creature tore Nightchill limb from limb... Bellurdan... closed his hands around the demon's head and crushed it."" So this creature is supposedly ""towering"", but its head is small enough to be closed around by human hands? So its anatomy is all weird or something? Or did ""towering"" in this case mean at most like 9 feet tall? Or was Bellurdan turned into a giant with magic? These are just minor examples that ultimately don't matter in the story, but *everything* is like this: terms and names thrown around willy-nilly without context or even description, and what little description there is only makes things more confusing. This way I can't even try to focus on the moment and worry about the bit politics behind everything later. I can't even get into the characters, because their appearance is described like 3 times total in the book, and even then in the most oblique way possible. At least in ASOIAF I'm constantly reminded of how everyone looks, and can therefore get into their head more easily.
4. To paraphrase another critic I like, YMS: ""A movie should be so good that you want to find all the subtleties in it. Not only good if you *can* find all the subtleties in it."" The same can be IMO applied to books: If the only way to find enjoyment in a series is to slog through mountains of incomprehensible gibberish on the promise that something that seems meaningless now will pay off 3 books down the line, then I don't think that series is particularly enjoyable. This goes back to point #1. I just find it so curious that Malazan seems to get a special exemption from this kind of thing. Being all setup (which is how I've heard ""Gardens"" be described) is not a story. I'm all for long-term planting and payoff, but that can't be all there is. I don't remember if anyone in ""Gardens"" even has an arc. Apsalar in a way I guess, but nothing else sticks out.
5. When everyone is special, no one is. The capabilities and power levels are another aspect where this world is confusing to the point of madness. In the opening chapters of ""Gardens"" we see that mages are essentially walking nukes, and can seem to blow entire armies to bits by just farting at them. In the opening chapters of ""Deadhouse"" we're told how Crokus and co. come across this giant badass sea centipede that can crush entire ships. And mere paragraphs later they just blow its head off with what's apparently an exploding crossbow bolt. So if they had such an easy way of getting rid of it the whole time, why bother with all this buildup? They don't even say something like ""Well, that was the last one. We have to stay unseen from now on"". So if mages can kill companies of soldiers by sneezing at them, and giant sea monsters can be taken care of with one carefully aimed crossbow bolt, why should I care for any military conflicts that go on, or be afraid for the characters?
6. Kruppe. On my second read of ""Gardens"" I stopped before he even showed up, but I remember thinking ""This is what Jar Jar Binks must have felt like for people the first time round"" when reading the first time. He was insufferable.
7. Finally, I *fucking hate* the bit in the preface of ""Gardens"" where Erikson essentially says ""If you don't get this book you might be a dummy dumb dumb and I refuse to think otherwise"" No. Your story failed, in one way or another, to properly introduce the world it's in, and the fact that Deadhouse Gates' prologue does a better job at that than the entirety of ""Gardens"" is IMO testament to that. \[**Edit: Okay, I was a bit agitated and sleep-deprived while writing this post, so this point doesn't really stand up to scrutiny. The preface comes across more as Erikson refusing to admit fault in ""Gardens"" or that it could be vastly improved with basic edits. It doesn't come across as condescending, but still smug.**\]

\[**Edit #2: Edited the language to be directed more at the work than the creator to allow this discussion to continue. The original was harsh and impolite, and I believe in owing up to one's mistakes and fostering a more civil atmosphere. Also, this is my most commented Reddit post ever  and my first gold, which I certainly didn't expect, so thanks everybody**\]

Glad to have that out of my system. If you feel the same way, join the hate. I was thinking of making a joke about this being the Dark Souls of book series (in a negative way), but even that's not true: in Dark Souls you at least can enjoy the combat system and the visuals right from the outset even if you have no idea about anything else. Malazan doesn't even have that.",1
323,"What is your maximum level of Fantasy?I've recently been trying to read a lot of the top 10 kinds of fantasy series and after having finished a few books from ASoIaF, Kingkiller Chronicles, First Law, Malazan, WoT, Stormlight and Gentlemen Bastards, it seems like the actual amount of crazy magic doesn't matter as long as the story is good.

**What I Thought (Story By Story)**

**Gul by Shreya Ila Anasuya** \- this one tells a beautiful but sorrowful story of enduring love between two courtesans, &gt;!one of whom is immortal.!&lt; I especially appreciated the way the history of British colonialism was interwoven into the story, exploring the impact of British occupation and violence on courtesans' experiences. 4/5 stars.

**Gandaberunda by S.V. Sujantha** \- a girl who &gt;!ate her twin in the womb commits serial killings of men with the help of the twin. !&lt;This one was quite creepy, and I think I would have found it more interesting  if it had delved into how they &gt;!selected the men to murder - the one that they killed in the story was a would-be rapist, but I wasn't sure whether the other men they had killed were also selected for similar reasons. !&lt;In any case the main motive seemed to be plain and simple robbery as opposed to any kind of misandrist vengeance (I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it might have been interesting). 3/5 stars.

**Rulebook for Creating a Universe by Tashan Mehta** \- this is a story of the beings responsible for creating universes, and one girl in particular who does not follow the gendered prescriptions of her society. It's a story of women who choose not to follow the rules that are made for them, their punishment for action and resistance and the beauty of what comes from that resistance. This might be my favorite of the collection; it was beautifully written. 5/5 stars.

**The Demon Hunter's Dilemma by Samhita Arni** \- a demon hunter learns that she has been manipulated by her mentor and that not all demons are monsters. This is a great premise but I think it suffers for being communicated in a short story format &gt;!\- the main character just falls in love so easily and changes her mind about her mentor so quickly.!&lt; I would have enjoyed this story much more if her internal process of change had been more fleshed out. 2/5 stars

**Earth and Evolution Walk into a Bar by Sejal Mehta** \- Mother Earth fights back against human depredations by giving women and children monstrous powers, and when Evolution tries to stop her she decides to &gt;!end suffering once and for all. !&lt;The story features an examination of the relationship between humans violating other humans and the ways that humans violate the earth as well as a reflection on the false logic of humans being ""more evolved"" than other creatures. 3/5 stars.

**Tridevi Turbulence by Trisha Das** \--the goddesses discuss the current state of the world, and decide to see how humans do when they can no longer take the river Ginga/Ganges for granted any longer. I appreciated the continuation of the theme of nature's exploitation and how it relates to human violence, but I struggled to keep the goddesses straight. I think this one might be a lot easier for someone who has previously familiar with the Hindu gods and goddesses.  3/5

**Stone Cold by Kiran Manral** \- a story of lesbian desire in a dystopian future where touch is forbidden. Unfortunately, I felt like most of this story was occupied with info-dump exposition about the dystopian future without much of anything happening plot or character-wise. 2/5 stars.

**The Gatekeeper's Intern by Ruchika Roy** \- a woman finds meaning in her work in the afterlife. There are some interesting ideas about the balance between  chaos and peace/good and bad but, similarly  to the previous story, I felt like most of it was just exposition about how Roy's version of the afterlife functioned and it struggled to keep my interest. 2/5 stars.

**Grandma Garam's Kitty Party by Shweta Taneja** \- a chudail (a backwards-footed demon that preys on men) fights her family's expectations for her by deciding to ""go straight"" and no longer prey on humans. This one was absolutely hilarious  - for instance, I'm in awe of Taneja's decision to have the chudails encounter a foot fetishist, and all of the chudails were delightfully horrible. 5/5 stars.

**The Carnival a the Edge of the Worlds Shveta Thakrar** \- a retelling of the romance of Nala and Damayanti (told in the Mahabharata) with enchanted puppets and an interdimensional circus. The sheer inventiveness of that premise alone makes this one stand out.  3/5 stars.

**The Rakshasi's Rose Garden by Sukanya Venkatraghavan** \- listen, I will never get tired of stories of &gt;!vengeful women punishing predatory men with their transformative magic.!&lt; It's simply Charlotte catnip. Compared to characters from history and myth that follow this pattern before her, Ari is a beautifully-written character and this one certainly stood out from the pack. 5/5 stars.

**Bahameen by Amsa Kazi** \- this one is about time hoppers who lose their memories of living on previous worlds? I THINK? I'm not going to lie to you, I had absolutely no idea what was happening the whole time. I considered re-reading this one to see if I would understand it better a second time, but ultimately I decided that, having read it once already, nothing about it particularly indicated that reading it again would be a rewarding experience.  1/5, with the caveat that it's probably just because I'm too dumb to understand it.

**The Girl Who Haunted Death by Nikita Deshpande** \- this is a retelling of  Savitri’s story from the Mahabharata, where the journey to bring her husband back to life changes what she wants in the first place after she comes to know Death firsthand. Savitri is known as the epitome of a faithful, dedicated wife and I really appreciated that this story gave her dimmensionality and complex motivations and emotions. 4/5 stars.

**Apocalyptica by Krishna Udayasanka**r - the goddesses conspire &gt;!to bring about the apocalypse by awakening Bhumi, Mother Earth!&lt;. This one also highlights the parallels between human violence and the destruction of the earth - really it's so bizarrely similar to *Earth and Evolution Walk into a Bar* as they both explore these themes and feature deities &gt;!bringing about the apocalypse!&lt;. 3/5.

Every story in this collection meditates upon feminism in one form or another, from the forms of violence that women are disproportionately subjected to and the actions that we may take in response to this to a reclamation of famous female myths and monsters, giving them new complexity and agency all their own. Some of the stories are deeply angry, others hopeful and thoughtful, but all of them left me with a sense of urgency and empowerment. It's a special collection, and one that I'm very glad to have read.

325,"Looking for chill sci-fi adventureHey all!

I've recently read a lot of fantasy, and thought I'd read some sci-fi next.

As title indicates, I'm looking for *chill* sci-fi adventure. 

I usually do my reading just before going to sleep, so I don't want to read something that'll keep me awake when I stop reading. With that I mean for an example no complex intrigues that will keep my head spinning when I turn off the light. Not too dramatic or tragic, since I don't want to sleep with negative emotions.

Romance - I can take it or leave it, as long as it's not too angsty or dramatic. I don't want thoughts of *will they, won't they*, or of how much of an asshole the protagonist is cause he cheated on his space girl when I'm trying to sleep.

I usually prefer adventure stories rather than more military or politically oriented. 

I haven't read too much sci-fi. Off the top of my head, I've read the Red Rising trilogy, Ender's Game, The Reckoners, and I started reading The Lost Fleet.

So basically I'm looking for books to get me in the mood for dreams of sweet adventures in space, while not being complex or dramatic enough to keep my brain in high gear and thus instead preventing sleep!",1

The Shadow of What Was Lost - 33 instances
An Echo of Things to Come - 21 instances
The Light of All That Falls - 25 instances

329,The Wounded Kingdom TrilogySo I randomly heard of this novel trilogy and decided to pick it up.  It was just AMAZING.  Holy balls...  The first two books were great but man King of Assassins was just unbelievable. It left my mouth hanging on the floor so so many times and I just have to say if you're on the fence of reading this....  It will be absolutely worth your time,1
330,"Book Review (spoilers): Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn MuirWhere to start with this book?  The tag line of “lesbian necromancers in space” is maybe a good starting place. The character of Gideon, while physically strong and empowering is also meek compared to the necromancer that she must protect. Oh yeah, she also wears face paint, has red hair, wears aviators and has dirty magazines.  It totally makes sense.  Other reviews I have seen for this book is that the first half is slow and plodding which I mostly agree with.  The beginning of the novel is fun but once they change locations it becomes cumbersome to try and learn 20 new characters simultaneously especially since you don’t know the two main characters well enough yet. The book is riddled with teenage humor and sarcasm which actually is appreciated because it helps cut the tension in some areas. It’s the equivalent of a space fantasy mixed with science fiction mixed with horror mixed with mystery mixed with comedy put into a blender and pulsed for 90 seconds. Somehow it works. The second half of the novel is great and is a sprint in trying to figure out what was happening.  Overall, rate it 4/5 and look forward to the sequel (which I won’t state the name of it because it’s kind of a spoiler). What did you think?",1
331,"Yet another request for book recommendationFirst off--sorry y'all.  I see tons of these too.  Hoping this one is a bit different.

I think I'm basic.  I enjoy a likeable mc, epic where the good guys win, no loveable characters die story.  Also potentially important--I'm pretty exclusively audiobooks.

I really loved RP1, and enjoy a lot of the LitRPG genre.  My favorite series of recent is Super Powereds.  I've given a legit shot to a lot of the more popular books mentioned here (Wheel of Time, some Brandon Sanderson, etc), but most I either quit after a few hours listen or did not like enough to continue a series.  I just feel bored with them like not much is going on.  Currently almost done with Book 2 in the Reckoners series and like it but don't love it.

Am I just a basic enthusiast that can't appreciate depth?It's cool if the answer is yes, I'm just trying to find more to read.  If it helps for background, my one true love is classic RPG video games like A Link to the Past, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, etc.

Thanks in advance",1
332,"Trying to get back into reading, looking for book recommendations. (more details in post)As the title says, I'm trying to get back into reading -- I plan on writing stories of my own, and if writing is exhaling, reading is inhaling. Would prefer longer stories, so I have more content to go through, but I'm open to shorter tales.

Taste-wise, I'm a sucker for classics: knights in shining armor slaying evil emporers, magic swords shrouded in myth and legend, wizards who are as powerful as they are mysterious, ancient evils that would destroy the world would they be unsealed... tropes that many deride for being cliche, even harmful at times, yes, but I love them all the same. I'm not going to read dollar bin books to get my fix, though -- particularly with regard to some of the more harmful ones (*cough cough* damsels in distress *cough cough*), having a strong execution is key.

With the above in mind, any suggestions on what I should add to The List^tm ?

333,"Looking for werewolf/shifter stories that focus on world building and action rather than romanceI guilty pleasure of mine has always been themes around human vs animal psyche. A man wrestles with his humanity while being a beast, ect...

What I don't find enjoyable is the absolute saturation of werewolf/shifter novels that centre completely around romance. Like, here's this whole cool society of wolf people, but it's not actually relevant to the plot because 'Steve loves Mary' and that's the only driving force behind the narrative. Worse than that the only conflict these characters have with their animal side is that it makes them horny for eachother.

334,"Gap Cycle (spoilers book 1 and 2), questionsI just finished book 2 and I'm at something of an impasse.

I thought the writing of book 1 (Gap into Conflict) was great. In fact, the entire book was great. Probably the darkest book I've ever read, but very powerful.

Then I read book 2, as one does, and now I'm conflicted. The writing seemed OK but it seems like Donaldson has a overriding fixation on rape. Both main characters, Morn and Angus, are primarily motivated by rape and other forms of abuse. The plot seems to required torture and rape to move forward at every turn. The backstory of both are built on tragedy and abuse.

At some point it stopped being powerful and just became predictable and tiresome.

My conflict is that I enjoy the world building and the plot. There's a lot of interest in the universe and I want to find out more. There's intrigue behind the Angus story, and the aliens are cool. 

But I think I'm going to have to stop if every time the plot needs to move forward someone needs to get repeated rapped, abused, and tortured.

 I'm hoping someone can tell me that this kind of thing stops... Does it?",1

340,"One Mike to Review Them All: Spindle’s End by Robin McKinleyRobin McKinley does a lot of fairy tale retellings, though with *Spindle’s End* she’s branching out a bit and doing a retelling of something other than *Beauty and the Beast* (which she’s done at least 3). The thing about fairy tale retellings is that either it’s different enough to lose that comforting familiarity, or else it’s not different enough and it’s perfectly predictable. *Spindle’s End* manages to split that difference perfectly: I never lost track of the fact that I was reading a retelling of *Sleeping Beauty*, and yet McKinley still kept me guessing literally up through the epilogue.

And through all of this, the book was (unexpectedly) funny as hell.

Y’all know the premise: kingdom is delighted to welcome the daughter of the King, fairy godmothers bestowing blessing, wicked fairy bestowing a pre-industrial-textile-manufacturing-equipment-based curse, princess spirited away to hiding, grows up not knowing her identity, curse to strike on her 18th birthday, etc. All of that happens.

The thing about *Sleeping Beauty* is that you really can’t tell the whole story from the princess’s perspective - after all, she’s a newborn at the beginning, and newborns generally don’t have that much of an internal monologue. So McKinley’s solution here is to make the protagonist for the first half of the book Katriona, a teenaged fairy who manages to (accidentally) bestow an additional blessing on little Rosie (as they call her), and then is press-ganged into being the one to take and raise the baby in secret, along with her older, more experienced fairy aunt. (Fairies, in this context, are more or less villagers like everyone else, but with some additional magical talents and effects. Sometimes more annoying than useful.)

So we get Katriona’s perspective for the first half of the book, with a gradual transition to Rosie’s perspective as she grows into her teenage years. Katriona’s a great character: warm, befuddled, and in over her head.

Rosie herself is (in the tradition of Robin McKinley protagonists) intelligent, willful, determined, and not particularly pretty. (All the fairy godmothers, in blessing the baby with things like “hair like gold” and “skin like milk”, never thought to bless her with “a pretty face.” Her hair is gorgeous (though she hates the ringlets and keeps it short), and her complexion is very fair (so she burns after about 10 seconds of sun and everyone knows when she’s feeling any strong emotion), but her face is rather plain).

Rosie’s life growing up is delightful to read - McKinley does a truly wonderful job with it. I give her credit for actually working in the woodland-creatures-flocking-around-her in a way that actually makes a degree of sense.

Things change as Rosie approaches her 18th birthday, and finds out her heritage. Katriona and her aunt have been working this entire time to arrange matters so Rosie can evade the curse, but the wicked fairy is powerful, and they know the danger is very real. The back half of the book just *crackles* with tension in the lead-up to Rosie’s birthday. This was the kind of book that is just exhausting to read, what with the tense muscles and accelerated heart rate and all.

I don’t want to reveal much, but while the expected Handsome Prince does in fact appear, it’s not in a way I expected. And no prince is coming in at the eleventh hour to save the damsel in distress, thank you very much - Rosie is the heroine of this story, and there’s no snoozing-until-molested-awake going on here.

I generally adore Robin McKinley, and this is a book that needs more attention. Highly, highly recommended.

As far as Bingo goes, this works for the retelling square.",1
341,"Recommendation (?) Request - ""Annoying"" Comic Relief CharactersSo, this might be a bit of a weird request.

I haven't seen or read *The Witcher* as of yet, but through the power of the internet, I've learned about Jaskier/Dandelion, which renewed my curiosity about this kind of character - the very clearly defined comic relief in your standardish Medieval European Fantasy story, that is considered annoying by other characters and/or the audience, and essentially exists to prove the moments of levity.  Being a bard seems to help, but not be necessary.

The reason for my curiosity is I got the sense from Brother Longfoot in *The First Law* that this was a specific character type, which is deconstructed in that series through the annoyance being played up.  I also got this understanding from The very meta novella, ""Spiderlight"", where one character, your standard rogue/thief, is pretty clearly defined as ""the one there to make annoying jokes"".

One of the few straight example I'm familiar with is Fflewddur Fflam from *The Book of Three* (incidentally a bard).  The other would be Moongloom from *The Elric Saga*, who I would assume inspired Jaskier, since Elric himself inspired Geralt.

Are there other notable examples of this character type?",1

This is the third and final book in Joe Abercrombies First Law trilogy. A great Grimdark fantasy series with incredible characters and a fully realised harsh world.

344,"[Major spoilers] Question about plot point in The Burning White (Lightbringer #5)So I just finished The Burning White a couple days ago, and there's one point I'm confused about. Major spoilers ahead...

In the Andross flashback chapters, Andross and Felia get in a fight because Andross seduced and slept with a young lady. I don't recall whether it was explicitly stated, but I'd inferred that the woman was Kip's mother. Further, the timing of the fight (""18 years ago"") would match up well with Kip's birth (I'm not sure how old he is in this final book, but 17-18 sounds reasonable).

So I was fully expecting a reveal that Andross, not Gavin (or Dazen), was Kip's real father. But that reveal never came. I think it was even reinforced that Gavin (not sure which one) was Kip's father.

So... Am I just way off base here? Was that an intentional red herring? Am I missing something obvious? (I have a terrible memory)",1
345,"Finally read the 'Mage Errant' series by John Bierce. It relies on old, familiar tropes, but executes them superbly.This has been on the to-read list for a while.  It seemed to push all my buttons and was frequently recommended, so I was excited to finally get to it.  But now I have Thoughts, long enough to warrant a full write-up here.


**Plot**

A few pages into the first book, the first thing you notice are the tropes.  The opening half is crammed with the things — but personally I think it works!  The story feels familiar, even well-worn at times, but never gets stale.  A good story is a surprising one and a good surprise needs setup.  (Past the first book the setting zooms out a bit and starts to feel much more exotic and original.)

It helps that the plotting is absolutely masterful.  At their core, these are adventure-mystery stories.  (About a boy wizard in a magic school...  the obvious comparison is obvious.)  Every instalment is satisfying and self-contained, with only the gentlest of hooks at the end.  And despite the familiar trappings, the plot stays twisty the whole way through, with multiple 'reveals' at the end of each book.  Some you see coming, others you don't, but it's always a delight to read.

And as the story winds along, it never feels rushed, nor too self-indulgent (leaving aside the occasional moment of ""let me explain, Watson"").  There must have been a ruthless editor behind the scenes, because these books were more balanced and better-paced than most trad-published fiction.

**Setting**

The approach to setting is even more meticulous.  The world is diverse and wild and a bit nuts, but you slowly come to see how it makes sense.  With many different 'attunements' and other moving pieces, the 'hard' magic system is a lot of fun, though at times a little airy on the specifics.  We learn about most of this in dribbles, as the scope slowly zooms out.  This is absolutely the right approach, because when we get an infodump instead, the narrative grinds to a stop.

Bierce has an ability to sketch in a few words the key details of a scene or character.  I can still imagine a few scenes and characters quite vividly (the Grand Library and the Labyrinth in particular), thanks to the memorable imagery and succinct description.  But one minor thing that PISSED me off: the use of imperial units.  When Kanderon's wings are described as '75 feet wide' or the dragon '600 feet long', it stops me cold while I do the conversion.  As a reader, I'm much more used to natural comparisons.

**Characters**

For me, this is where the books go from 'great' to 'good', unfortunately.  I found it hard to get swept away by the story and the world when many of the characters feel fake and lacking.

I think the biggest issue comes early on — our introduction to the deuteragonists, Talia and Sabae, is *extremely* clumsy.  As soon as we meet them, an entire of chapter of exposition is devoted to their backstories.  This has a profound chilling effect.  They become unfamiliar AND uninteresting, robbed of any mystery or ambiguity.  They redeem themselves, very slowly, through sheer over-exposure — by the end of the third book I found them ...tolerable.

(And similarly: what is even the point of Godrick?  For such a major character, he seems to be complete dead weight.  At least Avah is important to Hugh and plays a small role at the end of book 3 — you could remove Godrick without affecting the story at all.  I don't even know why he was brought along in book 2!)

There are other things that make it hard to like the characters.  The dialogue is serviceable but lacking individual character voice.  The lighter character interactions all feel a bit scripted and corny, lacking the awkwardness and vulgarity of real teenagers.  Even the jokes fall a bit flat.  The author's brevity and imagery, which worked so well with the setting, fails us here.  For instance, did you know Talia is a fire-attuned and likes to fight?  You can tell because she's short and red-haired, as the story lets you know.  Repeatedly.

**Overall**

I came in expecting Rowling, but quite a bit more Sanderson — with all the positives and negatives that implies.  The series so far is easy to love and a really fun read.  But the tedious side characters and slightly wooden interactions meant I was never totally sold.  Nonetheless, I fully expect to devour Book 4 when it comes out.",1
346,"The English translation of The Witcher...So, I've been reading The Last Wish, and the prose has (imho) the weirdest tone to it.

A little bit awkward-forced-jollity, a sense of... not exactly over-formality, but you'd swear he doesn't use enough contractions, or it was written by C3PO, or he's going to start calling everyone 'fellow' or... *something*.

I don't speak any Polish at all, so I couldn't begin to compare it with the original; is the translator going for a kind of archaic feel?

The thing is, the effect feels familiar, from other translated works, like *A Journey to the West*. Which, come to think, is also folklore.

**60. The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins (46 on the 2019 list)**

&gt;Carolyn is one of 12 children adopted by Father, an all-powerful god-like figure who presides over a library filled with magical tomes that comprise all magical knowledge in the universe. When Father is unexpectedly murdered, Carolyn and the others must uncover the culprit and figure out who could possibly kill the all-mighty Father and how they can possible survive such a villain's machinations, let alone defeat this unseen opponent.

China Mieville often earns praise as perhaps the weirdest fantasy writer out there but I've always felt that at the end of the day, his stories were actually mostly normal at their core with only a patina of weirdness on top. Sure, Perdido Street Station has cactus people but they're not super prevalent and the meat of the story is mostly a straightforward kaiju adventure. But here, this book, Library at Mount Char, this is a marvelously weird book from beginning to end. From the all powerful godlike Father who is both both unspeakably cruel and endlessly benevolent to the various spirits who alternately guide or antagonize the core cast to the children themselves who are so estranged from their humanity that they may as well be aliens without any basic concepts of things like dignity or companionship or kindness, this book delivers some of the strangest scenarios you can come across in a book that's still mostly easy to follow.

There are many twists that I never saw coming but incredibly, they all make sense by the end. We see Father in his alternating brutality and kindness, how he neglects the children unless it's to train them as successors, and you begin to understand fully just how damaged they all are from the sociopath David who terrorizes his peers to the hollowed-out Margaret who has spent so much time in death and the world between life and death that she has lost all emotion and connection to the living. It's hard to speak to the best parts of the book without spoilers and as you can see below, I'm going to have a block of them soon, so I'll try to hit what I can without spoilers up here. The themes of the book eventually come down to learning how to replace powerful figures and that the monsters that we face are what teach us to be truly strong which I appreciate as a theme (though I have some quibbles with how it was implemented). The universe is fascinating with, you guessed it, a giant library that holds all of the mystical knowledge of the universe with each child who lives there trying to master a separate section of the library. Of course, it's not like a normal training course because Father is a brutal task master who teaches his students by killing them repeatedly and then bringing them back to torture them in increasingly specific ways in order to bring them to heel. This creates some unique tension and there's a lot of stuff in there earlier in the book that deals with the subject of abusive relationships. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are also quite a few hilarious moments throughout the book such as the title of chapter 7, perhaps one of my favorite in all of fantasy: *About Half a Fuckton of Lying-Ass Lies*. How can you not love that?

The main flaw that I imagine putting people off is that there are a few major scenes of sexual assault. But a potentially bigger flaw, I would venture, is that the thematic underpinning may come from a somewhat questionable place. The story reveals itself to ultimately be about &gt;!Carolyn being unknowingly groomed to take Father's place and all of the brutalities and injustices she suffered were tests to make sure she was truly strong enough to shoulder the burden of taking care of the universe. This reveal, that Father is actually benevolent and regretted doing what he had to do to make Carolyn strong, did raise my eyebrow since his teaching tools included every type of abuse imaginable from meticulous torture to rape. I don't think it's a bad general theme to show that people rise to the level of the challenges they are forced to face but to show a supposedly and ultimately good character enacting such brutality does strike me as a bit questionable. This is essentially the classical ""Problem of Evil""; how can an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving deity permit evil in the world? The answer, as posited by the book, sort of comes out to ""he had to inflict evil on you both directly and indirectly, it was for your own good. It was an opportunity for personal growth."" Hmmm. Now it is clear that Father is not all-knowing, all-powerful or all-loving (though he is implied to be pretty damn close) so he does chalk some of this up to making mistakes but I still think there was a way to do a ""the monsters we face are what make us strong"" theme without having the monsters come from a supposedly kind caretaker. That's not to say it shouldn't happen at all, only that I think it was a mistake to have Carolyn treat him so positively and affectionately at the end. I think a little more distance and ambivalence considering what he'd put her through would have been more appropriate. The more Dumbledore-esque ending where she admires his mentorship seemed a bit off. Put another way, I think this could have been rewritten slightly to better address the surviving abuse aspect of the story that the book kind of fumbles the landing on.!&lt; Apologies for the wall of spoiler text.

Those niggling questions aside though, I do think this is a powerhouse of a book that really cements itself as one of the most original and interesting books I've ever read. Chock full of personality and humor in an otherwise extremely dark tale, I think everyone should give it a shot.

* **Why is this a top novel?** Wonderfully weird, fun to read, and full of unpredictable twists.
* **Do you wish there was a sequel?** Hmm, I don't know where the story could go from here but I'm definitely intrigued to see what book Hawkins comes up with next. I'll tentatively say: this book doesn't need a sequel but if a sequel came out, I'd be there to read it.

**56. Nine Princes in Amber by Roger Zelazny, Book 1 of the Chronicles of Amber (63 on the 2019 list)**

&gt;Carl Corey is a mental patient undergoing electroshock therapy to help with his memory loss until he escapes and meets a mysterious woman, Flora. She reveals that she is his sister and that he is a Prince, Prince Corwin of Amber which is the only real world in the universe and which all else is merely a shadow of. With the help of his brother, Random, Corin sets out to return to Amber and find out why he was left on earth without memories and what is happening since another of his brothers has usurped the throne.

Nine Princes in Amber was one of the first books I was recommended when I first started up with r/Fantasy and while there were other books I tackled first (we'll get to you in a few months, Powder Mage trilogy), it remains one of the earliest series I actually went out and bought on recommendation. It, and the series that follows, is one of the most singular works of epic fantasy ever produced. This books just does things you don't see a lot of fantasy do and that certainly no one was doing at the time of its release. From the modern tone with a character who, while still being from a noble family who has magical powers, is a pretty recognizably modern character and speaks like an average person rather than in a pastiche of what we think middle English sounded like. The story is astoundingly short, under 200 pages, but still manages to pack in a ton of worldbuilding and magic into its short run. The focus too is not on major battles or grand quests (though those elements do show up in later books) but in a small personal journey to regain memory and then a a larger plot of dealing with dysfunctional family. And okay, there is a major battle but it's one based off  of pettiness and it does not go well for anyone involved whether they be the victors or the vanquished.

Now a lot of the things I listed could probably double as negatives for people. I know I've seen more than one person get fed up with Corwin's references to modern things and I'd be lying if I said the occasional dated late 60s/early 70s slang that made it's way into the book doesn't throw me for a loop at times. I think a more serious issue though is that, as the quest focuses on Corwin recovering his memory, much of this book can feel like it's figuring the plot out as it goes since things will happen to Corwin, the significance of which he (and you) won't understand until much later in the book and sometimes won't even understand until later books. It can be a frustrating way to read a novel when it's just stuff happening and you don't always know why. I think this book handles it fairly well but every once in a while the number of events that occur without explanation can really pile up.

However it truly is a unique work that I enjoy greatly. The quick pacing makes up for pretty much any other problems this story has in my view. It can be read in an afternoon and the other books are just as quick and delightful. The themes of dysfunctional families and the echoes of Arthurian myth are also worth noting and I enjoy them though I feel they are the least prevalent in this book and don't really come into their own until the sequels.

* **Why is this a top novel?** Inventive and unique, well-paced, with a bunch of memorable characters.
* **Would you continue on?** I already have, I even took the opportunity from rereading this book to finally finish up the whole series.

**56. Under Heaven by Guy Gavriel Kay, Book 1 of the Under Heaven series (98 on the 2019 list)**

&gt;Sheng Tai has spent two years mourning the death of his father by burying thousands of unburied soldiers by himself in a pass between two great empire, the nation of Tagur and his own home nation of Kitai. To thank him for his work, the Tagurans gift him 250 of the most coveted horses in the world, immediately marking Tai as an important man who will be sought for political favors. What Tai does with these horses will shape the future of the Kitai empire if he can figure out how to survive the unknown assassins who have been sent against him by an unknown rival.

As discussed with Sailing to Sarantium last month, Guy Gavriel Kay is one of my favorite fantasy writers so it should be completely unsurprising that I greatly enjoyed this book too. As always, the prose is excellent, the historical situations he draws inspiration from are fascinating, and the world is unique and riveting. The book opens with the main character Sheng Tai in the last month or so of his mourning period where he has committed to burying thousands of dead soldiers from a great battle and that is a seriously strong opener to grab your attention. Sadly, the plot does meander a bit from there and I think you can tell that this is because Kay is cutting loose in a sense and having a bit of fun. It's obvious that Kay's favorite part of writing this book though was getting to turn his skills to imitating High Tang Chinese poetry to the best of his ability and I think largely succeeding in creating a character based on one of the greatest Chinese poets who ever lived as an excuse to create more and more of this poetry. So with the focus seeming to be a bit more on Kay getting to play in his own sandbox for a bit, you'd think the book might have some serious weaknesses but I think many of the elements here are still quite strong. The plot, despite it's occasional lack of focus, showcases particularly well how Kay manages to take small events and masterfully spin them out into grander struggles when he is writing in that mode. There are some areas where he slips up especially with the plot as it concerns Li-Mei, Tai's sister, who is completely extraneous to the plot but has several POV chapters (well, not even complete chapters really, she mostly only gets short sections of chapters) that are well-written but not terribly interesting since they don't really affect the rest of the novel.

The character of Wei Song is also a little underwritten. For how much prominence she is given in the story, it was surprising that she didn't have better chemistry with Tai nor did she really affect the plot too much. The last flaw is one of inconsistency in the themes of the book. Kay wanted to show how events look at the time versus how the appear to historians and while this is done well (as it should be, this is a trick he has used in other books), this zooming into the minutiae of an even as it unfolded and then back out to provide the historical perspective and consequence of the action does not begin until the last third of the book and it is jarring to go through a sudden stylistic shift so late in a story. Compare this to another book I really enjoy, The Folding Knife by KJ Parker, which uses the same trick but does so from beginning to end, blending historical retrospective with in-the-moment action for a full picture of the life and importance of the main character, and you can see how Kay's use of the technique feels a bit misapplied and rushed by contrast. But I consider these to be mostly minor flaws. To be sure, these flaws matter enough to mark this as not being among Kay's best books but they are not nearly bad enough to reduce this from a great book to a bad book. It is a marvelous read by a great author even if he is not working at the height of his powers.

* **Why is this a top novel?** Stellar prose, great plot, and a great use of Chinese culture to build a unique fantasy work. It's hard to go wrong with GGK.
* **Would you continue on?** Absolutely. I've heard that River of Stars is among Kay's best books so I don't want to miss out on that.

**56. Sabriel by Garth Nix, Book 1 of the Old Kingdom series (40 on the 2019 list)**

&gt;Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, a powerful necromancer who guards the kingdom of Ancelstierre from the raised dead who sometimes cross the border that divides Ancelstierre from the Old Kingdom. When something befalls Abhorsen, Sabriel must take up his charge and find some way to protect her homeland and save her father.

I have a distinct memory of being 8 or 9 and having this book recommended to me by a librarian only to not like it. But hey, I wasn't even double digits then and I'm guessing my taste was pretty arbitrary. How does it stack up now, decades later? The answer is: it's pretty good. I'm not sure it's the end all be all of children's lit that it's sometimes made out to be but I liked it, it was unique even among more adult-aiming fantasy, and it had a good amount of personality. The magic system is a real standout here, focusing on necromancy as a form of protection with the position of Abhorsen serving as something like a warrior monk with a sword in one hand and several mystical bells that are rung to effect different outcomes in dealing with raised dead. The prose is lean and moves along quickly which helps the story feel like it has a lot of momentum even in slower sections. One of the more interesting things about this book is that Ancelstierre is a lot closer to being a modern nation (complete with guns and flight) while the Old Kingdom is a somewhat more traditional medieval world.

One of the standouts of this book is Sabriel herself who already starts off the book as a confident and capable warrior rather than having to grow into that role as so many other protagonists in YA aiming stories often have to do. Rather, Sabriel starts the book already being given the tools to do the job she's known she's been training to do for a lifetime and accepts that this is her role pretty quickly even though she is horrified by the idea that she may lose her father. You may wonder if her accepting her burden so quickly undercuts the potential for internal tension but Sabriel finds other ways to create internal conflict without resorting to the more common approach. Sabriel adores her father and wants to be Abhorsen but she knows those two desires are at loggerheads because there can only be one Abhorsen at any time and the way for the next one to rise is for the former to die. She understandably feels guilt at the prospect that her eventual ascension can only come through the death of the person she cares about most in the world even though she can't help but continue to want it. It's a unique way to deal with this type of story and a subtler approach to a successor relationship than I think I've seen in any other story of this type before.

There are few drawbacks here. I gathered from reading the book that Mogget is supposed to be funny but I never found anything he said particularly amusing. It didn't wind up becoming one of those awful situations where the character winds up annoying you, he more just felt like a flat presence that wasn't contributing much to the story. A slightly bigger drawback is that Sabriel has a pretty compelling internal monologue most of the time but this aspect of the narration often shuts off during fights leading to scenes where the action alone is supposed to carry the writing and, while it isn't bad writing by any stretch of the imagination, I feel like it's a serious missed opportunity not being able to see how Sabriel thinks and plans in a fight. Letting a little more of that personality through would have improved the action from solid to great. The villain is also on the generic side and introduced a little too late into the novel for me to feel that he had much real impact on my reading experience. Had the character been introduced earlier and been lurking in the background the whole time as a menacing presence instead of popping up at the last minute, it would have made for a stronger climax. But, as I'm sure you can tell from my glowing praise, this book was still a good read that I enjoyed immensely. It's quick but thoughtful and well-written.

* **Why is this a top novel?** Unique magic and setting, strong characters, a more original take on the conflict of stepping into your parent's shoes
* **Would you continue on?** Maybe....I mean, I guess if I had to....just kidding, of course it's a yes.

**56. Sufficiently Advanced Magic by Andrew Rowe, Book 1 of the Arcane Ascension (42 on the 2019 list)**

&gt;Corin Cadence undertakes the trial of the goddess in an enormous tower, hoping to gain an attunement that will provide him with power and hopefully someday help him to find his long lost older brother. Unfortunately, he comes out with the Enchanter attunement, an undervalued power that causes his father to practically disown him and to earn him a status as a second class student, frustrating his efforts to advance quickly.

This book has a strong opening with Corin immediately put forth as an underdog who needs to constantly prepare and scheme to succeed, who was passed over and ignored in favor of his older brother who then failed and disappeared unexpectedly and who Corin must now do everything to rescue. As I read through this opening again, I wondered to myself ""wait, I didn't like this book last time. Why didn't I like it? This is an incredible way to begin."" And that's when the book's trademark endlessly detailed explanations and overplanning began. Interminable guessing, second guessing, and triple guessing of every item and situation. Analysis from every angle about every possible conceived notion about what it could mean. I immediately remembered how much of this book was composed of stuff like this and no longer wondered why I hadn't enjoyed this last time.

To be fair, I think this character trait is purposeful and multifaceted in a way most LitRPG books don't manage. Corin's extreme planning is both a strength (given enough time, he can figure anything out and be prepared) and a weakness (he often takes so long to plan rather than act that he can often misses important opportunities due to overthinking) and it's also clearly a flaw based in part on his own neuroses and feelings of inferiority as a disfavored son of an overbearing noble parent. But oh man, do I hate how this trait expresses itself and can't stand reading through the sections where his overthinking kicks in. The problem with well rounded characters is they have to have flaws to be believable and the problem with having flaws is that no matter which flaw you choose to imbue a character with, you will pick something that will be a complete turnoff to someone. Here we've found mine.

I am not really a Lit RPG fan. I get why people like it and how the detailed explanations for everything can make for inventive magic usage that doesn't feel like deus ex machina but the elaborately explained rules can often wear me down and make what should be a story feel more like a user manual. That being said, my own prejudices aside, I believe this is actually a good book — just not a book I enjoy. Much care has been placed in the creation of a hard magic system that is thoroughly explained at every turn (paragraphs upon paragraphs of explanations!) for characters to come up with clever twists that are largely within the realm of possibility given the strict rules of magic that were given in the beginning. This is the joy of these types of books as far as I understand: that they explain the rules so that you will appreciate characters being clever when they figure out how to twist those rules and I can appreciate that many of these are well done. SAM doesn't fall into the typical pitfall of these books of having protagonists who are largely uninteresting or personality free because all of the focus has gone into the magic. Indeed, Corin is a unique character and one of the few notable asexual protagonists I can think of in fantasy literature which is an interesting story element when others begin expressing attraction in him and he doesn't know what to do about any of that. He also builds real relationships with other characters who manage to be distinct and largely enjoyable.

So the question is: what downsides are there? I'm actually hard pressed to find any serious flaws here. When met on its own terms, the book accomplishes everything it sets out to do. So why don't I like it? Is it all just bias against this type of book or is there something truly bad about it turning me off?

In writing critiques there are two things that stump reviewers more than anything else. 1) is how do you say something interesting about a bland novel but 2) which applies here is how do you write about a book that is done well but you still didn't enjoy? You can't just say ""everything was good. I didn't like it"" that'll give anyone who reads your review whiplash. You can try writing at length why you don't like it but if you're already acknowledging that you don't see any real flaws in it, it feels like an exercise in futility to spell out what didn't work for you personally because it will inevitably come down to vague feelings or petty reasons that anyone who likes the book will understandably react to with ""is that really all it took for you to dislike it?"" It inevitably feels navel-gazey and misguided to write something that boils down to ""well, I don't like jazz chords"" when the most likely response to it will be a straightforward ""then why did you listen to a jazz song?"" Put another way, your problems aren't with the book itself but with its genre and there's no good way to separate individual critique from a systemic critique that has honestly been well discussed by many already. Sure you could trim the exposition magic discussions I think that's a part most people enjoy and the book would probably be weaker overall without them.

So what is there to say? I can try to boil it down to ""I don't like LitRPG"" even though SAM clearly avoids the obvious pitfalls of that genre. I can't call it bad on it's own merits despite my dislike. I don't have anything more profound to say than ""I think I get it and I think it's good but it's still not for me."" I guess just try it for yourself and see if it's for you.

* **Why is this a top novel?** Inventive and full of well thought out magic that clever protagonists come up with clever solutions to.
* **Would you continue on?** Probably not, I'm still not a fan of this subgenre as a whole.

353,"Fantasy Author of the Day: Andrew Marc RoweHey folks,

I am Andrew Marc Rowe and I am your Fantasy Author of the Day! Today coincides with the launch of my second novel, The Yoga of Pain, Book Two of The Yoga Trilogy. It is a little bit difficult to describe my writing, except as an intersection of fantasy, spirituality, mythology, and a little dark humour. Think Game of Thrones meets The Alchemist meets Trainspotting.

That said, the first book in the series, called The Yoga of Strength, was more deeply about the masculine Hero’s Journey, about moksha / liberation from suffering from the male perspective. This one, The Yoga of Pain, is a story told from the feminine perspective. It features the Mage Kathryn, introduced in the first story, as the main focus. The tale is about the purpose of pain, the virtue of forgiveness, and dimensions of redemption and resurrection. It is rife with elements of Hindu, Celtic, Greek, and Christian mythologies and symbolism and metaphor take center stage.

There’s also Knights, magic, political intrigue, Demons, grand battles, cloak and dagger plots, and plenty of action.

Full disclosure: this story deals with the fallout and processing of sexual assault as a major plot point. Although I think it is handled appropriately, and my early (female) reviewers / editors seem to think that is the case, some of it might be difficult to read.

Here is a review from Bobby Bessey (a woman), founder of Shakti Yoga:

""Andrew Mark Rowe’s newest installment of his yoga trilogy, The Yoga of Pain, does not disappoint. The original soul journey of the first book flows seamlessly into a celebration of the divine feminine as we follow the powerful heroine Kathryn on her own voyage of self-inquiry. As in the previous book, the yoga reference in the title refers to yoga’s mystical and philosophical roots. Introduced to both the ferocious and loving embodiments of the goddess Kali in her early childhood Kathryn begins a soul expedition into the transformative and multifaceted role of the energy of the goddess. Kathryn’s painful past of violence and abandonment become the springboard for a triumphant victory against self-hatred, and a passage into the voice of intuition. This deeper subtext is immersed in a gritty narrative that takes place in a medieval time, complete with magic, fantastical creatures, and warring knights. The Yoga of Pain is also a love story, flowing from a unified thread of insight that fuses the world’s spiritual traditions. The wisdom of countless poets and gurus swirl as a whirling dervish into a tapestry symbols and mysticism that crosses all borders. The ending culminates in a satisifying victory of unity over separation, while simultaneously setting up the reader to eagerly anticipate the final segment of this entertaining and inspirational saga.""

Here is a review from advance reader Peter Shea:

""Chaos is spreading throughout the Kingdom of Thrairn. The rift in Old Valtha has opened, and deadly enemies approach from without and within. King Janus has retreated into his castle in Isha, and our trinity of heroes, Andrew, Kathryn and Simon, must find themselves amidst the wreckage...

In Book 2 of The Yoga Trilogy, Andrew Marc Rowe spins an excellently structured and terrifically paced tale, weaving his tremendous knowledge of spirituality and mythology into a harmonious journey of acceptance, forgiveness and resurrection.

I can't wait for Book 3!""

I've watched up through episode 6 and find the story confusing and convoluted. There are strange time jumps that are hard to recognize in the moment, and new characters are consistently introduced who dip in and out of the story throughout the season.

Henry Cavill is great as Geralt, and I enjoy his banter with Jaskier, but all of the other characters are pretty forgettable to me.

I'm contemplating whether I want to keep going at this point. I'm not sharing this post to tear down the show -- I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts on the first season (in particular, perspectives that are different from my own).

He meets a storyteller, gets a sword, steals a different book, has his book stolen by the storyteller, finds the magical world, rolls 6 dice and sculls a drink to gain access to the library,  then doesn't read any of the books (this I find odd. Also the dice rolling is never really explained. Or the drink now I come to think of it). 


Symbolism of bees, swords, hearts, crowns, feathers, keys, cats, moons, books and more pops up all over the place rather bewilderingly. 


He rescues his book stealing storytelling stalker from a mysterious and violent lady who breaks doors and collects door knobs, is given a mission to find a man lost in time from a magical book in a crypt inside a statue, and starts reading another book.  


Are you confused? Because I sure am and I've read this. 


Another book is introduced, human hearts get hidden, found and transplanted, someone is a bunny or used to be a bunny (I'm not clear on that, but then I'm not clear on anything anymore), owls are everywhere and might be dangerous, bees are making all the food, paintings telling the future show up, a bunch of possibly unnecessary time travelling happens, and then **everything gets drowned in honey.**


I'm not making this up. 


I honestly cannot recommend this book, but it does have many very good reviews and obviously a lot of people enjoy it. The prose is fantastic and there are extremely...novel ideas in it. For a while there I really loved it, but now? Now I'm confused and slightly disgruntled because nothing makes sense, nothing is explained, and I don't follow the logic because it seems to follow the theory that whatever the author wrote must make sense because it was written by the author.

363,"Rec: Fantasy books with a 'gimmick'Hey all

Looking for some recommendations for what to read next! I just finished Orconomics and it's sequel and took and unexpected liking to it!

I think the main reason for this was it's use of economics and financial crisis in a fantasy setting. It felt very fresh! I'm therefore interested in reading books in a similar vein, books that somehow take an alternative approach to fantasy, utilizing some unique element somehow, obviously while still being engaging and well-written!

Cheers everyone!",1

&gt;Widowed  by a violent conquest, imprisoned as a spoil of war, spirited Lady  Elienne encounters a formidable visitation inside her locked cell. A  powerful, unknown sorcerer promises her a reprieve in trade for a  precarious fate: safe transfer from her ruined duchy to another world,  there to become chosen bride for the Prince of Pendaire. But the  perilous bargain depends on her late husband’s unborn child, with the  defenseless infant birthed as threatened centerpiece in a deadly  struggle to upset the succession.  
Alone  with bare wits, Elienne faces entanglement in vicious intrigue, herself  the target for ambitious usurpers already plotting Prince Darion’s  downfall through dark magic.

365,"Spooky Child as Viewpoint CharacterSpooky, uncanny children are a common trope of horror, Anime and occasionally Fantasy.

Most protagonists of YA Fantasy are implausibly competent, and often have magic powers.  It has struck me they would come off as very weird to adult characters.

Lots of Isekai has an adult from our world get reincarnated in a Fantasy world, sometimes in the body of a child.

What authors have combined these?  Have you ever read a book where the main viewpoint character saw themselves as a normal person just getting by, but we have other scenes from the point of view of other characters who saw them as uncanny or spooky?

I've only seen this done in passing, but I rather liked it then.",1

What do you thing? Should I keep going, or just finish it and read something else? Since it's a ten books series, I don't want to make it to book three - four just to finally abandon it then and loose time that can be used reading anything else.

One thing that turns me off from a lot of fantasy novels is overpowered magic. I'm fine with magic, but I don't like the kind where wizards can straight up kill entire armies. Maybe ones where it makes them powerful, but they are by no means invincible and can be killed by anybody realistically. I guess like Gandalf in LOTR is a good example of what I like magic wise, or Game of Thrones.

My first warning bell came when reading the overview and seeing it was about the well worn trope of the old greats getting back together one last time, I proceeded warily from then on.

Less is more in my opinion and this book has crammed just about every monster inside this world and I kept rolling my eyes as more and more were introduced. This goes along with a magic system that seems very powerful, not fleshed out and could of solved the characters problem very easily in my opinion.

I just can’t shake that this book reads like a movie script, just enough detail given about environments to get by and very cardboard characters that you’ve seen a million times. Aside from witty quips it doesn’t seem like I’ll be getting much in character development.

Finally it doesn’t help that I’ve seen the title of the second book and now have a pretty good idea about the fate of a character who is central to the plot. 

So should I give up on this? Is it more of the same in the second half or will things really pick up?",1
378,"SPFBO 5 Finalist Review: A Tale of Stars and Shadows by Lisa CassidyI've posted another finalist review last week and I wanted to post another of my favorites from the competition. For those of you who are unfamiliar, SPFBO is a competition held by Mark Lawrence that highlights self-published fantasy. 10 blogs choose 10 finalists among 300 initial entries. From there, the finalists battle it out for the number one spot. 

For me, personally, there have been a handful of standouts and I'll post a couple more reviews of my favorite entries from this year. 

**The Review:** 

Talyn was once a part of the elite fighting force known as the Callanan until she was brought to her knees by the death of her partner, Sari. She dropped out of the Callanan and became a Kingsheild guard instead, but she was hiding a secret … she didn’t want to be a warrior anymore. If that secret got out it could be the end of her. The leader of the Kingsheild figured this out and blackmailed her into taking an assignment in a foreign land. A land where slavery is still practiced, humans are considered second class citizens, and the ‘winged folk’ are basically the rulers of the nation. It’s a bizarre assignment because she’s been tasked with organizing and training a group of soldiers that are to be used as a personal guard for the prince. The prince of the winged folk… the same winged folk who don’t respect humans, or outsiders, or women. To make matters even more strange, they don’t want her trainees to be from their own kind. They want her to pick her trainees from a batch of criminals sitting in prison. Why she was chosen for this position and why they want her to train a guard made of human criminals is left to be discovered later.

This book has extremely ‘readable’ prose, it’s light while also being descriptive enough to create an immersive experience. The scene where she makes it to Dock City had beautiful imagery that sucked me into the moment and I shared a moment of awe with the character. The writing was clean with very few errors – the ones I caught were things that wouldn’t be picked up by spell check because they were real words that were misused e.g. ‘bought’ instead of ‘brought’. However, there weren’t many and it didn’t detract from my enjoyment at all. I felt like the pacing was nice and even, there wasn’t a point where I felt things were rushed or dragging and I particularly liked the ending.

I enjoyed the world-building quite a bit, it’s been a long while since I’ve read about a race that has wings/flies that isn’t a dragon based race. The city felt absolutely real and thought out, all the way down to how the wingless young of the winged folk would get around their city. The writing was extremely atmospheric, so this hot, humid, sea-side city came to life for me. I knew how it smelled, I knew what the people looked like, I knew how the architecture looked like and its functionality (lots of ropes and ladders on the winged folk side).

Although there were two POV’s, Shadowhawk and Talyn, I definitely feel like Tal was our main character, she got significantly more page time and we got to know her much better earlier on. Shadowhawk remained a mysterious character for most of the book. Talyn was a great character and I loved her approach to leadership. Taking control of a group of criminals and attempting to turn them into soldiers is a big ask, and it felt natural the way she took command rather than forced to make the story work. She’s smart, disciplined, and can read others well. She knows when to push and when to hold back, and how to show respect and also demand it in return without resorting to fear tactics to maintain obedience. I also found the relationship she had with her partner to be a much-needed answer to the vacuum of female-female friendships in many of my reads over the past year. The bond they had was basically equal to a spousal level of love, trust, and intimacy except it wasn’t romantic or sexual – just a very deep bond that went past friendship. We get to know her friend, Sari, through her lingering presence in Talyn’s mind. Often times Talyn has a voice in the back of her head telling her this and that, getting into arguments, egging her on etc, and it’s always Sari. This year the finalists have been full of memorable characters and I’ve enjoyed myself so much.

As a closing note for my second round of being a SPFBO judge I have to say this was a spectacular year. Last year my highest score given out was an 8.6, this year I had three books hit that score or higher – those books being Sword of Kaigen, Fortune’s Fool and this one!

379,"Recommendations please and thank you.Good day fantasy fans!

I'm about 9 hours out from finishing Oathbringer, and whilst I blasted through the first book I'm finding it difficult to stay interested in this one. There are some good moments,but it just keeps going on and on...
I have saved up some audible credits, and I like owning and reading physical books as well.
I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and own several of the ref books (cross sections and visual guides) because I love a developed lore and seeing cool little details. I also own the World of Ice and Fire ref book and enjoyed the series (book and TV) although the books had some real dud chapters and the TV show... I love the LotR films but find it hard to finish the first book. When I was younger the Darren Shan books (Saga and Demonata) were my favourites because vampires and monsters are awesome. I really like the character Drizzt and enjoyed reading the books to watch him struggle through challenges and constantly try to better himself, although the Forgotten Realms setting is a bit too mad cap to invest in for me. I've read Harry Potter about 12 times (and Barry Trotter about 3) and my favourite book of the series is HBP - &gt;!Harry cutting up Malfoy!&lt; is an unforgettable scene for me. Love the Death books by Pratchett because the Deaths character is awesome,as is Pratchett's style.
I disliked the Assassins Apprentice. I'm actually still surprised I finished it. I found the MC boring and I didn't really get the ending because I had lost interest by the time I got there. I read the whole Twilight series even though it was boring because it was trashy and easy to get through (at the time it helped with talking to girls as well =] ). Belgarath the Sorcerer started well, but again I got bored by the end and probably won't read the rest of the series. I thought Magician was cool but felt like it didn't really go anywhere...

So I think I'm looking for stories with fewer MCs, focus on self-improvement and determination, a world with cool details, and maybe shorter single books or easier to read series - whilst trying to avoid too much MC whining, boring scenes and dragged out page counts, and over the top magic systems.

Also, bonus points for the following; swords, knives, animals, shadow beings, interesting architecture, 'out-there' writing style (Pratchett, Snicket), people wearing the colour black, and a feeling of community.",1
380,"Possible tip for ""getting"" the Witcher S1 timeline shenanigansJust a little connection I made, which may help others struggling with making sense of how The Witcher jumps between timelines - there's a similar, scaled down approach in the recent movie Dunkirk. For those who saw it, anyway.

In Dunkirk, three stories were woven together. There was a tale of frontline soldiers that took place over the course of a week, a civilian boatman whose story encompassed one day, and a high intensity airforce arc with 1 hour on the clock. The clincher is...they all ""ended"" at the same point in time.

So, to dumb it right down, if the climax happens at midnight on Sunday, then we've got a story covering Mon-Sun, a story covering all of Sunday, and a story covering 11pm onwards on Sunday. But the POV bounces between them.

Dunkirk is easier to follow, due to the lack of crossover with characters between arcs, but making the link in my own mind certainly helped me wrap my head around what The Witcher was doing. An arc spread over hundreds of years (Yen), an arc spread over a few decades (Geralt), and an arc covering a matter of days/weeks (Ciri). But all converging in the final episode.",1
381,"My most anticipated 2020 releases in SFF - A (Probably) Non-Exhaustive ListFollowing in the leafy footsteps of my coblogger in [making longass lists about squee-worthy stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/cuydtk/a_huge_and_completely_arbitrary_list_of_great/), here’s a random list of books releasing in 2020 that I’m excited about. I thought about making it in chronological order of release but then I remembered that I am lazy. Here goes:

[The Empire of Gold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46033842-the-empire-of-gold) by S.A Chakraborty: the final book of the Daevabad trilogy will be released next summer, and I’m terrified. The Kingdom of Copper was a crazy ride, and I have a feeling book 3 is going to destroy me. Destroy. If you haven't read the Daevabad Trilogy yet, pick up The City of Brass for a unique, engrossing epic fantasy in a realm of complex politics and belligerent djinns.

[Hollow Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41555965-hollow-empire) by Sam Hawke: the highly-anticipated sequel to City of Lies. City worked well as a standalone but it's impossible not to want more from those sweet characters and this amazing world. And also, yay more poison!

[The Wolf of Oren-yaro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46207682-the-wolf-of-oren-yaro) by K.S. Villoso: I've already read the self-pubbed version of The Wolf of Oren-yaro and loved how intimate this epic fantasy tale felt, but I'm looking forward to the Orbit cut. I'm hoping the new version features a certain husband meeting his unfortunate end very early in the book. I'm also ridiculously excited about DAT COVER.

[The Nobleman’s Guide to Scandal and Shipwrecks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48473560-the-nobleman-s-guide-to-scandal-and-shipwrecks) by Mackenzi Lee: the third book of the Montague Siblings series. The day it was announced...oh man. I made all kinds of weird noises. The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue and The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy are among my favourite novels ever. Funny and profound and fun and queer as hell.  I can't wait to see what kind of adventure the third Montague sibling will embark on.

[Stormsong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41473380-stormsong) by CL Polk: Another sequel! Stormsong is the follow-up novel to Witchmark, Polk's darkly romantic faux-edwardian magic &amp; murder mystery debut. I loved Witchmark,and Stormsong is going to follow a new set of characters, one of whom was pretty unlikeable in Book 1, so I'm warily excited about it. And triple cheer for more f/f romance fantasy!

[Drowned Country](https://www.tor.com/2020/01/07/cover-reveals-drowned-country-by-emily-tesh/) by Emily Tesh: The sequel to Silver in the Wood, which is the cutest, most ""huh didn't think it was going there"" retelling of the Green Man's myth.

[We Ride the Storm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39781307-we-ride-the-storm?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=NQI5DVBubg&amp;rank=1) by Devin Madson: another self-to-trad pub book! I haven't read the self-pubbed version yet (shame...shaaame), but I figured I'll wait for the new one. Literally everyone I know who's read We Ride the Storm has fallen in love with it, the characters, the writing, the decapitations. Gimme.

[Mexican Gothic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48366686-mexican-gothic?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=LipNZB73Cv&amp;rank=1) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia: horror, but horror is specfic so we won't squabble. I don't know much about Mexican Gothic except that it's by Silvia Moreno-Garcia and I'll read everything by her from now til the end of times. Plus it sounds deliciously atmospheric.

[The Obsidian Tower](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47509773-the-obsidian-tower) by Melissa Caruso: the start of a new series by Melissa Caruso! I love her take on magic and I'm so excited about these new books.

[The Extraordinaries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47902697-the-extraordinaries) by T.J. Klune: the cute queer superheroes YA we need and deserve. The blurb reminds me of The Infinite Noise by Lauren Shippen. And I say that in a loving way, I'm excited to see what TJ Klune can do with another editor, because his Lightning Struck Heart was loads of fun but needed some serious machete-editing IMO.

[A Neon Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247308-a-neon-darkness) by Lauren Shippen: speaking of Lauren Shippen! Another story in the world of the Bright Sessions audiodrama (superheroes going to therapy is the official pitch. Listen to it, you won't regret it), after The Infinite Noise. Book 2 is going to focus on a major antagonist of the story, and I have no doubt it's going to be amazing. **Edit**: and how very dare I forget, there's also a [new audioseries](https://twitter.com/thecollegetapes/status/1190397482221502464?s=20) about Adam and Caleb, the protagonists of The Infinite Noise, that's going to start in 2020. Lauren is crazy-busy.

[Moontangled](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48411939-moontangled?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=aLtCnqASEH&amp;rank=1) by Stephanie Burgis: Patent cheating because I've actually already read a review copy of it, and it's charming! A new instalment in the Harwood Spellbook series, with, as usual, magic and love and self-sacrifice and fae shenanigans.

[A Dance with Fate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36253130-a-dance-with-fate?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=z8vOdy52CI&amp;rank=1) by Juliet Marillier: the sequel to Harp of Kings, which is Marillier's new series featuring bards who are also spies and warriors in medieval Ireland (for fuck sake, the moment I wrote ""bard"" I had ""Toss a Coin to your Witcher"" in my head. Why, Netflix? Why?). Book 1 was as fun as it sounds, but left a lot of doors ajar so a sequel is more than welcome.

[Girl, Serpent, Thorn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47590411-girl-serpent-thorn) by Melissa Bashardoust: I know that it's a queer Persian myth retelling, and that the smug people who got to read it already literally screamed that I should read it asap. Yesyes please.

[Untitled Nikolai Duology Book 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36307674-untitled) by Leigh Bardugo: Ehhh that's a tricky one for me, because King of Scars (book 1) was aggressively okay-ish IMO. But as a Six of Crows ~~obsessive~~ casual, chill fan, a new book in the Grishaverse is cause for celebration and anticipation. And Nikolai is an incredibly compelling character (compelling enough to make me finish the snoozefest that was King of Scars).

[Unconquerable Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36205188-unconquerable-sun?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Q3Chxnsv8g&amp;rank=1) by Kate Elliott: THIS BOOK. THIS FUCKING BOOK. I've been hearing about it for ages. Ages. Ok, what seems like ages. Kate Elliott is a master tease, and my reader's heart belonged to her the moment the words ""gender-bent Alexander the Great in space"" were first tweeted. I can't believe it's finally real, and that I'll get to read it soon-ish.

[A Conjuring of Assassins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44017768-a-conjuring-of-assassins) by Cate Glass: the sequel to An Illusion of Thieves, Cate Glass' debut about a magical heist  in an Italian-like setting. Yes, another faux-Italy heist story, but another *good* one. It has a pretty fun approach to magic and it combines deep character work and exciting heist-y action.

[The Unspoken Name](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45046552-the-unspoken-name?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=3cdnXXfOzo&amp;rank=1) by A.K. Larkwood: I'll be real here. I am just dutifully following the hype train that's extremely loud and extremely enthusiastic.

[Empire of the Vampire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43728380-empire-of-the-vampire) by Jay Kristoff: Vampires shouldn't be my thing but Kristoff has a knack for making me like things I don't usually like. I'm interested to see his (s)take on vampires (please don't judge me, it's almost midnight here, I'm tired).

[Shorefall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42393392-shorefall) by Robert Jackson Bennett: did someone say faux-italian setting heist? Shorefall is the sequel to Foundryside, which was a fantastic read with a unique take on hard magic. Let's see where the series is going.

[The City we Became](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42074525-the-city-we-became) by NK Jemisin: NK Jemisin, need I say more?

[Dark Rise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49348938-dark-rise) by C.S. Pacat: I legit worship Pacat. Prince's Gambit is probably imprinted into my eyeballs at this point, and I've devoured the Fence graphic novels at a greedy speed. So you're telling me we'll get a YA series from her and it's in an alt-London and it's so very gay? I'm a happy happy fangirl. **Edit**: aaand it's a 2021 release. I got carried away by the excite.

[Cemetary Boys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46676540-cemetery-boys?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=hzpYATRnKz&amp;rank=1) by Aiden Thomas: it just sounds too adorable. A YA/fantasy romance with ghosts and magic and a celebration of queerness. And my spidey senses pick up a hint of snarky/sunshine pairing which is Very Much My Thing, Thank You.

[The Rook and Rose](https://www.orbitbooks.net/2019/10/03/acquisition-announcement-the-rook-and-rose-series-by-marie-brennan-and-alyc-helms/) by M. A. Carrick (Marie Brennan and Alyc Helms): political intrigues and nobility squabbles. My own personal catnip.

[The Angel of the Crows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47902910-the-angel-of-the-crows) by Katherine Addison: I literally learned that Katherine Addison had a new release planned for 2020 *today*. It sounds crazy and over-the-top and oh I do love historical urban fantasy, and I do love alternate-history-London. I do not love vampires, again, but hey, maybe 2020 is the year they are back into fashion.

[Architects of Memory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44438351-architects-of-memory) by Karen Osborne: GAY SPACE OPERA YAY.

[The Protectorate Book 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49088636-new-megan-e-o-keefe-novel-2) by Megan O'Keefe: the sequel to the SUPER CLIFF-HANGER-Y Velocity Weapon THANK YOU FOR THAT MEGAN. More seriously, the most fun I've ever had reading a space opera, and I can't wait for more.

**Tarot Sequence book 3** by K.D Edwards: unsure if the sequel to The Last Sun (2018) and The Hanged Man (2019) is going to be released in 2020, but chances are, it will. I am obsessed over this urban fantasy series with hilarious banter and crazy worldbuilding.

[P. Djèlí Clark's debut novel](https://www.tor.com/2019/07/08/announcing-p-djeli-clark-debut-novel-and-two-new-novellas/): I love Clark's novellas. His worldbuilding skills are unparalleled and his vision of steampunk is unique. I begged a higher power for a full novel from him, and lo and behold, Tor answered my prayers. It will be set in the same universe as A Dead Djinn in Cairo, and we actually do not have a release date, so 2020 is just my shiny optimistic estimate.

**Untitled Tasha Suri book**: I’m pretty sure she’s working on something, I don’t know what or whether we’ll have it in 2020, but I want it. **Edit**: AHAAA!! Tasha Suri's The Jasmine Throne has been announced for a 2021 release date:  https://twitter.com/tashadrinkstea/status/1218196054279147526?s=20  

**Untitled Alix E. Harrow book**: ditto, pretty much (she is working on a ""suffragettes but witches"" project and also a series of novellas which are multiverse fairy tales and I don't know, I must have been very very good in a previous life to deserve this). 

Annnd I probably forgot a few. I might edit later. What are *your* most anticipated releases of the year?",1

Happy reading! (And I did ask the mods for permission to post this)",1
383,"Do you think I might like The Long Price Quartet?I'm mainly interested in the series because I've heard a ton of praise for it, it is complete, and it supposedly takes place over a span of 60 years (long time spans are something missing from epic fantasy series imo... I'm tired of entire stories taking place over only a few months or years). Also I see it has an Asian setting, which I'm always down for. This series has an air of mystery to me because I looked up information about the series, but reviewers are hesitant to talk much about what the series is actually like because of spoilers. So, I have little idea if this series is for me or not. Based on my preferences below, can you tell me if I will likely enjoy this Quartet?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Most of all, I like long journeys where two or more characters must hike or ride across the wilderness together for a long time to reach a destination. A road trip with plenty of sights and stops. Like Sam and Frodo's adventure. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm also open to court intrigue where the character hangs out at a palace the whole book, but only if there are conspiracies or assassinations in the palace! Or if the palace is under siege, that is good too. I love hopeless sieges.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A satisfying, ""earned"" ending would be nice, though not necessarily happy. My favorite endings tend to be bittersweet. Like, the dark lord is stopped but the hero's friends died kinda thing.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like beautiful prose, especially descriptions of nature.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I like 3-dimensional characters who develop, grow, change sides. I prefer knights, thieves, assassins, monks, barbarians, priests and footsoldier characters. I like wizards, kings, queens, and nobles when they lack plot armor. I'd prefer it if at least one protagonist is kind and sympathetic (I'm burnt out on Jorg Ancrath types). I like how GRRM isn't afraid to kill his characters off, but I think he killed too many important characters off by the end of \*A Storm of Swords\*... so a little plot armor is nice, but not too much. Memorable side characters are also appreciated. Books that make me cry are the ones that stick with me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Strong, wise themes. I want the characters to learn positive life lessons. The more wisdom, the better.

&amp;#x200B;

\-World-building wise, it doesn't have to be Tolkien, Erikson or Jordan if the characters and plot are strong enough to compensate for it. In fact I'd prefer if the author didn't get too carried away with descriptions. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Pacing-wise, I like slow burns and fast paced novels, but I don't like novels where nothing happens or where too much happens (think Rise of Skywalker, where an overwhelming amount of plot is thrown at you too quickly). A good slow burn is \*The Curse of Chalion\*, a good fast-paced ride would be the majority of \*Riyria Revelations\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Magic system-wise, the more rules there are to the magic system, the more I'll expect magic usage to make logical sense at all times. When magic has few or no rules (LotR, Conan, First Law), I don't expect much logic when it is used. When the rules get D&amp;Dish or Pokemon-esque in depth, the more I am irked whenever those rules are fudged. So basically, complicated magic systems are fine as long as they remain consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

\-And a special preference: at least one good duel!

&amp;#x200B;

387,"Looking for the stories of my childhoodHello! This is my first Reddit post and I'm afraid I'll make plenty of descriptive mistakes. However, I'm here with a purpose. I'm looking for a book (series) that I read once as a younger-than-I-am-now human.

Here's what the mists of time are giving me. First, I remember a distinctly D&amp;D vibe, the characters went on an adventure in a party and, from what I know now, fulfilled seemingly common D&amp;D party roles. An elfish nerd/magic one, a human protagonist/fighter, and a wise old cleric woman. Secondly, two characters stand out to me - unfortunately not their names. The first character was a wise, old lady who helped the ""party"" out with some herbalistic-based healing (had an arcane element as well). She lived in a cave-like structure I believe? The second character was an elf (I think), a big-ass nerd, and read lots of books ""on-screen"" (the entire reason she stood out to me as a quiet, nervous child). Additionally, I know this was in the ""juvenile fiction"" section of my library - so likely a moderately ""kid-friendly"" series. I remember dragons (of course, so helpful) and a distinctly dragon-themed cover and title which carried throughout the series. ALSO ALSO I think there was a long-ish plot point that involved the protagonist having to farm/ranch and tame a horse? or maybe it was horse-racing? who knows? (someone other than me hopefully)

I'm sorry that this is a way less descriptive account than would be helpful, but maybe there's a super fan out there who can tell me what I lost to the sands of time.",1

***A Curse So Dark and Lonely:***

&gt;**Fall in love, break the curse.**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year, Prince Rhen, the heir of Emberfall, thought he could be saved easily if a girl fell for him. But that was before he turned into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. Before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, Harper learned to be tough enough to survive. When she tries to save a stranger on the streets of Washington, DC, she's pulled into a magical world.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Break the curse, save the kingdom.**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Harper doesn't know where she is or what to believe. A prince? A curse? A monster? As she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what's at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.

***A Heart So Fierce and Broken***

&gt;***Find the heir, win the crown.***  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The curse is finally broken, but Prince Rhen of Emberfall faces darker troubles still. Rumors circulate that he is not the true heir and that forbidden magic has been unleashed in Emberfall. Although Rhen has Harper by his side, his guardsman Grey is missing, leaving more questions than answers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;***Win the crown, save the kingdom.***  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Rumored to be the heir, Grey has been on the run since he destroyed Lilith. He has no desire to challenge Rhen--until Karis Luran once again threatens to take Emberfall by force. Her own daughter Lia Mara sees the flaws in her mother’s violent plan, but can she convince Grey to stand against Rhen, even for the good of Emberfall?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The heart-pounding, compulsively readable saga continues as loyalties are tested and new love blooms in a kingdom on the brink of war.

394,"A Bunch of Small Reviews of Some Books Featuring VampiresWell, I binge read a lot over December so I thought I'd do some mini-reviews.

## [Cat’s Paws and Curses by Nancy Warren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49109960-cat-s-paws-and-curses)

&gt;*Knitting  an ugly Christmas jumper at Cardinal Woolsey’s knitting shop in Oxford,  is supposed to be relaxing. Until a knitter keels over. it’s soon clear  to amateur sleuth Lucy that murder’s in the air and the culprit is one  of the knitters.This is a fun take on a classic closed room mystery. Of course, no  room is every closed when vampires live downstairs. But are the undead  knitters to blame? Or is there more to this Oxford knitting circle than  lumpy Santas and light-up reindeer?This is a shorter holiday whodunnit. It was previously published in the collection: Six Merry Little Murders.More fun than an ugly Christmas jumper, this story is part of the  Vampire Knitting Club series, though it can be read on its own. It’s  full of good clean fun, mysterious goings-on and holiday cheer.*

This novella is book ten of the *Vampire Knitting Club*–I  can’t believe it’s been ten books already! I thought this one was a fun  little mystery. I’ve always enjoyed a locked door mystery and thought  this was a pretty good example of one, if solved a little easily. Lucy  seemed to figure this mystery out early on just based on a few simple  things so there wasn’t a long drawn out investigation with a lot of red  herrings as there normally are in these types of stories. Of course it  helped that she was there when things went down. I do feel bad that so  many people keep ending up dead in her knitting shop though! I also  enjoyed that Christmas was in full swing with the ugly jumpers and the  knitting circle working on gifts for others (well, most of the knitting  circle anyway). This was short and sweet and easily solved–on to the  next! Hopefully her next murder case will be a bit more involved. **4/5 stars.**

## [Fevre Dream by George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream)

&gt;*When  struggling riverboat captain Abner Marsh receives an offer of  partnership from a wealthy aristocrat, he suspects something’s amiss.  But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is  certain. For York doesn’t care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out  all but one of Marsh’s dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he  won’t earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for  wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none  of Marsh’s concern—no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his  actions may prove.Marsh meant to turn down York’s  offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise  of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his  resolve—coupled with the terrible force of York’s mesmerizing gaze. Not  until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh  realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more  noble, than his most fantastic nightmare…and mankind’s most impossible  dream.Here is the spellbinding tale of a  vampire’s quest to unite his race with humanity, of a garrulous  riverman’s dream of immortality, and of the undying legends of the  steamboat era and a majestic, ancient river.*

Oh gosh, what can I say about this one?  Hmmmmmm. Well, it certainly has a sort of ‘classic’ feel to it with the  way the story is told. I really liked the structure of the story itself  and in some ways put me in mind of Interview with the Vampire, with the  vampire telling a human their story for part of the book. Of course the  vampires in this one are a lot more unique! They’re not vampires as we  think of them but really their own species–people can’t just become  vampires–vampires were never human to begin with. And they don’t really  call themselves vampires either. I also like that the hero of this book,  Abner Marsh, is really not the first person you’d think of when you  think ‘hero’. He’s a rough kind of guy, described as ugly, and doesn’t  necessarily have the personality for it. I haven’t read anything of  Martin’s before but I somehow think this is a trademark for him.

Now, as far as enjoyment, this was a  tough one at times. There is a large part of the book where there’s not  much plot–everything kicks in later. There also is a lot of n-word being  thrown around by the ‘bad guys’ which okay yeah the time period, but  also I feel like this is the type of thing thrown around a lot by creators of a certain age in their works because they like to be ‘edgy’ and while I don’t think that’s the case with Martin it certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. My other criticism is that there  was a very obvious solution to the major problem in the book and I  don’t know why they didn’t just use the obvious advantage (daylight)  more often. Like, why wait until almost night to attack? WHY? **3/5 stars.**

## [Crimson Nightmare by Zoey Rivera](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30975925-crimson-nightmare)

&gt;*Trust kills as swift as any dagger. Tragedy follows any path you take. Shy only hopes it doesn’t catch up.Eden was built as the perfect fantasy  reality. Instead of being a means of entertainment for its players, it  became a world where the rich extort the poor to fight and die for their  own amusement.As a pawn, your life is your own. But death in the game doesn’t mean  you reload and start over. When you die in Eden, you die in the real  world. Sometimes survival comes at the cost of another’s life.What will you leave behind when the only certainty in life is your death?This is a novella-sized standalone episode in The Permadeath Legacy Series.*

This was a novella I read strictly for  r/fantasy bingo, I probably wouldn’t have picked it up otherwise. I  haven’t read any of the other books in the series. I read this for the  LitRPG square but while it’s game fiction for sure (the characters live  in a virtual game world) it’s not exactly LitRPG? There are very little  stats given and no leveling up that I could see, it’s almost more akin  to Second Life than an actual game. I think the concept was good but I  felt absolutely no connection to the characters so I can’t really say  that I cared what happened to them–the entire thing fell flat for me. I  think it could have been more clear what the in game world was like, why  people are going into it when the consequences are so high, etc. There  is probably more info in other books but I doubt I’ll read them. **2/5 stars.**

## [Blood Price and Blood Trail by Tanya Huff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317121.Blood_Price)

&gt;*Vicki  Nelson, formerly of Toronto’s homicide unit and now a private  detective, witnesses the first of many vicious attacks that are now  plaguing the city of Toronto. As death follows unspeakable death, Vicki  is forced to renew her tempestuous relationship with her former partner,  Mike Celluci, to stop these forces of dark magic—along with another,  unexpected ally…Henry Fitzroy, the illegitimate son  of King Henry VIII, has learned over the course of his long life how to  blend with humans, how to deny the call for blood in his veins. Without  him, Vicki and Mike would not survive the ancient force of chaos that  has been unleashed upon the world—but in doing so, his identity may be  exposed, and his life forfeit.*

Oh, I absolutely loved these books and I  can’t wait to read the rest of the series. This is some great early  urban fantasy. You have the usual set up (for what we expect now, at the  time this was probably relatively new) of an investigator with a  vampire partner. I love Vicki’s character. She’s so stubborn, but she’s  also a damn good investigator. I like that she knows who she is and what  she wants. Her biggest flaw is her confidence when it comes to her  disability, her failing eyesight, and what she can continue to do with  it regarding her work. She’s working on building that confidence back  up. I also really love Henry! I mean, of course, he’s a vampire so  that’s already a mark in his favor, but he’s also just inherently  likable. He writes romance novels for crying out loud! If he weren’t a  fictional character he might be my ideal man. Anywho. These books were a  lot of fun. The first one involves Vicki and Henry meeting and Vicki  coming to terms (pretty quickly) with the fact that vampires exist, all  while solving a series of murders. The second book continues to  introduce us to the greater paranormal community as Vicki and Henry go  out of town to help some werewolves. Nice. **5/5 stars.**

## [Bloodlust and Bonnets by Emily McGovern](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40680980-bloodlust-bonnets)

&gt;*Set  in early nineteenth-century Britain, Bloodlust &amp; Bonnets follows  Lucy, an unworldly debutante who desires a life of passion and  intrigue—qualities which earn her the attention of Lady Violet Travesty,  the leader of a local vampire cult.But before Lucy can embark on her new life of vampiric  debauchery, she finds herself unexpectedly thrown together with the  flamboyant poet Lord Byron (“from books!”) and a mysterious  bounty-hunter named Sham. The unlikely trio lie, flirt, fight, and  manipulate each other as they make their way across Britain, disrupting  society balls, slaying vampires, and making every effort not to betray  their feelings to each other as their personal and romantic lives become  increasingly entangled.Both witty and slapstick, elegant and gory, Emily McGovern’s  debut graphic novel pays tribute to and pokes fun at beloved romance  tropes, delivering a joyous, action-packed world of friendship and  adventure.*

This book was a fucking delight. The  artwork is simple but cute, even when people are getting decapitated it  looks kind of adorable. I love that Lord Byron was a character in this  because he is utterly ridiculous and provided a lot of laughs. This is  funny, no doubt, but it also has a lot of heart. It’s about Lucy and her  relationships both with Byron and with Sham. I also love how  effortlessly diverse this book is–it just is what it is and nothing’s a  big deal. Lucy is quite funny, she doesn’t really know what she wants  and it takes her pretty much the entire book to figure that out. I like  that it’s a book of self-discovery because those are my favorite kind of stories. Honestly, this was just a lot of fun. It did take me a  little bit to get into because there’s not much of a plot at the  beginning but once I was into it, I was quite happy to just go along  with the crazy ride. **4.5/5 stars.** ",1
395,"Need help finding a series from my youth!So I seem to recall I read a book about a young Street thief who is taught through a guild how to become a better thief and pickpocket, like the kids had to practice on razor covered mannequins.

396,"My best friend hates genre fiction.My best friend hates genre fiction. This isn't a criticism of her; people like what they like and can, like my friend, be very outspoken about the things they don't. We mostly don't talk about books these days, because she's convinced that genre fiction is bad, and that's, like, roughly 95% of what I read. I know I'm not portraying her in the most flattering light, but she's actually a terrific person. She also consumes plenty of fantasy in the form of TV and movies and games -- just not books.

""The prose is just bad,"" is generally what the argument always devolves into. I mean...sometimes, sure, but not always. Far from always! Granted, I went through a Dragonlance phase in high school, and yeah, the writing was...maybe not that great. (You can't see me, but I'm making a face right now.) I talked about that stuff pretty incessantly when we were teenagers, and I'm sure whatever books I tried to gift her probably didn't help, either, as they were more to my taste than hers. But hey, teenagers. Also that was over a decade ago.

Back then, she mostly enjoyed classics, Virginia Woolf in particular, and preferred books about women (and probably still does). She likes metaphors and deeper meanings and literary analysis. I don't have any recent info on what she enjoys reading. Honestly, I'm not even sure she has any interest in branching out and I don't want to be *that* kind of gifter, so I'm not technically asking for recommendations *for her*.

But! What might you suggest for someone like her, if they *were* interested? (Edited to add: Though it seems we'd probably also disagree over what we consider ""good"" prose.)

I'm also interested in hearing whatever thoughts you have, or stories you want to share!


Edit: I did briefly consider Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, but it basically revolves around two dudes, so. Also, I DNF'd it when I tried to read it ages ago, but have been thinking about trying to give it another shot.

**I just want to clarify:**

1) I'm not looking for books to recommend to my friend as I'm not in the habit of pushing things on people who're not interested, but I am curious about what you think would appeal to similar readers. It's for me! I'm the one who's going to be reading the books you suggest!

2) She brings it up on her own, mostly prompted by discussions the rest of us are having about recent film/TV adaptations -- I'm not hounding her about it or anything. I think people should be able to read what they like without judgment from other people. The blanket statement about bad prose bothers me, but I don't engage.",1

401,"QTL Review: The Shadow Saint by Gareth HanrahanThe Shadow Saint, by Gareth Hanrahan, is the second book in The Black Iron Legacy series. Given that it is the second book, you probably shouldn’t be reading a review or a synopsis of it if you haven’t read the first book, The Gutter Prayer, but I’m not your dad so you can do whatever you want, man. That said, spoilers lie ahead for the first book and you should venture forth at your own peril. 

Our story picks up soon after the close of the first novel, with our previous protagonists mostly either dead or fundamentally changed by their experiences. The appearance of the New City, due to the Gutter Miracle from book one, and the fall of the alchemical stranglehold of the guild and their Tallowmen, have thrown Guerdon into chaos. For those familiar with the city, it’s pretty much business as usual. Unfortunately, that is about to change when the Godswar finally comes to Guerdon. 

One of my minor complaints in my review of the previous book, was that the rest of the world felt a little underdeveloped compared to all of the information and history we received about Guerdon and its place in the world. We knew that there was a death empire called Haith, but little else about it. We knew that Ishmere was perpetrating a “godswar” that was causing a massive influx of refugees, but outside of a couple of chapters and descriptions of the various horrors, we never got a chance to experience them. In The Shadow Saint, all of that changes. It almost felt as if Hanrahan heard the (very mild) criticism, and decided that if we wanted to know about the rest of the world, then we’d best buckle up for book two. Saint packs so much worldbuilding and information into its runtime, without feeling bloated at any point, that I am frankly amazed. I have a much better understanding of the world and how it functions after this book, and it all felt surprisingly important to the overall plot. Ishmere is the one small exception to this because while we did get more of a glimpse into individual Ishmerians and their choices and beliefs, the actual society still feels a little blank. 

On the other hand, we have the empire of Haith. Normally I would briefly go over all of the various factions in my paragraph about worldbuilding, but I am so enthralled with and enraptured by the idea of Haith that I just need to gush about it for a little bit. Haith is an “eternal empire” run by necromancers (necromancers are so hot right now). Instead of worshipping gods, their power instead comes from the creation of magical artifacts they refer to as phylacteries. These phylacteries are held by the head of an individual noble house and contain the souls and accumulated knowledge and experience of all those who have held the artifact before. Think Avatar the Last Airbender, with each phylactery granting the holder knowledge of thousands of their greatest ancestors rather than the previous avatars. The moments that we see this in the book are incredibly cool and I loved the descriptions of how the character going through this moment experienced it personally. As I mentioned before, only the previous wielder of the phylactery can transfer their soul into it and become Enshrined, the highest class in Haith. Beneath the Enshrined, we have the Vigilant; individuals whose souls are bound to their bodies after death and become magical living skeletons forever working toward the betterment of the Empire of Haith. Needless to say, the concept of legions of skeleton warriors led by necromantic superhumans against a nation of mad warring gods is pretty far up my alley, and I absolutely loved it.

I also loved Hanrahan’s improvement in terms of the plot. I mentioned in my last review that while The Gutter Prayer was a fun ride, I felt the plot could be directionless and meandering at times before it finally found its stride. The Shadow Saint felt like it noticeably addressed this issue with a much more cohesive and streamlined plot. I’m not sure how much of it was my preexisting knowledge of the city of Guerdon and the characters that live there, and how much of it was Hanrahan smoothing out the hiccups from the previous installment, but the pacing and engineering of the plot is spot on in The Shadow Saint. However, I did feel that the actual climax happened rather quickly – but I think that was more a result of the sheer amount of things happening than any mechanical failing on Hanrahan’s part.

I’d like to wrap up with a note on the prose and descriptions. Hanrahan has a gift for describing the miraculous and horrifying in a way that makes it easy to imagine and hard to forget. In a book that is about warring gods and saints, miraculous massacres of undead bone soldiers, and a living city that was created by magic everything still manages to feel real and weighty. I could envision every stilling of the waters by the Kraken, and the descriptions of the Smoke Painter drawing glowing sigils in the sky that turned those that looked at them mad clicked with the part of me that loves cosmic horror and the rabbit hole of the SCP Foundation wiki. I need more of this world in my life, and I hope that Hanrahan decides to continue this world’s story whether it revolves around Guerdon and the characters from this series or not. I had a ton of fun reading this book. The Shadow Saint is a stellar sophomore effort and I can only hope that Hanrahan continues his skyward trajectory from here. I will be on the lookout for more news on the world of The Black Iron Legacy, and I desperately hope that I get the opportunity to return to this world sometime in the future. As it stands, we already have two fantastic books and I cannot recommend highly enough that you bump this series to be next in line on your reading schedule. 

Rating: The Shadow Saint – 9.0/10

I fell in love with the character of Karigan, and felt 100% thrown when, in book five, she gets thrown into this alternate future.  But I trusted the author and thought it was a daring move. I trusted her to really tie it all together in the last book.

But as I neared the last 50 pages, I realized there was NO WAY she had enough room to explain how Karigan fixed all the time line stuff, esp with Amberhill.  I mean, I know the author did technically tie up the loose ends, I just thought it was kind of .... cheap.  I felt a lot of badass parts of the story got robbed of badass conclusions. 

I still LOVE Karigan as a character and I’m glad I read the series bc I loved it so much.  My feelings about the ending have just been eating at me, and i literally don’t know anyone else who has read it.

Execution: ⭐⭐⭐⭐💫  
Enjoyment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐💫

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We live in an era where ships can slip into the opaque folds of the universe, and sail along the fringe ripples of time. We can generate muscle tissue, &amp; spool the threads into new limbs. Sunder continents with a single YonSef explosive device. Life has changed, but not our capacity for absurd cruelties.

When I began reading The Vanished Birds, I was unsure what to expect. The blurb didn’t prepare me for the book’s content, and hardly brushed the primary themes. Jimenez explores not just the idea of a found family, but, more importantly, discusses the ways we can be driven to hurt those we love. He has written a severe, yet tasteful, critique of the idea that the ends can ever justify the means. 

The novel opens with a sort of extended prologue, set on a resource planet whose inhabitants farm a sweet bean-paste called dhuba. The planet is contracted under the Umbai corporation, who manage nearly all of inhabited space. The planet’s inhabitants have a culture surrounding the highly anticipated Shipment Day, when the representatives of the Umbai corporation come to trade in exchange for the dhuba they’ve harvested and pounded into a delicacy experienced only by the wealthiest on the City Planets. However, it hasn’t always been that way. Once, the people on this planet had a rich, vibrant culture of which dhuba was only a small part. We see that pattern play out across multiple planets throughout the book; the destruction via economic blackmail to force a group to either conform or die. In either case, their culture and way of life is erased. 

It’s on this planet and its dhuba that we meet Ahro. He appears as a comet, striking the planet’s surface and coming from parts unknown - and I mean that quite literally. He does not speak their language. In fact, he does not speak at all. The traumas he has endured are, as yet, locked inside him. His appearance causes quite the stir, until the village’s governor, Kaeda, takes him under his wing. 

&gt;It was a boy. His body was the only one they found at the site. All else was hot and black. “He was just there,” Elby said, “lying next to the rubble.” Bruised and bleeding, but not broken, the boy was brought to the doctor’s house, where his glancing wounds were cleaned with wet cloth and wrapped in soft bandages. He was a small, skinny thing—no older than twelve. Cheeks gaunt, his flesh so emaciated Kaeda winced, worried that if the boy tried to stand, his leg bones would snap in half. But there was no fear of him standing, for the boy was in a deep sleep, unstirred even by the loud and frantic conversation of everyone around him.

For the first half of the novel, Ahro’s story is primarily told through the eyes of others. First, we follow Kaeda as he grows from a young child into an adult and the governor of his village. Kaeda’s story sets the stage for life on a resource planet, and also serves to introduce us to Nia, the captain of the ship that delivers the dhuba to and from the City Planets. Due to the way that the ships navigate time and space, the time between Shipment Days from the perspective of Kaeda is amplified to become years, whereas only months pass for Nia. The two meet when Kaeda is just a young boy, a child, whom Nia gifts a flute. Years later, Nia meets him as a young man… and they fall, just a bit, in love. Kaeda is unreserved in his love, thinking on Nia incessantly even during the years between their meetings. Nia, however, has been broken several times over and finds it difficult to access that part of herself. 

Due to the time compression/dilation that occurs during space travel, Nia has lost everyone she loves and cares for. Her small crew is all she has left in the world, really, though she’s acquaintances with the crew of other ships on similar contracts. However, when Ahro comes into her life, she’s thrown into an open-ended contract that may never end. She’s bonded with the boy, and she has begun to use him as a replacement for the family that she lost. In choosing to stay with the boy, she pushes away the crew that has been her interim family and finds herself again in the company of strangers. In Ahro, however, she finds a companion. His songs speak to her heart. 

&gt;She learned his mannerisms. How his right foot tucked itself behind his left leg when he ate, and how he picked at his nails when he was nervous. How he tugged at his hair with impatience—hair that they had by that point sheared off, leaving an inch of black on top—and how, when he dropped a plate or bumped into her or messed up whatever small task she had assigned him, his shoulders would hunch as if braced for a blow. And in these moments, she would catch a glimpse of his past. A history of silence that existed long before the trauma of the wreckage. A learned pain.

In a second thread of storyline that only occasionally overlaps with that of Nia and Ahro, we have the architect of the City Planets: Fumiko Nakajima. The Millenium Woman. Through the use of cold-sleep stasis, she has artificially extended her lifespan far beyond that of a standard human. This, however, comes with a price: each time she is awoken, she’s lost a bit more of herself and of her memories. She’s haunted by dreams of a purple-eyed woman who she knows that, once, she loved. Although she's lost Dana's name, she still feels her presence. When she’s not staving off the phantoms, she’s singularly focused on her projects. Ahro, ultimately, becomes one of them. 

&gt;There was a story in Dana’s face—a forgotten myth, of a deer who for one night turned into a man and made love to a human woman by a cold-water brook, in the dark heart of a forest. A strange ancestry that revealed itself in the dramatic contours of Dana’s cheekbones, her jaw—the way the lower half of her face projected forward just a nudge, a hint of a snout, and on that projection, a flattened nose, positioned just above the wide set of her lips.

Fumiko suspects that Ahro harbors a unique ability, based on his manner of arrival on the resource planet. She thinks that he is the next step in humanity’s evolution: he holds the potential to traverse the stars in the blink of an eye. To Jaunt, she calls in, a small reference to King’s short story. However, due to his age and the trauma she’s undergone, she can’t confirm it… which is why she hired Nia to stay with him and care for him at the fringes of the galaxy. 

As Ahro’s past is uncovered and the team see more and more of the resource planets, it becomes ever clearer to the reader just how much of an iron grip the Umbai corporation holds the universe in. Enclaves of artisans wiped out when they refused to kowtow to the Umbai corporations demands. Rural communities reduced from rich, vibrant communities to factories whose only use is skinning eels. And so on and so forth. 

&gt;For every mistake, a beating. A breaklet wand thrown against the rib, cracking the bone &amp; re-fusing it in moments, leaving behind only the memory of the fracture, the body still able to perform its due tasks. A beating, for not breathing properly. It was a world that valued self-control in all aspects. Even now he could hear it: the peculiar click when the wand extended from its sheath. The red light on its tip, like an eye, and the buzzing sound, like a chitinous bug. When Nia asked him if he was okay, he flinched. “Yes,” he said.

The themes and stories told were shockingly poignant. Everyone has a trauma lurking in their past, which has caused them to make the decisions they do in the present tense. I had expected a magical realism novel with scifi flavor, and instead was treated to the horrors of capitalism run rampant. I highly recommend this book, but be warned that it is not a light or easy read.

I would like to track down these books to read again. Googling gives no results as all I can remember are very vague details.

Anyway the books were set in a low magic fantasy world were a young man joins the army. The mans family are night sheep ranchers, I cant remember the exact name of the animals, these sheep are sheered for their silk which is very strong. The main character actually gets a mask made of the stuff that is bullet proof. Anyway the army is based on American civil war type tactics with cavalry charges and that type of thing and they get invaded by a country or people that have more magic based weaponry. One example I can remember is a crystal shard thrower that is basically a machine gun that uses sand that is turned into crystals to fire. As mentioned I can only remember very vague details, any help would be greatly appreciated.

I name Alecius seems to ring a bell as the main characters name but I'm really not sure.

406,"Seraphina's Lament by Sarah Chorn - Another feminist grimdark classic in the makinghttp://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1768-seraphinaslament

4.5/5

SERAPHINA'S LAMENT is one of those books that is very difficult to describe because it doesn't fall into traditional fantasy tropes. If I had to describe its tropes by analogy to other fantasy works then I would just sound insane. Don't believe me? The closest thing I can think of is, ""Stalinist Russia meets Avatar: The Last Airbender."" If that sounds like something hard to picture, that's kind of my point. The fact it's not a re-tread of Tolkien, Conan, or even George R.R. Martin gives this automatic props, though.

The premise is that a fantasy communist government has risen to power in the Sunset Lands. The dictator Eyed has murdered the previous ruling family, outlawed religion, forced all of the population onto collective farms, and put all subversives into prison camps where they are worked to death. It's blatantly Stalinism and I have to say I approve because sometimes it seems fiction ignores just how bad it was underneath communist rule.

The fantasy element is that a small segment of the population possesses Elemental Magic (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, and so on) that has traditionally been used to keep starvation at bay. These individuals are hunted by the government since they are something that can save (or so they think) the country from its current famine. The famine, of course, being caused by combination of natural disasters as well as the Eyed government's gross mismanagement. Not exactly the sort of thing you tend to see in high fantasy but I was one of those people who actually enjoyed the Senate scenes in the Star Wars Prequels (and this is a hell of a lot more dramatic).

Despite the book's title, it does not follow the character of Seraphina exclusively. She is but one of many characters that we follow the struggles of. Seraphina is Eyed's slave, having been taken as a prisoner early in the war and kept for her beauty despite the fact Eyed is gay. A note on this: the book contains numerous LGBT characters as well as polyamorous relationships, highlighting that sexual mores are just different in the Sunset Lands--I always like when books do this. Other characters include Seraphina's brother, a cannibal ghoul, Eyed himself, and a few more other interesting characters.

This is a dark-dark fantasy novel and I fully recommend it for the fact that it shows grimdark doesn't have to be just a pejorative. This is a book that deals harshly with things like mass suffering, tyranny, struggle, tragedy, and the desperation that drives one to revolution. The rebels aren't plucky heroes, either, but desperate individuals fully capable of extreme measures. Again, I like the anti-communist tone of things as I feel that gets overlooked as a potential source of fantasy baddies. It reminds me that I really need to get on that steampunk novel of mine where the villains are the fantasy Confederacy.

Sarah Chorn is a great new author and manages to tell a bleak but engaging story from beginning to end. I have a big love for sharing feminist grimdark stories and I'm sorry that I wasn't familiar with her books before making my initial list of them. I can tell you that I'm definitely adding her to my recommendations, though. Is there anything readers should be cautious of? Well, it's a dark-dark and gloomy storyline. If you don't want to deal with reading about peasants suffering mass famine and the murder of royal toddlers by deranged revolutionaries, you may want to give this one a skip. Seraphina's fire magic will eventually burn brightly but you have to wade through a lot of gloom to get there.",1
407,"Plausible Fantasy Books?Hey all, I quite like books that are more historical, such as Shogun by James Clavell or Zorro by Johnston McCulley. But even more than that, I like books that weave in some fantasy, such as The Winter King by Bernard Cornwell, or really anything by Guy Gavriel Kay—my favourite author.

What I love about those books is that there's a sense of mystery to them. Since they aren't strictly historical, the plot could go anywhere. And since they're technically fantasy, for all we know, some of the myths that the characters believe in may actually be true. Still, though, even if there is magic (or ghosts or whatever) I love how these plots are decided by very human things. No spell or sword decides the outcome of a battle. The magic, if there is any, is there more as a seasoning, not the base of the dish (unlike something like Lord of the Rings).

Whenever I try to find book recommendations, I either keep being recommended alternate history or historical fiction, which isn't quite what I'm looking for. I want something in an imagined world. Or I get recommended grimdark, but I'm not looking for a more brutal version of history/fantasy, I'm looking for a more romanticized version of history/fantasy (more of a Conan or Zorro).

Do you know of any other great authors who write in this genre?

Edit: Luis McMaster Bujold is another great example of this. Curse of Chalion is another of my all-time favourites.",1
408,"Books with the ""Family Business"" trope?Just finished watching the first season of Peaky Blinders and halfway through the season I realized one of the reasons why I was enjoying it so much. I like the trope of family business. 

Doesn't have to be a ""business"" per se but anything where a family, related by blood or marriage, works towards the same goal. I specify the blood/marriage aspect of it because otherwise it's just a ""Found Family"" trope, which I also enjoy but don't necessarily want to read right now.

The only book I can think of that fits and that I've read recently is the Kholin family from The Stormlight Archive.",1
409,"Any good, deep books with excellent worldbuilding, loads of lore and thousands of pages to read through?I really, really enjoy ASOIAF.

I want to be able to know the name of the the great grandfather of a character not integral to the plot and know at what hour he visited the damn toilet. 

All jokes aside, I really want to fully immerse myself in a world and learn all there is to learn about it. 

Preferrably, but not a requisite, is that I don't really like messed up names like for example ""iqr'an kalzeel PokLok'kradeer"" because that just makes it unecessarily harder to remember the names and characters behind them


Any suggestions, guys?

First of all, the characters, are all grey. No black and white here. You feel for the children of the Gods as much as you feel for the people of Weep. Notable exceptions being, Theon and the original 6 gods.

The way the author weaves the story gives us a look at the character in full. We know their past and their present and we know why they choose to be the way they are.

Lazlo - the most adorable character. You can feel the struggles he went through for the early 50 or so pages. And I was screaming in my mind for it to stop, so moving it was.

The five children - They are like every other child. They have wants and desires. The only thing they have got is themselves and I so want them to come out safe at the end.

The people of Weep and Tizerkane - They did what they had to do to throw their oppressors off. They had the right to be free. They did not have the right to kill the children and the babies. And this is what infuriates me. It's difficult to hate or love them. I am going to stay neutral.

The golden son - What is his play? Seems as if he is made out to be an antagonist. Is there a good side to him?

Overall, it has been a wild ride half way through. I am starting to feel that the tragedy in this book somehow is equal to that which I felt during Fitz's journey in the Realm of the Elderlings. And I am not sure if I am ready for that. Lazlo seems to be the key to everything.

So at the end, my question to all who have read this beautiful book is whether I should continue? Is there light at the end of the tunnel for the children?",1
416,"I don't care about Hard or Soft magic systems. Give me competing ones!I know some people have strong opinions in fantasy on whether they prefer hard or soft magic systems. But I especially like the stories where no matter how hard or soft you get (that's what she said) the really complicated thing is when there are different ways of doing magic that don't always align and force people to rethink things. Examples include: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Powder Mage Universe** \- Probably the most explicit example I think of. In this world magicians known as ""Privileged"" have nearly God-like powers and thus are the political elite across every society and there's not much you can do. It's their world, we just live in it. That is until people begin discovering that some people can magically use gun powder to do all sorts of neat things like get temporary super powers or shoot a bullet over a mile with accuracy. All of a sudden Privileged become very vulnerable and that totally upsets the balance of power across the world and it leads to a different sort of arms race as various factions try to counter forces that are made up of Privileged, Powder Mages, or mixed groups.
2. **Discworld** \- This is a little different because the magic is the same but there are totally different approaches in how to approach it. And since this Discworld the aim is usually on how to prevent people from using magic rather than showing off what you can do. In Ankh-Morpork you have the Wizards of Unseen University who have developed an elaborate hierarchal system where the Wizards are kept content by having all their material needs met while also making it clear they'd rather out-maneuver each other politcally than actually practice any magic. Meanwhile the Witches of Lancre rely on a very informal structure but one where Granny is definitely not in charge but you don't want to do anything she wouldn't approve of. And that gives witches a bunch of freedom to do what they want compared to the wizards but that also means they'll try to solve any problem with head-ology first and magic last. 
3. **Malazan** \- Because there's no idea Steven Erikson won't turn up to 11 you not only have several 'warrens' or domains of magic that are so vast most people only attempt at master one you also have ancient holds that existed before the warrens and are still sometimes used. Then you have elder warrens which are racial-specific to different species and can be inaccessible to others. Then you have spirit magic that can use local spirits or shamanistic practices that exist locally. Then you have some one-offs even beyond that that can't neatly fit into any of the several things I mentioned before. And it all plays out in the story as characters have to react to these different systems and sometimes get very harsh lessons in what happens when you ignore certain types of magic because you believe them inferior. 

These are the examples that quickly come to mind though I'm sure there are more. What are some of your favorite ideas of different/conflicting magic systems and how that affects a story?",1
417,"I’m a few chapters into The Wolf’s Call and I’m loving it!!This may come across as a bit biased because I loved Blood Song, Tower Lord and Queen of Fire, but I’m having so much fun reading The Wolfs Call!! 

It very much feels like an epilogue to The Ravens Shadow trilogy as well as continuing Vaelin’s adventures. I really enjoy that certain characters haven’t had a happy ending and ridden off into the sunset, it adds a new layer to the original trilogy. 

I’m also really enjoying that after everything, Vaelin has become quite a pessimistic character, it’s a natural progression to his character. 

Also as much as I liked the multiple POVs in Tower Lord and Queen of Fire, it’s so refreshing to have Vaelin as the sole POV once more. 

I would seriously recommend it so far as the start is a bit of a slow burn but it’s wonderful to see how everything has changed and to delve deeper into the world of Blood Song once again!!",1
418,"The Witcher - The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski - A DiscussionI placed a hold at my library for The Last Wish back in October and finally got the book last week. I finished it in two days and have been mulling it over for a while.

I haven't played the games, but I watched the Netflix show when it came out. I liked the show - it had just the right amount of not-taking-itself-too-seriously, catchy songs, jokes, and weirdness for me. I also adore Henry Cavill in everything he's been in, so getting to see him as Geralt was an added bonus. 

THE BOOK: I read it in English, and it made me wish I was fluent in Polish so I could read it in the original language. The writing style reminded me of Glen Cook's Chronicles of the Black Company - not too descriptive, relying on the reader to read between the lines. I felt, though, that some of the nuance of the original language was likely lost. For example, there were some parts that seemed like they should be tongue-in-cheek, but that didn't come through clearly. Does anyone have any other thoughts/info about this?

There was a lot of casual sexism, which didn't sit well with me (though some of it seemed tongue-in-cheek). The biggest example was when Geralt and Stregobor were discussing the 'monstrous' women of the Black Sun, there was an exchange along the lines of: ""the girls are short-tempered and prone to mood swings"" with a reply of ""how is that different from other women?"" Like, really? Women can't control their emotions? Barf. (Side note: I liked how much of the exact book dialogue the show used, especially from this scene.) Another example is when describing Yennefer's outfit, she wears a purse big enough only for ""a handful of coppers and a lipstick."" It felt so much like a diminution of Yennefer's power and prestige, reducing her to someone so vapid as to need a lipstick with her at all times. However, the later discussion of the pressures of her profession to look a certain way quells most of my annoyance at that line.

I liked the changes in the show that gave the female characters more social standing, agency, and power, like Calanthe being a queen and general in her own right, as opposed to the book that states that a woman could not rule Cintra alone. 

There were a lot of things about the book I really liked. First, the Cook-like expectation of the reader to fall into the story without too much hand-holding and exposition (I'm currently reading the Stormlight Archive and it's the exact opposite). I love not having every thought and motivation spelled out for me. Even important plot events, like &gt;! Geralt ""condemning"" himself to Yennefer with his final wish !&lt; were not hashed out entirely - the phrasing is vague enough to allow for imagination. Second, the blending of fairy tale into a grittier narrative. I loved the constant references to well-known fairy tales and the overall dark fairy tale feel of the story with the added dread of fearsome creatures. Third, Sapkowski wrote one of my new favorite lines about Geralt and Yennefer &gt;! after Geralt's wish: ""they were caring and tender, although neither quite knew what caring and tenderness were."" !&lt; I think that phrase says more about those two characters than any other description. 

I also liked Dandelion's character, Geralt's interactions with Roach, the descriptions of his witcher powers, and the bizarre timeline. It struck me as odd, though, how different the show and book are when Geralt was talking to Filavandrel &gt;! when Geralt was very clear about himself not being human in the show, in the book Geralt never makes that distinction.!&lt; It had neat implications for how that interaction played out in both versions.

Unfortunately, my library doesn't have the rest of the series as ebooks, so I might just have to bite the bullet and buy the whole series!

This post ended up way longer than I anticipated; thank you for reading. I'd love to hear other thoughts and interpretations!

Edit to add: not a single instance of Geralt saying ""fuck."" I was disappointed.",1

421,"My perspective on Eragon-Arya# My perspective on Eragon-Arya

Hello everyone

i just finished rereading for 2nd time the Inheritance Cycle. First time i read it was 7-10 years ago i think... Now im 25 years old..

I finished the 4rth book 5 hours ago and i have to say im so fuckin depressed i cannot calm down i feel a major gap now that i dont have another book to dive into but most importantly that Arya and Eragon did not end up together for the time being .. i am so heartbroken really...

So i would like to share my opinion on their relationship and state why i dont agree with the people that liked the ending and disliked arya and eragon being together..

Many people in relevant threads have delved into the issue and have made some nice observations i will talk about how i view their relationship during the whole series...

I think that at first Eragon was indeed impulsive and very human in his intentions for Arya but we cant deny that his feelings were so deep from the start and only became stronger as time progressed..

However, as time progressed and during all of their adventures Eragon hugely progressed as well...

So why i think that Arya loves him as well and they fit together??

First because their background story seems kinda the same meaning that sense of duty and family problems have been the major drivers behind the events of their lives...

As Eragon engaged into hardships and trained alongside Oromis and Glaedr he matured so much... From the start of the series he had talent and he was unique despite his impulse behavior and his initial weakness..but he grew so much he became skilled in war and physique and magic, he became wise and knowledgeable about history he developed amazing manners and education and intelligence, he always had amazing ethics towards other species and dilemmas and amazing decision making in terms of everything..

Arya might have been initially driven by duty towards him and thought of him as an impulse human being but she soon realized that he was special and had so deep feelings for her.. Eragon strived to know her and please her many times he tried to do some great romantic gestures to express his interest and i think that those gestures like drawing pictures of her, offering her little presents created by magic but related with nature ,his remarks about nature and species and overall his curiosity to learn and evolve as a human his bravery, his sacrifices and his sense of duty that resembled hers made her to really notice him and start loving him romantically.

They both loved being surrounded by only small groups of people and enjoyed solitude and trips.

Arya has done many things that indicate that she loves Eragon.. She always wanted to go help him or save him she gradually opened towards him and told him many things about her life and personality even though we know that she is secretive.. Every gesture of Eragon i think that moved her deeply in her inside and she would really like to spend time with him and try being together especially in the end but they have different responsibilities for now i agree that she couldnt not have been written as accepting the queens position but Paolini can lead them to being together in the next 50-100 ... i dont think that age is that big of a problem Eragon has become across the course of Inheritance an amazing individual in terms of everything imagine what he will become after training with all Eldunaris and new dragons and also with Glaedr because the gold dragon said that after the end of Galbatorix he would train them for more than 10 years to learn everything..

Arya and Eragon are meant to be together guys read the books again and check their moments and the gestures of Eragon.. Moreover, their dragons will be romantically involved as well i think that the sentiment draws from the sentiment of their Riders but the romance of the dragons will reinforce the love of Eragon and Arya as well... they have exchanged true names as well... Arya knew about Eragon“s feelings but not about the depth of his love and she realized all of these right then and there and them she knew that deeply she always loved Eragon... i think that the picture during their meeting by the river moved her more than anything...

Eragon will either come back but i think that Arya eventually will go meet him after many Riders in all species have established their position in Alagaesia and safeguarded interspecies peace... Maybe they will return for one last time to say goodbye to their old dying friends like Nazuada, orik and roran and then they will live afar for centuries continuing the training of new Riders but at the same time living their long desired love... I envision a matured Eragon 100 years ago in a place like Vroengard sitting alone in the forest practicing his magical understanding of the world around him and some distance away saphira training new dragons along with elves and then suddenly he notices far away the known feeling of his favorite consciousness in earth after Saphira... a consciousness that he had a very long time to feel and thought he would never feel again..and suddenly inside his mind he would feel the voice of Arya whispering his true name and turning back he would see the green wings of Firnen approaching and on top of Firnen Arya being more beautiful than he have ever seen her and she would give him the deepest happiest smile.. Eragon would Saphira and say “ Saphira...They came...They are here...She is here...”

422,"Examining the books that introduced us to fantasy (short &lt;5 min survey)Hello folks! There's been a lot of discussion about the concept of ""intro"" fantasy books in recent weeks and so it seemed like a good time to try and drill into the data behind this. A lot of people seem to feel that certain books will function better as ""introduction"" books for new fantasy readers, for various reasons. I thought it would be interesting to examine whether or not this is the case in practice. It'll also be interesting to see which books come up a lot, and if there's any correlation between these books and how long ago the reader first ""got into"" fantasy

So I've put a short survey together, which should only take about 3 or so minutes to complete. The link to the survey is here: [https://forms.gle/p4xPusUAtRaHV1pZA](https://forms.gle/p4xPusUAtRaHV1pZA).

The results will likely inform an essay or something similar that I'll be sure to post here when surveying is complete. I've also posted this over on Twitter, and encourage anyone to share the form in other fantasy-adjacent communities (Facebook groups, forums, discord chats, etc) if they want to or are able to, so that this can cover a wider area and increase the sample size.

What we're asking here is that you think of the book which really set you on your path as a fantasy reader. It might not necessarily be the first fantasy book you ever read, but will perhaps the one that you can look at as a ""turning point"" or a ""lightbulb moment"". 

I'll also be asking if there were any particular books or series — perhaps those which are more popular or commonly-recommended — which you may have disliked or bounced off of before finding your gateway book.

Hopefully the data received will be informative, and there might be some interesting correlations that we can examine after the fact!

Thanks for participating, and please feel free to tell the story of you found your fantasy gateway in the comments!",1
423,"Grimdark and feminism - Women's stories and tragedyI've been recommending feminist grimdark reads (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/emu709/feminist_grimdark_some_recommendations_by_me/?st=k5e0ypbo&amp;sh=37f78a08) and some people have brought up the idea that this was inherently contradictory. Their view being that grimdark is not only popularized by but inherently defined by violence toward women. I thought I would share some thoughts on that view.

I think feminism is something that is a bit broader in fantasy writing than a lot of people give it credit for. Take the controversial writing of George R.R. Martin for example. One of the reasons that Game of Thrones had such a mixed reception from a feminist criticism is because of a central irony.

Lots and lots of bad stuff happens to female characters. However, a large reason that GRRM got so much slack from a lot of circles is the fact that the bad stuff that happens to female character is dealt with as part of the female character's journeys and not as an adjunct to a male character's saga. To reduce it to its crassest one-dimensionality: A woman who is assaulted and a man avenges her is a very different story than a woman who is assaulted and dealing with the trauma thereof.

Women are not delicate flowers who shy away from darkness and violence (sexual or otherwise--but I don't think sexual violence is inherently more ""grimdark"" than personal tragedy or PTSD, that's just a bad stereotypie). My wife reads some of the most grimdark stuff I've ever seen in my life and it's written by women for women. However, they do have very little patience for stories that use it as a dismissive shorthand for male character development.

One of the realizations that ASOI&amp;F lost my interest was the realization I'd also been perhaps cutting the series a bit too much slack in certain areas. Cersei Lannister is a fascinating character because I saw her as someone driven literally insane by the misogyny, rape, and abuse she suffered that she started lashing out about. NOPE. It's actually she's just a pure evil **** since childhood, unlike Jaime who is redeemable. So I started losing interest around A Feast for Crows. The treatment of Daenerys also killed my lingering love of the series.

I am much more interested in grimdark that deals with women's stories and is fundamentally ABOUT women's stories in dark and horrid environments.

424,"Is there a genre term or categorization of Fantasy/Scifi books that are at their core an exploration of something [non-fictionally] older/historical?I don't think I've done a great job explaining it so let me give two examples:

---------------------

**Hyperion** is a grand scifi story with a significant amount of worldbuilding, but it feels (and I'm 90% through, so my impressions might be slightly off) that the book is an exploration of John Keats, using the frame of scifi as a means of inspecting him. 

**Snow Crash** is a cyberpunk story where a core story element is closely related to an investigation and dialogue about the myth of the Babylonian God Marduk.

---------------

I an probably reading way too much in to this because I'm a sucker for history as well, but it feel these books have an inner kernel purpose of exploring some non-scifi/non-fantasy real world historical element/idea/person. 

Is there a term for this? A genre or category? Am I nuts?",1

426,"Dune Was My Second Chance Book - Here's How it Held UpI have a long history with Dune. Being one of my mom’s favorite books, it has been part of the scenery of my childhood. It was always on a shelf in the living room, on my mom’s nightstand, or next to the couch after she began to read it for the thousandth time. I always wanted to read it myself, and when I was about 14, I tried to do so for the first time. It… didn’t go well. I can’t remember why, but I didn’t last too long. Oh well. 

&amp;nbsp;

But then I played some of the games and saw the Lynch movie (and that movie deserves a post on its own), and my curiosity peaked again. Once again, I tried, and once again, I failed to read the book. Finally, when I was 18, I decided that I’m going to knuckle down and force myself to finish Dune and see why so many people love so much. I managed to finish this time, but I ruined the experience for myself. I was so focused on getting through that I lost sight of all the nuances that make Dune great. I couldn’t remember huge swathes of the story and constantly confused elements from the movie into it. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

So when the bingo asked us to find a book to give a second chance to, I knew which book I’m choosing. I hoped that now that I’m older, and reading the novel in the original language this time, I will finally understand what everyone sees in it. And you know what? **It kinda worked**. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing I noticed about Dune is its language. Older SFF classics often utilize overly-purple, hard to follow, and antiquated language. Not so with Dune. **The writing style is clear, modern, and easy to follow**. Herbert skillfully and succinctly paints every scene, enabling the reader to picture the setting. All without turning too poetic to follow. Reading it today, it feels as fresh and modern as any novel by Sanderson, Kay, or Martin. Back in its day, though, I’m sure Dune was nothing short of revolutionary for its use of language alone. 

&amp;nbsp;

As for the story, **it grips you quickly and efficiently as the language**. Intrigue and mysticism serve to engage the reader with a cast of characters that are all so well-defined, that you can often tell who is speaking just from their words, long before the book tells you who was the speaker. I cursed at my 18-year-old self. How could I miss out on all this wonderful writing?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

And then I got to the second part of the book, and I was like “I remember now.”

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Here’s the thing: Dune, along with Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel, belong to a small club of books that cannot be spoiled, because they spoil themselves with glee. Between precognition, multiple POV, and excerpts of Princess Irulan’s books, you will know everything that is going to happen long before it does. In the first part of the book, this is not an issue. You’ll be more interested in the how than the what, and reading becomes this giant puzzle to see how everything fits with what you’ve been told. But early in the second part, there is an entire chapter where Paul tells Jessica what’s going to happen to them, and then it just… happens to them. Multiple action scenes that hold no tension and very little interest follow, only for everything to end up where you knew it would. It’s not bad, just lacking in comparison to the first part. And **if you happen to be a teen with little patience or eye for nuance, it’s easy to lose interest in the book**.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

By the third part of the novel, Dune gets back on its track, and the true purpose of the story is revealed. Without wishing to spoil, I will only say that Dune is a story that takes a very different approach to the Chosen One narrative than one might expect. **The implications of the events offer some real dilemmas for the readers to ponder long after reading**.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Dune is great, have no doubt about it**. And by great, I don’t mean just good, but also that it deserves the influence it had over speculative fiction. The source of its greatness is the same thing that made it so hard to adapt to other forms of media: the nuances.  Herbert envisioned a future humanity might head towards that seems banal at first glance: that AI will rise up and attempt to annihilate its makers. Except Herbert also made the incredible decision to place his tale centuries after that future takes place, to show us a version of humanity changed so thoroughly by that history that past as to seem almost alien. All of this is portrayed to the reader through countless tiny clues and references. This method of delivery allows the reader to immerse themselves in the story while constantly discovering more things about the world. **It is, and I don’t use this word lightly, genius**.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


The nuances are also present for the characters. Yes, Paul is a Gary Stu, but also, he really isn’t if you read carefully. The cast that accompanies Paul is likewise complex and exemplifies how even after all the years and changes, **there is still a human connection between the characters and the reader, brought to life by thousands of minute details within the book**. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I left Dune this time satisfied that I got what there is to get from the book and in complete agreement with those who call it a masterpiece. It’s not without faults, but Herbert created something truly unique and complex. I’m happy I finally got to read it and finish it properly. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Dune was a book far ahead of its time**. But when something is ahead of its time, it implies that one day, the rest of the world will catch up. I think that after over 50 years, the world of literature did eventually catch up to Dune, which is part of the reason I’m less interested in reading the sequels. But while it may no longer be singular in its style and delivery, it’s still as worth your time as it did in 1965. And if you’ve tried to read it in the past but couldn’t get into it, well – I’m living proof you should try again. 

&amp;nbsp;

Tl;dr- Dune is a great read, with a unique touch of nuance that imbues the tale with incredible depth. It's worth your time today as it did in the past. However, the middle can drag a bit, and if you like surprises, you're not going to find them here.

428,"I Made My Mum Read It Too: A Review of the Rivers of London series by Ben Aaronovitch (Spoiler Free)So, I started this thing with my mum last year where we would try to find fantasy books we would both enjoy so we could buddy read them. She is far more into crime than I am, though she LOVES Harry Potter, so I figured there would be plenty of books that would suit us both. We had a whole list planned out, starting with The Rivers of London and then… we just ended up reading the whole rest of that series instead of moving on. Oops. It actually got to the point where she refused to wait for me to catch up (she reads more books per year than I do by far).

We’ve both finished now (up to the end of Lies Sleeping), so I asked my long-suffering mother for her thoughts so I could review them.

**Mum’s thoughts:** Mum found these books were very easy to read, a sort of moreish popcorn of literature. She has never been one for the super weird, and her liking of fantasy and sci-fi usually requires the story to be grounded in our world (Harry Potter) or in a beloved franchise (she read all the original canon Star Wars novels). These very firmly fit in the former, for no matter how magical and odd the stories get, they are grounded in the mundanity of police procedure and in London itself. Her favourite aspect were the rivers, and the general exploration of the idea of immortals having to stand by and watch mortals come and go around them, very like what Doctor Who always has to suffer through. Although she also had a good cackle at the bit in Foxglove Summer where&gt;! Peter has to walk back through the country town naked.!&lt;

**My thoughts:** I absolutely adored these books. They exactly filled my need for fun, interesting, never too stressful reads that it was a joy to return to. The author’s love for London comes across really well on the page, and although there are paragraphs here and there describing some place or history or fact in detail, they never felt info-dumpy, rather were interesting and added to the overall narrative. I’ve described these to people as love letters to London with a fun magical mystery on top, but they are also delightfully diverse, and delve in to the darker side of what magic could be like in the modern day if it got into the wrong hands.

Peter is a great POV character to follow through the series, not only for his dry humour but also because his honesty brings a closeness to the story that adds more depth. In the same way these books contain a lot of information about London, they also contain a lot of details about how the police force operates behind the scenes. I know SO LITTLE about such things that I can’t comment on the accuracy, but as with the London stuff it felt accurate and interesting and added to the enjoyment of the read.

My favourite aspect of these books is the scientific way they attempt to teach, understand, catalogue and even test magic, exactly as though it was just another branch of science like funky physics. Even better that in the novella, The October Man, which follows a different character in the world for the first time, you get to see the subtle differences in the scientific nomenclature that was adopted in a different country.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all we both thoroughly recommend these books to anyone who wants a fun read, a bit of modern magical crime, a new take on fae, lots of explosions, general weirdness, the occasional Harry Potter joke and a new appreciation for the sheer depth of London’s history.",1

Cooney*In Desdemona and the Deep,  the spoiled daughter of a rich mining family must retrieve the tithe of  men her father promised to the world below.

## Thoughts:

This book was fucking weird and I loved it. The end.

Just kidding, of course I have more to  say. First of all, don’t let that beautiful cover fool you–weird shit is  happening in this book and it is amazing. And also beautiful in its own unique way. I love stories of the fae when they’re all dark and weird  and they make dangerous bargains. I love when they’re other worldly and not humanized too much, like there is an almost alien feel to them, something very much not human that makes it just a bit tough to ever get a feel for them. This is done PERFECTLY in *Desdemona and the Deep*.

For such a short book there are quite a  few things explored here and yet it never feels like there’s too much packed in, or too many things going on–each element is perfectly balanced. First you have Desdemona who, at the start, you get the  feeling is a very shallow type of girl. But maybe she’s not that shallow, just very cynical due to her family and upbringing. She’s  extremely wealthy, certainly a ‘one percenter’ if you will. She’s like one of the Vanderbilts back in the day or something. Lavish parties, designer clothes, nothing but the best of the best. There's something very art deco, Great Gatsby-esque about this book to me. Anywho, her mother does charity but she sees her mother’s work through a cynical lens, her mother putting on a show instead of doing anything to make a real  difference. She’s living the high life but clearly has a lot of  emotional issues going on. But we don’t feel sorry for her, there’s no poor little rich girl here. We’re not made to empathize with her and I’m glad the author didn’t go in that direction. Instead what we get is a  great character arc as Desdemona goes on her journey with the Fae. But  the important thing, the first step, is all on her–she wants to change  things. She makes the decision. She doesn’t come to it because of  anything other than her own willingness to say ‘this isn’t right’ and  taking action. I think that’s important.

As for other characters, we have  Desdemona’s best friend, Chaz. Also one of the elites, but someone like  Desdemona who clearly has some other things going on beneath the  surface. I really liked watching Chaz’s journey too, even though we only  get to see them through the lens of Desdemona’s story and thus don’t  get to spend as much time with them as a character. The fae in this  story are beautifully grotesque and darkly mysterious, just the way I  love them. I enjoyed the fae characters we meet, trying to figure them  out. Some of them manage to inject some fun into the story, which I  appreciated because it kept things from straying too dark.

In short, I really loved this story. I  could gush about it some more but you should probably just pick up a  copy and check it out for yourself. **5/5 stars.**",1

Something about the unique magic system, strong character development and shifting perspectives, as well as the ongoing military campaign and the hints of a much larger story beyond the surface tale really made it stand out to me and I was wondering if there are any similar books.

433,"Help me find a character that’s not a robot to relate toI’m looking for book recommendations where I might relate to the main character.

Characters I have recently related to:
Murderbot, All Systems Red
M-bot, Skyward
Brittle, Sea of Rust
Clay Cooper, Kings of the Wyld 

Not thinking too hard on that fact that two of those characters are named Murderbot, can anyone suggest a book where I might relate to some actual human characters, specifically women?

Granted, Clay Cooper is human, but he’s a man. Though there is nothing wrong with male characters, as a woman I would really like to find some female characters I can relate to. As far as Clay goes, I really relate to how he thinks things through and dismisses thoughts if saying them isn’t going to do any good. He’s really intentional, pragmatic, and seems to see through other people’s nonsense to the heart of the issue.

I’m looking for rational, confident, observant characters who aren’t frequently ruled by their emotions and aren’t wishy-washy. Characters who take their time coming to conclusions, but once they make up their minds they aren’t easily swayed. More introverted, introspective, less peopley. 

I realized the other day when someone was complaining about how a few particular male authors wrote women that the reason I liked the depictions of those authors was because their women were practical and logical and generally less reactive. It would be nice to find female authors who write this kind of character.  (And please, if you’re going to go with a male author, no one say wheel of time. Most of the women there like to think they are logical and confident, but it’s a lot of bluster. So. Much. Bluster. Someone did point out Verin to me, and while she works, she’s hardly a main character).

I read a lot more male (and apparently robot) characters I relate to. Any ideas on female characters who fit this criteria?

Tl;dr: books with rational, introspective female characters who are appropriately confident without bluster/bravado

My favorite sub-genre is epic fantasy, and I’m not huge on slice of life. I like a decent amount of action and character development and depth. I’m not often in the mood for fairy tale style.",1
434,"r/Fantasy Writer of The Day: Pemry JanesHey, reddit, I’m Pemry Janes and I’ll be your writer of the day . . . today. I am the author of **The Living Sword** and its sequel, **The Living Sword II: The Road Ahead**.

I’ve always been enamored with history. When I was a kid I wanted to be a paleontologist. Unfortunately, I also detested mud and dirt so that dream died quickly.

Fantasy came into my life when I was ten or so and I have my local library to thank for it. One of the librarians suggested I try this book written by an author with a weird name, Tolkien.

After that, I jumped right in. I stayed up way too late to devour Wheel of Time, cried a little while reading the Farseer Trilogy, and was enchanted by the worlds Raymond E. Feist connected.

Writing, though, wasn’t something I thought I could do. Not for a long time. Until I found out that people wrote fanfiction. This shifted the idea of writing for me, suddenly it was something that I might also be capable of. It took a few years more before I felt confident enough in my writing to try my hand at an original work.

I aim to set my stories in fleshed out worlds, rich in background and history that might never make it to the page. The Living Sword series itself is a fun adventures series. Each book has its own story that begins and ends in that book with a larger story arc threaded throughout.

438,"how do you handle crossover between active seriesso as i bounce back and forth between various series i am finding more and more that i have trouble keeping straight the info from one to another.

for instance ive been reading the Steve McHugh Hellequin series recently but just picked up one of the latest Shayne Silvers books that i have been reading for a while now. it probably doesn't help that both main characters are named Nate but what is even worse is that several of the deities overlap as well and those gods are TOTALLY different from one series to another.

and don't get me started on tryin to keep the various Fae attitudes straight. having Maeve come up in the Dresden books then again in the top position in the Junkyard druid was not helpful. then Mab herself came up in eh Shayne Silvers books at one point and i had to think hard about which motivations i am supposed to be applying to her. and NONE of this helps when there are several months between book releases and ive just applied a whole new set of motivations that i have to get back in the mindset of.

439,"Limited edition prints of series you missed, or have never been published in that format.Like many of you here I've been reading fantasy and science fiction books for literally decades. One of my regrets during this time is not being more pro-active at trying to collect some of the limited editions of series that are closest to my heart. For example, one of my favourite series is The Malazan Empire ; when it was originally released here in the UK the first three books were never printed in hardcover format. Gardens of the Moon did eventually get re-printed as a 10th Annniversary hardcover edition, but I assume it couldn't have sold that well as the subsequent books never got the same treatment. As a consequence I have  two ""gaps"" in my hardcover collection of this series which has always irked me. 

I remember searching for Deadhouse Gates years ago, hoping for news on the release of a 10th Anniversary edition ... but nothing. It was then that I stumbled across Subterranean Press ( who I had never heard of at that point ) and noticed they had already started producing limited editions of the Malazan Series. Unfortunately, by that stage the copies of the first two books had already sold out.  As much as I liked the quality on offer from Subterranean Press I could never bring myself to buy the remainder of the series from them, as I knew the incomplete set would always rankle with me.  Honestly, I don't have OCD ... even if it sounds like it !

Another series I've craved for a long time is a limited edition hardcover, English translation of the Witcher series ; as far as I'm aware this doesn't exist anywhere. Surely there would be a huge market for this ?

I'm also disapppointed at missing out on Joe Abercrombie's First Law trilogy ( from Subterranean Press ) and find myself about a year too late to catch Mark lawrence's limited omnibus edition of The Broken Empire trilogy.

Anyone else have similar regrets, or ""wants"" for future releases ? I guess if there is a large response to a thread like this it might just encourage a publisher, or two, to explore these options. Here's hoping ! Fire away with your comments ....",1

443,"Well I just finished book 15/15 of Katharine Kerr's Deverry Cycle [Spoilers]On a quick initial side note, after finishing the 15th book an hour ago I just saw online that the author, Katherine Kerr, had her husband of 47 years die 4 days ago.  I think that's very sad.

Anyway, I just finished book 15 of 15 of the Deverry Cycle and I'm kind of overwhelmed at the scope of it.  It did go slowly in a few places but overall I'm really happy with the experience.  For those that don't know, the series started in 1986 (I believe) and its Celtic fantasy.  Its unique property was that people often reincarnated into new lives, and many of the novels had flashbacks of the ""main cast"" interacting in past lives, which shed insight into their interactions and relationships in the main time period.

I initially was worried that this property would throw me off because I didn't want to track multiple people over multiple lives, and that worry caused me to push back starting the series.  For whatever reason, though, I started it, and I'm glad I did.  Even if you sometimes forget what character is who in later lives you still get an overarching story of the kingdoms and peoples, which is fulfilling in itself.  Many of the books have charts of the reincarnations, but at least one had errors where the rows were all off by one and confused me for a bit.

My favorite aspect of the series, though, is the day-to-day nature of the lives we read about.  There's no big quest or bad guy to defeat by the end of the series that ties everything up.  While certainly characters all have struggles and obstacles to overcome, there's no central premise or theme that everything else hangs on.  When I'd start the next novel in the series it was like visiting old friends and catching up with their lives.  Sometimes they did unimportant things, sometimes they faced huge changes, but you're just interested in what's going to happen next.  It's the kind of series (for me at least) where the individual books blur together - they're less well-defined books and more individual chapters in an overarching shared universe.  Coming away from it I feel like I had an experience more than was simply told a story.

The book starts relatively narrow in its fantasy setting - medieval Celtic dealing with warriors and kings and kingdoms, but slowly starts to spread out, bringing in elves (not woodlands stereotypes, but nomads on the grasslands), dwarves, dragons, and others.  None of these races or individuals from these races dominate the series, and I personally like that in a genre where you often read about a big quest that everyone revolves around.  I can see how others might not like it.

I do have a question for people who have read it.  The Silver Daggers, in later time periods, are mercenaries everyone treats like scum.  However, in early periods, they're highly respected personal guards of the king.  Did I miss what caused them to fall out of grace?  Or is that just a story untold?

The good news is that 11 years after what was supposed to be the final novel in the series, there's a new Deverry novel coming out next month.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Having finished series an hour ago, though, I feel satisfied.  It was really fulfilling to explore this world, from where the elves came from to the politics of kingdoms.  I liked grumpy Otho the dwarf and snarky Arsozah the dragon, and Salamander the ""chattering elf.""  Rhodry in the closest thing to a main character (simply due to his prominence in the story - not that he's doing anything earth shattering per se), and he definitely has an arc from rejected nobleman to Silver Dagger to- well, you'll see when you read it.

What do other people think of Deverry?  Is the experience reading it as the books came out different than reading it mostly together at once like I did?  What are your favorite races or plot points?

edit: I was so excited to post my ideas I forgot about how much I loved the magic system - called dweomer.  I loved how it wasn't a rigidly defined or professional/scholarly craft.  Often times dweomasters were still figuring out the limits or abilities of the magic themselves, and practitioners from different races often had different insights or skills.  Some races embraced it and some races considered it only a legend.  This messy, malleable magic that the users were often still exploring themselves was really appealing.",1
444,"Why Page Count over Word Count?To clarify, does anyone know why whenever someone is referring to (or asking for) the length of a book they want to know the page count instead of the word count? Without extensive context, the page count tells you nothing of the book's actual length.

The biggest problem with the page count is that it will vary drastically depending on the format the book is being read in. A hardback, for example, is going to have far fewer pages than an EPUB being read on a cellphone. Even within eBook copies, the device and screen size is going to cause significant differences in the page count. Even when talking solely about physical books, the page count doesn't really mean anything unless you know the book's font size, the page margin size, font type, word/line spacing, and the overall  dimensions of the book. Whereas word count is consistent across all media types, formats, fonts, margins, ect.

**TL;DR** \- Because of the varying forms a book can come in, trying to determine a book's length solely on page count is about as useful as knowing someone's favorite brand of shampoo when you want to send them a text. On the other hand, word count never changes.",1

447,"Female authors in the Australian Fantasy Market: A History.Back when I was a young man and first stumbled across /r/fantasy, I was introduced to an argument that is still ongoing about diversity in the works that we have available to read. There was a consistent thread in the discussion of women authors not getting as much recognition as male authors. And that sort of matched what I remembered from high school, but this was nearly a decade later and I wasn’t seeing it anymore. Now, all those people saying that women were not as well represented could not all be wrong, but it took me years to work out what was happening.

The Australian Speculative Fiction Market is fundamentally different from the US and UK markets and has been since it became a separate market creating it’s own material. Here I (supported by some of the other Australian members of /r/fantasy) will cover the history of the Australian Market to explain how it is so different, then I will cover major female Australian fantasy authors who developed the genre in Australia and lastly I will cover the up and coming names who should be watched going forward.

Australia is a very young market for everything, but home-made speculative fiction is very recent indeed. While I don’t have a date for the first piece of speculative fiction published in Australia, our oldest set of awards is the Ditmars, a fan voted set of awards very similar in design to the Hugos. They were first awarded in 1969 (nice) and there’s a very familiar (to me) set of names who were winning the award for that first decade. In ‘78 it was first won by a woman by the name of Cherry Wilder who’s a New Zealander. I won’t hold that against them… Too much. The shortlist for the award was very short indeed for most of those early years so it was ‘85 before the list regularly had female names appearing on it. However, while I’ve been calling it a speculative fiction award, that is what it is now. In those early days it was a science fiction award because there was no locally produced fantasy. So I’m just going to skip forward another decade.

In 1995 a relatively unknown author named Sara Douglass got her very traditionally styled epic fantasy novel published. It had all the usual tropes. Barbaric northmen, quasi-medieval setting, background magic, the fate of the world at stake. The reason it is groundbreaking is because it was the first ever fantasy novel published in Australia. From the very beginning, the whole fantasy publishing industry in Australia has been making money from the success of it’s female authors.

Also in ‘95 was the start of Australia’s other speculative fiction award, the Aurealis . It is a judged rather than a voted award and while every year there will be some crossover between it and the Ditmar, it is very rare for a book to get both. In ‘96 the fantasy novel Aurealis went to a female author as did the fantasy short story. Even the science fiction Aurealis had women on the ballot from the very beginning with Kate Orman, who I’ll talk about later.

By 2005 the shortlists for both the Ditmar and the Aurealis were half and half male and female. Across every category except the YA/Children’s Aurealis which has always been mostly female. 15 years ago female authors were matching their male counterparts for recognition within the industry. I don’t have access to sales numbers but I assume that (purely within Australia) they would have been similar as well. By 2015 all of the awards lists were majority female with one year returning an all-female shortlist for the fantasy novel Aurealis. The winners are still fairly evenly split on gender.

---

There are several unique aspects of the Australian market that encourage it to be different to the US and UK markets. Perhaps the biggest that doesn’t usually come to mind is that book publishing in Australia is a protected industry. There are laws against importing already printed books into the country for bulk sale which were instituted to protect the publishing industry, but it also happens to protect the authors. Because any book sold in Australia needs to be printed in Australia, books from overseas authors cannot be printed cheaply in their home country and then imported in bulk. This means that Australian authors in their small market by worldwide standards don’t have to compete on price against authors producing orders of magnitude more copies of books. It’s worthwhile for a publisher to take a chance on a local author.

On the cultural side, Australia is a multicultural country. There’s a level of diversity across the whole continent which is hard for people not from Europe to understand. Australians are more used to seeing other people’s points of view and accepting other experiences because that’s a thing they do every day. With something like a third of the population born overseas and a public broadcaster specialising in languages other than English, a female point of view in a novel barely counts as strange. The fact that Australia imports huge amounts of media helps with this as well. Every time an Australian reader picks up an overseas fantasy novel they have to deal with lots of things outside their lived experience. Like snow, summer being a thing to look forward to, it getting colder as you go north. This is all consistent practice at seeing an outsider’s point of view.

The diversity affects the writers as well. Australian fantasy authors produce some very specific things that are almost signatures of the genre in Australia.

If you encounter a post-apocalyptic piece of art in English, it’s about 50/50 that it was made by Australians. This is not gender specific because it’s largely from the fact that large parts of Australia already look like the apocalypse has happened.

One of the largest cultural groups coming into early Australia was the Irish. They brought their myths and legends with them and this has resulted in the creation of More Irish than the Irish fantasy works. The quality of the research is better and they’re much more common out of Australia.

Interestingly, the “Women write YA” trope has never been a thing in Australia. They do, and our most famous children’s fantasy author is a woman (Emila Rodda) but the famous names in Australian YA fantasy are mostly men, like Garth Nix. Without the historical segregation and without massive local successes like J.K. Rowling, there’s no internal pressure for female fantasy authors to write YA.

Australia being a fairly small market means that Australian authors write things to fit into the larger English markets of the US and UK. Stories will be set in the northern hemisphere and traditional setting tropes that have never existed in Australian history will be used to make it familiar for those larger markets. Or, they go the other way and write the most bizarre things you’ve ever seen because the author is drawing from influences from dozens of cultures and basing works on creatures and landforms that you’ve never heard of before. I will remind you all here that when the first platypus was sent back to England, the English response was to tell Australia to “knock it off, that thing is clearly a fake”.

---

The first generation of Australian fantasy authors was basically from 1995 till 2010. These authors were inspired by overseas authors and fantasy stories and largely started out following that mold. There was no support structure for fantasy authors of either gender at that time so these people were trailblazers for the industry as a whole.

 * Sara Douglass is of course first, even if she’s not all that exciting. Over her life she wrote a decent list of very well received novels but apart from proving that Australian authors could make money out of fantasy, she didn’t do much. The Aurealis for best series is named after her.

 * Emily Rodda was writing fantasy even before Douglass, but it was for children and didn't count apparently. She did however produce a significant amount of it, in both urban fantasy (Finders Keepers) and epic fantasy (Rowan of Rin) meaning that everybody in Australia who grew up reading fantasy grew up reading from an obviously female author.

 * I said we’d get back to Kate Orman, and here’s where. Kate is famous for working with the BBC, writing Dr Who tie in novels. She was both the first woman and the first non-Brit to write stories for the Doctor. The current run of stories featuring a female Doctor is at least partially because of her work, not that she ever turned her hand to worlds of her own creation.

 * Juliette Marieller is probably Australia’s longest running female author, having started very close to Douglass and not having died yet. She is one of the biggest names in the More Irish Than The Irish crowd as she writes from her own cultural heritage. She’s also reasonably prolific, turning out only slightly less than a book a year.

 * Shannah Jay… There’s no easy way to say this, I believe Shannah Jay is a huge misandrist and the fact that some of the things that she wrote made it through the publishing industry is a clear sign that there’s no inbuilt discrimination against female writers in Australia even back when she was regularly producing books.

 * Marriane De Pierre is more of a science fiction author then a fantasy author but that line has never been very strict in Australia. She is most well known for future visions of urban Australia but does also produce contemporary set Urban Fantasy. She’s also six foot tall, unashamedly punk and left handed.

 * Kylie Chan is Australia’s best known Urban Fantasy author with her wildly successful series about the nanny to the child of the Chinese God of Martial Arts, The Snake and the Turtle, North Point of the Celestial Compass. She has recently started to branch out but it’s well worth noting that Australia’s biggest Urban Fantasy series has no vampires, no werewolves, and no detectives. It’s a clear example of Australia’s multiculturalism resulting in a more diverse local fantasy market.

 * Keri Arthur is the other half of the coin, Australia’s biggest Paranormal Romance author. Again, she has started to branch out recently, mostly because she lost her American publishing contract and is now allowed to write other things. And yes, she’s got some vampires and werewolves, but her series with the most critical acclaim is about a Phoenix. The majority of her catalogue is set in the US, but again because of the loss of her publishing contract she now writes things set in her home city of Melbourne.

 * Jennifer Fallon is known for a few different things. Fantasy novels with no magic, badarse female rulers of countries, devastation on a scale not seen since Elric blew the Horn of Fate. Even when she sets two series in the same world, each of them is very tonally different.

 * Celia Dart-Thornton is reasonably well known for writing things with really strong Celtic influences while also being slightly weird. She is well known for her works and deserves a mention along with Lynn Flewlling for putting trans themes in fantasy novels before there was a cultural acknowledgement of trans people.

 * Isobelle Carmody is another of the very first authors, and the only one I’ve actually had a chance to speak to about this. She started to write novels on her boss’ typewriter at her newspaper job which turned into a massive career because she forgot to remove the typed sheets from the typewriter when she left. Her boss read over her work and put her into contact with a literary agent and we got the Oberwertyn series. Which is most famous for having a break between the penultimate and ultimate books of about as long as the gap between Duke Nukem 3D and Duke Nukem Forever. And you people waiting for Winds of Winter and Doors of Stone think you have it bad.

 * Trudi Canavan was Australia’s first writer of Magical University stories, and is one of very few Australian authors who have an AMA on /r/fantasy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/26l6h9/hi_trudi_canavan_here_ama/). While the first series was not groundbreaking or all that great she made a strong follow up over the next few series.

---

The current generation of Australian authors covers from roughly 2010 till now. These authors started writing in an industry that already had massive local successes to look up to and an established support structure for female authors. The effects of this can be seen with a distinct move towards pushing the envelope even in their first works, where the previous generation would generally get a traditional series published before trying the weird and wonderful. There is also significantly more interaction with our Aboriginal history in this generation, with Aboriginal authors starting to get published and themes of Terra Nullius showing up in several works.

 * Thoriya Dyer takes a part of the Australian landscape that doesn’t get a lot of interest, our northern rainforests, and puts a very strange culture over the top of it.

 * Cat Sparks writes mostly short stories, but is also a major organiser of industry events in New South Wales. She’s a major driver for new authors by bringing them into contact with the industry as a whole.

 * Amie Kaufmann writes her own stories but is probably best known for her collaboration with Jay Kristoff. She’s unashamed about her own nerdity and is outspoken about it on panels.

 * Jodi McAllistar did the thing that I really wanted to see for years and years. She took all that Irish mythology that Australian authors keep using, and actually put it in the Australian bush. It didn’t actually end with the local Dreaming spirits driving off the invaders, but she’s only just finished her first series and I hold out hope for the future.

 * Sam Hawke is one of those very rare “I won both the Aurealis and the Ditmar for the same book” people. Considering it’s also her first published novel, I’m seriously surprised that she doesn’t look like a chibified version of herself at this point.

 * Devin Madson writes Asian inspired grimdark. There’s actually a fair bit of that going around in Australia. Someone to watch when she releases her next book.

Look out for spoilers!

This is a great way to start a year of reviews! 'Transformation' by Carol Berg is an excellent book. This book reminded me of 'The Curse of Chalion' in all the best ways. 'Curse' is one of my favorite books and probably one of the best Fantasy novels of all time, so this similarity is an excellent thing. This novel follows a slave as he transforms from being a broken husk of a man into a powerful (if still a bit broken) spiritual warrior.

Seyonne has been a slave for half his life. Before, he was a warrior from a tribe of demon hunters. Seyonne fought demons as a Warden, wielding potent magics in the defense of mankind. But the Derzhi empire conquered his people, and Seyonne was captured.

Seyonne was enslaved for sixteen years, breaking him in body and soul, stripping him of magic. He lost his innocence, his dignity, his self respect. He no longer tries to escape, because he's been so tainted by his slavery that his family will no longer take him back. He's traded from master to matter, beaten and tortured and raped and starved and branded. Seyonne survives by living in the moment, never thinking more than a few minutes into the future, crushed by the weight of his misery.

Until he finds his way into the household of Prince Aleksander of the Derzhi.

Aleksander is an asshole. He beats Seyonne for back talk. Aleksander murders his enemies when it's convenient. Alex's debauchery is legendary. Alex has no redeeming value, not that Seyonne cares. Seyonne has given up on life, so he doesn't care about anything.

But then demons begin attacking Aleksander.

Seyonne must make a choice: Option 1) allow the evil demons to have their victory and thereby revenge himself upon his wicked master. Option 2) fulfill his oaths as a Warden to defeat demons and save the life of the man who regularly beats Seyonne, sometimes nearly to death. Thematically this was a compelling choice, by putting the completely miserable Seyonne in a position where he's given a choice of damnations.

Now to talk about the nuts and bolts of the book.

I liked the prose. At moments quite beautiful, the prose was a delight to read.

The pacing was good overall, but a bit unstable. I liked the slow-but-steady pacing the book began with, but slightly disliked how it sped up greatly at the 2/3's mark. I would have liked it better if it were a slower burn towards the end.

The book's narrative structure was okay. I felt as though Seyonne's and Aleksander's character arcs were slightly too sped up. I don't say this very often, but in this case I think this book could have been longer. I would have liked if the story had another 50-100 pages to flesh out the character development. To be sure it doesn't *need* those extra pages. The book felt crisp and lean, excellent traits in a novel. But a little more time for the characters to grow and form a relationship would have been welcome.

And to be sure, the characters are the highlight of this book. Seyonne must recover his sense of self-worth after a decade and a half of slavery, and Aleksander must learn to be a decent human being for the first time in his entire life. And those character arcs were a delight to read.

The setting was sorta-Russian inspired, specifically Tzarist Russia invading the interior of Asia and conquering it using flintlocks and military strength... or at least that's the feeling I got. This is a secondary world fantasy, so there is no direct parallel to a place and time on earth.

But this book ain't perfect. My biggest problem was that the plot felt like two arcs stapled together. Not to get into any details, but there was a sudden change in setting midway through the book and with that change came a new set of characters and plot points. That change felt a little clunky, not fully integrated.

This book is most easily compared to 'The Curse of Chalion' in terms of themes and characters, and I think people who enjoyed that masterpiece will probably enjoy this as well. I think the characters in this book are more compelling compared to those in Chalion, and I think you can make an argument that the prose in 'Transformation' is more beautiful than that in 'Curse.' That said, 'Curse' was a more solid in terms of pacing and plotting and setting.

This is the first book I'm reviewing for the year, and I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorites of the year. This book easily fits in somewhere in my top 20 favorite books of all time. I encourage you to check it out.",1

450,"Female authors in the Australian fantasy market: some recommendationsSo, Maldevinine has written an exceptional essay on the history of women’s speculative fiction authorship in Australia. The link is [here](https://reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/enu2vz/female_authors_in_the_australian_fantasy_market_a/), and I strongly recommend having a flick through before reading this post.
 
With that said, I mentioned in Krista’s thread a while back that I have my list of obscure Australian female authors, and there seemed to be a little interest in that list. So, without further ado:
 
**Trudi Canavan**

Look, I know she’s not “obscure”, but I first came across her hiding at the back of the library shelves, and per the bio she lives in the same suburb that my boyfriend at the time lived in, so I figured she was probably my own little secret. Happy to be wrong on that count! Lives in Melbourne, there’s a link to her AMA in Maldevine’s post.

Her main series is *The Black Magician Trilogy*. Hard magic system, heavily classist society where only rich kids get access to magic. Until the slum girl discovers how to use magic by herself, and she must adapt to being poor and female in a magic school that is exclusively for the rich and mostly dominated by men. And then the neighbouring country invades, etc etc. There’s also a follow up series, set about twenty years after the first, where the main characters in Black Magician Trilogy are minor characters, and their kids have to deal with the fallout of what happened in that. Plus there’s another book set ~300 years before the original trilogy, which is great world building. Absolutely start with the Black Magician trilogy first

* Reasons to like this series: cool magic system. Really well developed, and the use and applications of the magic drive the plot. Good queer representation. There is some light romance, which is really well done and is not the main point of the series. Generally characters are really well developed.

* Things you might not like: it’s a magic school, and some people don’t like that. Personally I thought it served to explain the magic system well, but everyone has their preferences. Slightly questionable age gaps in the relationships. Pretty heavy school bullying in one book – the bullies get their comeuppance, but if it’s something you’re uncomfortable reading, be warned.
Canavan has also written the Age of the Five trilogy, which I have read and enjoyed, but didn’t make a lasting impression on me. Much softer magic system, but good theological fantasy, in the way of Brandon Sanderson’s Warbreaker.


**Kim Wilkins**

Kim Wilkins is another favourite, a Brisbane author who writes in a few genres under different names. I also believe she lurks here, because I recommend one of her books in a thread a while back and got a comment going “oh, that’s me, thanks!”. I haven’t read her entire catalogue, but have very much enjoyed what I have read
What got me hooked was her *Daughters of the Storm* novel. Basic premise is that the king of Thyrsland is dying, it’s a secret, and his five daughters need to fix him. All five of them are very different: the eldest, Bluebell, is a tattooed, scarred, potty-mouthed warrior who isn’t really a people person. And I have to say, a princess with a FWB arrangement is a new one on me. The next daughter is a hopeless romantic, protective mother, and had been married off to form a political alliance. Then there’s the academic priestess-mage, the boy crazy teenager and the religious fanatic.  The five women have to work through their personality clashes to help each other. There’s also a sequel, *Sisters of the Flame*,  which carries on their personal development. Seems like there’s more books coming in the series.

* Reasons to like this book: great demonstration that there’s many different types of strong female characters. As well as good, well written characters that are weak, personality wise. And female friendships. There’s enough worldbuilding and politics to keep me interested, but it’s not over the top

* Things you might not like: at least two of the sisters will drive you up the damn wall. It will be a different two for every reader, which is the fun part. All five of them have very different personality flaws Also series isn’t finished yet, no indication of when the next one is out

With Wilkins writing in several different genres, you get some interesting mixes. Another book of hers that I have read is *Giants of the Frost* – horror fantasy. Urban fantasy, the MC gets a job on a remote island, then discovers it’s actually a bridge to Asgard. And that’s not a good thing. I don’t do horror well, so this was that perfect point of “oh god, I’m so scared I don’t want to finish this”, but also being so hooked I couldn’t put it down.


**Cecelia Dart-Thornton**


Another Victorian author! She studied at the university I went to, and it’s likely that she had an old family friend of mine as one of her lecturers, and that family friend had Tolkein as one of his lecturers. Could be coincidence, but her prose is honestly more Tolkein than Tolkein himself. She has two series, the first being *the Bitterbynde trilogy*, and the second *the Crowthistle Chronicles*

*Bitterbynde trilogy*: basic premise is that this hideously scarred, amnesiac, mute slave thing escapes their bondage and goes to discover who they are, first restoring their physical form, then their memory. And also falling in love, and getting involved in world politics, etc etc. Incredible world building in this one, with eldritch wights, seelie and unseelie courts, all that. She’s done a heap of research and taken in so many folktales from around the world. The other stand-out feature of this is the prose. It’s incredibly lush and detailed – start with Tolkein, then add heavy cream is the best way I can describe it. Here’s a random, spoiler free sample from the first book: “Out of the pale, predawn light emerged the rim of the world, painted with the hasty brushstrokes of clouds. It was suddenly split by the rearing bowsprit before sinking out of sight altogether…Blinking away sleepiness, able aeronaut Ared Sandover felt his innards rise with familiar thrill of falling, as if the deck left him momentarily suspended, and the surging lift that followed when it scooped him up again. The sun’s first rays gilded a vast and endless view of undulating greenery, of tossing treetops”


* Reasons to like this book: world building, prose, good twists and turns. Also lots of made up songs and poems. And anti-gravity metals, and how the society works around that. Disabled characters, sweeping romance


* Things you might not like: the prose might be too much for some. Especially if English isn’t your first language. This is not a book for after three whiskeys.


*Crowthistle Chronicles*: generational saga! Two families: girl with a curse on her family that they all go mad shortly after their first child is born. Boy with invulnerability. At least that’s the first book. Each book follows the next generation, and their travels, and dealing with their family history. This works really well, because each generation leads a very different life to the previous, so you get to explore all parts of the world. Again there’s all the eldritch wights and the worldbuilding, but it’s more about the people than the magical elements. And the prose is a bit less flowery than Bitterbynde.


*Reasons to like this series: generational sagas are cool. Interesting take on mental health. Good plot twists. Great prose without being overwhelming


* Things you might not like: can feel a bit disjointed, moving from one book to another. Romanticises suicide in one of the books.


**Traci Harding**


(Not to be confused with Trudi Canavan). Sydneysider. Possibly the most obscure of the four. Has written five trilogies, the Wikipedia summary is accurate: “Her work blends fantasy, fact, esoteric belief, time travel and quantum physics, into adventurous romps through history, alternative dimensions, universes and states of consciousness.” Honestly, I find that the basic plot through the second and third novels are pretty similar across all the trilogies, but all the first books are great. So, read the first books of all the trilogies, pick your favourite character set, and read the rest of that trilogy is my advice.


My hands-down favourite is *Gene of Isis*, from The Mystique Trilogy. This is a 21st century Australian MC putting together five different diaries around journeys to the same archaeological site in the Middle East, trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while she’s there herself. She also acquires a crusader knight spirit to help her, who was involved in most of the diaries. About half the novel is actually the longest diary, that of a Victorian era mind reader and psychic. There’s a couple of other Victorian ladies involved, and a Cathar priestess.  Our MC is very much a sceptic of psychics and that kind of stuff, so she’s quite relatable in that regard. It’s a really interesting look at unreliable narrators – none of the diary writers knew what was going on either, so you kind of end up getting four stories with their own twists and turns happening simultaneously. Plus a couple of tasteful sex scenes.


The most well-known trilogy is *The Ancient Future*, starting with *The Dark Age*. This is effectively *Outlander* but Welsh. And less rapey and less going round in circles. Basically *Outlander* but without Outlander’s glaring flaws.


The last trilogy I’m going to talk about is *The Timekeepers*, starting with *Dreaming of Zhou Gong*. This is set in imperial China, which is cool and different. The audiobook has a Mandarin-speaking narrator, which is very necessary. While Harding herself isn’t Chinese, she’s obviously done her research. Basic premise is two priestess-sisters are advising and working with a family of warlords to overthrow the evil emperor. Plus shapeshifting tigers.


* Reasons to like Traci Harding: fast paced. Likeable characters. Really good developed male characters – better than most female authors writing books focusing on female characters. If male authors wrote female characters the way Harding writes male characters, we’d be singing their praises from the rooftops.

* Things you might not like: there’s a fair bit of sex. Also, most of these books have the MC being threatened with rape early on – it’s a bit uncomfortable. Never comes to anything, but still. And in general, Harding is something you read for fun – it’s not going to go down in history as the greatest fantasy ever written, but they’re a fun read

The one glaring omission in all this is indigenous authors. That’s on me - I haven’t read many indigenous fantasy authors of any gender. And I’d love to! A quick google search suggests Alexis Wright might be a place to start, but open to recommendations for me! 

Otherwise, let me know if you’ve got any questions or want more details",1
451,"Thoughts on Eddings in 2020What are your thoughts on David Eddings? 

His work was something I adored when I was young but approaching it as an adult I've had some difficulty. In 2020, the Belgariad seems very dated - and is hard to see much more than a collection of tropes, stereotypes (each nation is a completely isolated stereotype of a medieval or ancient culture with a different name), and plot archetypes.

But even so - I still can't but help to love his work. Something about the cynicism and snark in his dialogue, and fantasy played straight is also refreshing.",1

454,"Read What You Already Own 2020: Two mini reviews*Side announcement: My DMs are turned off for a while. If you are trying to privately contact me (I get these sometimes for the database or for requests - these are all still welcome), please contact me on Twitter, email, or ask a mod for help. Sorry for the inconvenience, but you can imagine the trash fire that is my DMs currently.*

I've decided that 2020 will be the year I read the stuff I own. Obviously, I can't read it all this year, and probably won't finish everything. However, I am so overwhelmed by guilt when I look at my Kobo that I had to do something. Now, there's a few rules I've decided for this to work:

* Audiobook monthly credits don't count as ""buying"" - I have an Audible account and I only have a handful of books I've not listened to. So that's clearly not the problem. However, I'm not allowed to buy extra credits this year. (Boo. Hiss.)
* For 2020, I can buy 1 new ebook for every 10 I read that I own. 
* I'll give a book 50 pages. If I don't like it, I can delete and it counts as a read. 
* Print and work-related non-fiction are exempt. Also, I buy almost no print, so it's not really an issue. Work is either writing or for r/Fantasy essays.

Onwards to the reviews!  


I've read two books so far this month: **Burning Bright by Melissa McShane** and **Delia's Shadow by Jaime Lee Moyer**.

**Burning Bright** is a Regency fantasy-of-manners meets Patrick O'Brien. Britain is at war, and needs those with talent to help them win. Elinor lives under the thumb of an oppressive father, determined to marry her off to a man of good breeding. She picks another path, however, and defies her family to join the Royal Navy as an Extraordinary talent. From there, it's life on board a war frigate, with battles and the tight found-family that a ship's life would bring. It has a slow burn, satisfying *mature* romance, but the romance is rather secondary to the plot - even though you know it's absolutely coming. The action is quite well done, and the naval battles themselves are well researched. Highly recommended it as a good gateway to fantasy-of-manners.

**Delia's Shadow** is a history fantasy murder mystery with ghosts. It's a difficult subgenre mash to pull off, honestly, but Moyer does it. Set in 1906 San Francisco, Delia returns home for a friend's wedding. She's haunted by a ghost who was murdered, and Delia is pulled into the investigation of an active serial killer alongside trying to solve the mystery of her own ghostly shadow. Moyer's writing style is lyrical and melancholy, and rather reminded me of Robin Mckinley. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting a bit of historical fantasy in their lives.

What's coming up:

I'm currently 15% into P. N. Elrod's The Adventures of Myhr. So far, I'm getting ""The Redemption of Althalus"" (David Eddings) vibes. So far, this is loads of fun and has a ""wrong place, wrong time"" feel to it. I have no idea where or when I got this book, but I suspect it might have been from a Story Bundle or Humble Bundle.

From there, I have loads of choices. I'll make a comment below with just a few for people to reply to with their comments.",1
455,"Looking for Dark Fantasy with a Sense of Humor for Bingo Personal Recommendation SquareMy last square that I need to fill to complete my bingo board for this year is the personal recommendation square, so I'm turning to you r/Fantasy!

I've realized that some of my favorite series could be considered ""dark fantasy,"" while still managing to keep a sense of humor. Here are a few examples of series that I've tremendously enjoyed, which I think could fall into this category:

\-First Law Series by Joe Abercrombie 

\-Broken Earth Trilogy by N.K. Jemisin

\-The Magicians Trilogy by Lev Grossman 

I also like that these stories include complex, morally gray characters, and I appreciate that all of these authors have really strong voices. Does anyone know of other books that would fit this bill well?

I don't like: most YA, paranormal fantasy, blood magic, grimdark, sex

Some examples of books I've read that are similar to what I'm looking for and have become favourites of mine are: The Night Circus, The Goblin Emperor, The Golem and the Jinni, The Name of the Wind

Books I've enjoyed: Circe, Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City, The Toymakers

Books on my TBR and will probably read this month: The Ten Thousand Doors of January, The Starless Sea, This Is How You Lose The Time War

459,"Spoilers for ""Words of Radiance""--Does a Certain Character Ever Get Better?I'm 40% through the book and I simply cannot stand Shallan. This is the biggest Mary Sue character I have ever encountered and she just gets worse and worse with every chapter. I'm loving the series so far but every time one of her chapters pops up I consider skipping it...bit of an issue for a main character. 

I wrote out a giant rant about all the reasons why I despise this character but I doubt anyone is actually interested. Question stands: does Shallan ever get better?

Update: literally the day after posting this I read a  bunch of chapters focused on Shallan and her backstory and, while I still don't like her, I appreciate her much more. I no longer feel that she's a Mary Sue; looks like I just needed her to have more backstory! I'm leaving this up as a monument to my hubris.",1

I tried to read it but couldnt go further than like five chapters because of how much I hated it.

The MC is meant to be a baddas assassin while still being a ""girl"", but she feels like the concept of a girl for a 9 year old who watched only romances.

The girl can barely poop properly and her physical body is in the worst possible shape but she immediately experiences ""teenage like attraction"" towards the guy who wants to use her for a collisean fight. And she looks at herself with a dress and goes all like ""THAT'S SO CUTE"".

Description:

Following a terrible war that buried their empires in fire, survivors fled to a new home across the terrifying sea. Drawn to the great abandoned Obsidian City, ringed in strange black walls with a dark tower reaching high into the heavens, they find haven. Adrian Korien, born to this new world and to a people who distrust old nobility and gods, spends his days dreaming of adventures.While learning the family way from his father, Adrian also trains in the local guild. Lead by Eyldr, the long-lived inhabitants of this new world, Adrian is taught why the north men fear the southern lands. Curses and poisoned land, men driven mad, and beasts growing grotesque beyond the forests and mountains fill their legends.When monsters destroy his way of life, Adrian becomes drawn into the maddening games of a mysterious noble in the Obsidian Tower. Haunted by voices in his head, a power out of his control, and with visions of a life not his own, he must venture from his home and into a world awash with blood, banished gods, noble intrigue, and vicious creatures",1

467,"What's a good Fantasy book (or series) that isn't too dark, but still a fun read with some emotional beats?I'll be honest; I don't think I've actually read a book in... *oh god*, like *five years*. I've been craving a chance to just kick back and relax, and *really* get into a book.

As a teenager, I *loved* the Drizzt Do'Urden/Forgotten Realms books. Probably my favorite book was Elantris by Brandon Sanderson (I also read his Mistborn trilogy, but found it a bit of a bummer).

It probably sounds dumb, but I *really* want to dive into a Fantasy book (or series) that keeps things a little more upbeat. Not childish, but just, I want to feel *good* after reading. That's why I could never stomach Game of Thrones, and probably why I've loved the tv show, ""Jane the Virgin"" (it's absurd, but just super fun and feel-good to watch).

It's about a family in Chile and paints a picture of what Chile was like during the second half of the 20th century including the coup of Pinochet and his dictatorship. 

Magical realism isn't fantasy in the sword and sorcery sense. These types of books take place in our world, but supernatural or magical elements will occur throughout these types of books.

473,"Series with an incredibly powerful and influential protagonistHey Fantasy enthusiasts,

I know one of these threads comes around every now and then, but bear with me. I have depleted my entire reading list with overpowered main characters. And I'm really into this type of fantasy genre.

In particular, I'm looking for series in the style of King's Dark Tidings (with Rezkin), Trysmoon Saga (with Gen) and The Wheel of Time from the point where Rand really comes into his power (I'm talking Jesus Rand).

In other words, I like series with main characters who are so powerful and so influential that they turn the entire world in which the story is based, on its head. 

This quote from WoT conveys what I'm looking for in a main character very well: ""*He came like the wind, like the wind touched everything, and like the wind was gone*.""

Thing is though, such a character is pretty difficult to pull off succesfully and build a believable story around. But when it works, it's just sooo satisfying! 

The character doesn't have to be a Mary/Gary Sue (e.g. I don't consider Rand to be such, since he had a lot of forces and people going against him - seeing as the odds were so high - and he was pretty much universally disliked as a person).

The main character can be female or male. I haven't actually read a whole lot of series with female characters that answer this criterion - maybe The Book of the Ancestor Series, although Nona isn't anywhere near 'overpowered' although she does exert great influence in the end. Katsa in Graceling may also fit. Another one may be Kate Daniels, but she too didn't become so incredibly powerful compared to some other characters in the series. The Symphony of Ages on the other hand was incredibly dull imo. It felt like all the downsides of a Mary Sue, without any of the benefits.

Malazan and WoT being two exceptions, I also like a series to be more centered on one character.

Other series I've read and enjoyed:

\- Night Angel Trilogy

\- Demon Accords Series (although I thought it became really convoluted and contrived by book 7)

\- Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear

\- Malazan

\- The Nightside (he isn't really op though, but through is infamy he is very influential)

\- Red Rising trilogy (Darrow is another good example of what I'm looking for - on both fronts)

\- Mistborn trilogy (up until a certain degree)

\- Prince of Thorns (influential, definitely)

\- Riyria Revelations (maybe this isn't the best example of what I'm looking for, but they were very fun books!)

\- I'm going to start reading Stormlight Archives when there's a couple more books in the series

Things I don't really enjoy:

\- Xianxia fantasy

\- Progression fantasy (such as Cradle by Will Wight)

They follow a girl in a London-esque setting although I don't think it's London necessarily. She has dark hair. She MAY be an orphan or just come from a poor family.

There were updates up until  26 July 2017 about the movie and they had concept artwork and news articles about it. Then nothing? It disappeared and there was no information about what had happened.

483,"Reading The Witcher novels is really hurting my appreciation for the show.I, like quite a few people, probably jumped pretty hard on the Witcher bandwagon when it came out. I pretty much dropped Wheel Of Time halfway to get started with all the Witcher short stories. I just have to say, the amount of detail I find left out is amazing. 

It honestly blew my mind when I saw the audiobook rendition of the Striga short story being an hour long. Like, you could literally just adapt that line for line and still have room for all the other stuff that happened in the episode and you'd be fine. Instead, it seems they just made weird changes for the sake of them (can't exactly get into them, because spoilers).

I won't even get to the adaptation they did for the Golden Dragon arc. That thing is 3 hours long in the audiobook, and it's given maybe 40 minutes in the show. Needless to say, it was terribly butchered. Oh and some of the changes to Yennefer and her reactions to destiny are...distasteful and childish in the show. 

Still, everything considered, the show was good, and Henry Cavill is a God. I just wish they actually stuck harder to the source material because it's amazing.

488,"Five short reviewsI've noticed more posts with collected short reviews and thought I'd give it a try; one reason I don't post reviews more is an unhelpful anxiety-adjacent feeling that I should write a dissertation or nothing at all. So let's see how it goes.

1. ***Ship of Smoke and Steel*** **by Django Wexler.** A solid if somewhat typical YA fantasy adventure (in that Potter Stewart ""I know it when I see it"" definition of YA). Isoka is a mid-level gang enforcer who can access magical powers through one of several ""Wells,"" in her case the Well of Combat. A government agent blackmails her into a mission to hijack a legendary ghost ship. I thought this book was fine--I know ""it was fine"" is almost a pejorative these days, but this book definitely fell into a ""not great, not awful"" range for me. It had a proactive protagonist, some nicely-drafted fight scenes, and a decent beginning of a F/F romance (though I admit I'd like to see less ""gosh, maybe I'm gay?"" and more ""I'm bi, boom, there you go"" in stories now). The ending was a bit anti-climatic to me. I think that if you like YA fantasy, especially well-written but formulaic YA fantasy, this would be a good read for you; personally, while I appreciated what it did it didn't especially excite me and I doubt I'll read the sequels.
2. ***A Cavern of Black Ice*** **by J. V. Jones.** The first book in the epic *Sword of Shadows* series. I DNF'd this one but wanted to put it out there because I thought it was pretty good, just not what I was looking to read right now. It's a multi-volume, multi-POV epic fantasy series with politics and war, set in a grim Northern European-esque world. I thought the prose was solid, the main characters very interesting, and I enjoyed the hints of dark magic, but I got about two hundred pages in and knew that I didn't want to force myself to read it and risk resenting it. I don't see it mentioned often here, but if you are looking for some epic GOT-esque fantasy, this would work for you. (NB: There is at least one on-screen rape, so if you are looking for 0% sexual assault you'll want to avoid this one.)
3. ***Altered Carbon***, **season one (Netflix)**. Cyberpunk action/mystery series based on the book of the same name by Richard Morgan. Takeshi Kovacs is a kind of renegade super soldier who is reincarnated into a new body by a wealthy magnate in order to solve his--the magnate's--death. I really enjoyed this show--I thought it was stylish and atmospheric and did lots of things right that I felt *The Witcher* whiffed on: it had a gruff, aggressive protagonist who was actually a main character and had agency in his own story, it had well-acted side characters (none of whom you want to smack in the head with a brick), it looked modern and sophisticated, it had believable relationships and at least plausible sexual relationships (and more equal-opportunity nudity). I appreciated the pacing, though I admit the show does occasionally become exposition-heavy. I'm looking forward to season two.
4. ***The Divinity Student*** **by Michael Cisco.** I read this novella a week ago, when the two threads about ""realism"" in fantasy were going full-swing here. I read a chapter or two, then I'd read someone's comment of ""fantasy HAS to be based in REALITY"" or ""an author can't just DO what they WANT"" and I'd laugh and laugh. *The Divinity Student* is a weird, weird, dream-like story that begins with a man being struck by lightning, dying, then being taken by nameless whoevers who bring him back to life by removing his internal organs and viscera and stuffing him full of paper documents. That's the first two pages. The man then leaves the seminary he's studying at on a mysterious mission to become a professional word-finder in the surreal desert city of San Veneficio. I enjoyed the hell out of this book, even when I had no idea what was going on. It really is like a dream, with scenes and imagery flowing, with that particular sense of dream logic that makes sense when you're sleeping but when you wake up you ask yourself, *where did THAT come from?* and you have to approach it that way. It's beautiful and unnerving and I'm eager to read more of Cisco's work in the future.
5. ***Borne*** **by Jeff VanderMeer**. Scavenging the landscape of a nameless, ruined city, Rachel finds a cute little organic blob. Though it has no apparent utility in surviving her harsh world of gigantic flying bears, poisoned lakes with discarded biological experiments, and roving feral mutant children, she brings it home and names it ""Borne."" As Borne begins to grow and learn, Rachel herself starts to learn more about herself and how the city became the way it is. *Borne* is very much in VanderMeer's wheelhouse--weird ecologies, mutations gone wrong or just inexplicable, identity and body horror--but for some reason I found it kind of mundane. Which is weird to say about a book with a kaiju-sized flying bear and a shape-shifting land anemone and ethereal foxes and memory beetles and shit. I loved VanderMeer's *Southern Reach* trilogy and his Ambergris stories, but *Borne* never quite enticed me like they did--it's not quite as baroque and whimsical as Ambergris, it's not quite as disturbing and mysterious as *Southern Reach*. It feels sort of like VanderMeer Lite, it has all the same sort of themes and variations on images that he's known for but kind of samey, without the spark. Maybe it's *too* VanderMeer; if you've read any of his other stuff, the reveals aren't going to feel all that wondrous. I did like the early interactions with growing Borne and Rachel. I like VanderMeer's other books a lot but I doubt I'll reread this one.

Thanks for reading. Currently working on: some short stories by Kameron Hurley, finishing up *The Book of the New Sun*, and midway through some vintage High Fantasy from Phyllis Eisenstein.",1

Huge successes like Worm or The Wandering Inn have certainly not gone unnoticed by speculative fiction fans and most of us have heard whispers about that legendary site: *Wattpad*.

People might avoid them because the quality of the novels wildly vary and it takes too long to sift through so many options until you find something decent.

This is my attempt to broaden the audience a little bit, while giving other speculative fiction fans the chance to find amazing stories and fellow authors another outlet for their creations.)

Let's get into it:

**The cons of webnovels**

* Quality does vary greatly and you'll have to sift through tags and read synopsis, reviews and first chapters looking for something you like and that *is* a bit timeconsuming. I still think it's not much different from looking for books you might enjoy, if you search efficiently. 
* Novels tend to be dropped. A lot. The golden rule that everyone tends to follow is: if it's less than 20\~30 chapters or 200 pages, don't touch it. Filter out everything that is on hiatus. Big yes to novels that have at least one arc / volume / book finished.

**The pros of webnovels**

* They're almost all completely free. Authors will have patreons, paypal and ko-fi if you want to tip them or get extra rewards, but that's it. If you don't like something, you've wasted nothing but a bit of time.
* Fast releases. To make their novels competitive, authors tend to release new chapters at the very least weekly, with the most common release schedule being 2\~3 times a week. Some even release *daily*. Some, still, release several chapters a day. You can follow the novel, forget about it during the week or for a month and end up with quite a stash of chapters to binge. 
* Being part of something that is being created ""in real time"". Webnovel authors will often ask for input from their readers, have fun polls where they ask them to vote on certain things, active discord servers, etc. You can also come up with and discuss theories and character growth as the story advances. It's a livelier community than getting a book that's finished and then you just talk about a full, finished project.

**Where to look for webnovels?**

With webfiction guide not accepting new members, it becomes a bit harder to find an impartial list of quality webnovels. You can still look at their [top webfiction guide](http://topwebfiction.com/), but you're likely to have heard about some, if not all of the authors there. So, what to do when you've read through this list already (or browsed through it and nothing caught your attention)?

[Muse's Success](https://muses-success.info/) \- This is a ""sister site"" to webfiction guide that serves as a directory. Webnovels have to be added manually either by fans or the authors and there is a rating system, but I can't vouch for how reliable it is.

If you want to forego directories and go right to the source, however, I'd say [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/home) is the biggest site for speculative webfiction. Yes, Wattpad exists, but it's largely for romance (some with speculative elements, of course), but it's also a bit of a mess to navigate and it's very unkind to new authors and works more like a SNS than an actual writing site. RoyalRoad offers better options in terms of following webnovels, looking through and filtering tags, getting rid of fictions you don't want to see, etc. It's a very good platform, overall, the best of its kind, I would say. It does lack a mobile app, but that's being worked on at the moment.

**The Tops and Lists**

Of course, the first place most people will look at is the tops and most viewed lists on any site. Don't be surprised if you find yourself disappointed with some of these. It happens. Make sure you don't stick to the first page only.

[Best Rated](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated) \- As the name indicates, this is a list of the best rated novels in the entire website. Some of them are already finished and have been so for years, some are still ongoing and have been so for years. You can select the complete only and active only best rated depending on whether you're looking for completed or on-going novels, too.

[Trending](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/trending) \- This is a list of 50 fictions that are doing the best at the moment, on the site. They call them the ""rising stars"" because they tend to be newer fictions, but you might find some older ones there as well.

[Popular This Week](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/weekly-popular) \- Again, as the name suggests, the novels that have been most viewed and rated the past week.

These lists tend to be somewhat repetitive. If you're on the top 7 on trending, you get a lot of exposure and that makes you rise on Popular This Week and Best Rated. It's kind of a cycle. So, what to do if you're done reading everything that interested you on these?

**Search Feature**

Maybe you're out of more popular stuff to read and want to dive deeper. Maybe you like finding hidden gems. Maybe you want to scratch an itch for a very specific genre. Don't fear, the search feature is here. And I'm too. I'm going to link you directly to the speculative genre tag searches. All you have to do is further filter the searches for anything else specific you might want or not want, choose whether you want on-going or complete fictions, pick which content warnings you're fine with. Filter as little or as much as you like! Though I'd say to filter a little bit if you want something specific, don't filter too much or you might end up missing on awesome novels just because the author forgot to tick a box or decided to put in a gore warning for that one scene where someone gets an arm cut out.

[Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=fantasy&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original) \- [Historical Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=fantasy&amp;tagsAdd=historical&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original) \- [Horror Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=fantasy&amp;tagsAdd=horror&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original) \- [Horror](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=horror&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original) \- [Sci-Fi](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=sci_fi&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original) \- [Horror Sci Fi](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=horror&amp;tagsAdd=sci_fi&amp;maxPages=20000&amp;type=original)

**Final Notes**

* Don't filter for completed if you want finished books but are fine with ongoing series. Authors will usually make a listing for a series but *not* mark it as completed until the entire thing is done.
* Some webnovel authors will self-publish. If you become their patron early on, you'll be getting cool stuff, helping them on their journey and getting a free book at the end. You might even get a character named after you!
* Rate, review, all that, but please be kind. A lot of webnovel authors are very young and / or just starting out. If you see a story that you absolutely despise and / or can't read, it's best to move on and click the ""don't show me this novel again"" button than to rate them a 0.5\* and ruin their day. Did you enjoy a story, however? *Splurge*. Make an account (or log in with google) and slap on that 5\* advance review on it.
* You're gonna see a lot of, hmm, *particular* tropes. Don't give up. Please. For the sake of all of us that don't write them and need more readers. ~~I'm begging you.~~

To paraphrase something another user said on the RR discord: ""You tend to find good writing and the same boring old ideas in mainstream fiction, while webfiction is filled with original ideas and worldbuilding but the writing is sometimes not the best"". I think that sums it up pretty well. If you're looking for innovative ideas while seeing and helping writers grow at the same time, give webnovels a try.

496,"Review: Eaglebreaker (Tale of Eaglefriend #2) by C.L. Murray - Out tomorrow!Right out of the gate, I have to point out how awesome it is to see a pregnant commander! It's absurd how underrepresented pregnancy is in SFF outside of reproductive dystopia, I can only think of a couple other works that feature it. Here we actually truly see a successful woman, dealing with the internal decisions of when and whom to disclose her status to, how it will affect her career and the accommodations that can be made. /rave

Sydrenna, an eagle trainer for her clan, has lofty goals of innovating a new deadly eagle formation and gaining power, but in doing so takes a dark path into ruthlessly enslaving and crushing the spirits of those she can capture. Morlen the Eaglefriend must set off on a journey to save the Eagles and the spirit of his friend Rofthome. Meanwhile, Valeine and Verald are set to ride out to war, as the wildlands are ever encroaching, overrun with the minions of the Ferotaur King. So divided, they must together save their land from evil.  

With the first book we had a very traditional fantasy plot setup, here there are some elements (an almost frodo/gollum journey relationship plays out), but the plot really ramps up from an idyllic start for the new couple, to the much darker happenings in the background of the world that will alter their course. Eaglebreaker explores much more of the heavy weight of decisions on each characters shoulder, for the greater good or those they love.

*I received early release of this book for beta reading purposes, with no personal affiliation to the author or review commitments attached, this review reflects my own honest opinions.*

498,"Violya (In the Heart of the Mountain #2) by Rosalyn Kelly Book Reviewhttp://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1744-violya

4.5/5

VIOLYA by Rosalyn Kelly is the second volume of IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAINS, which is a feminist dark fantasy series that deals with a multitude of societies undergoing deep social changes. I really enjoyed the previous volume, MELOKAI, and eagerly picked up this book the moment that it came out.

The book opens up with a helpful recap of the previous one's story hooks and plots, which I believe more books should include. The previous Melokai is dead along with her child, the rebellion by the peons has been crushed, and the people of Peqkyrian are stuck between the twin dooms of death or losing their traditionalist Amazon-esque culture. Worse, they are surrounded by enemy civilizations that wish to destroy them for their alien ways as well as resources. The Peqkyrian are not perfect victims with a history of conquest, slavery, and oppression among them.

Much of the book's first half deals with following up the events of the previous one's climax. The Peqkyrian have been hit hard and are struggling to deal with the blow to their cultural pride every bit as much as the damage done by the invaders. Though they technically won, they had their leader killed and their great library burned to the ground. Rayma's death causes most of the people to mourn her, even though she was a hated tyrant just a few days prior.

Violya is the new Melokai and stuck with the unenviable task of trying to reform a society that murders most of its useless men, keeps slaves, and is corrupt with cronyism at every level. She has the power of the Sight and has won a great series of victories but this does not guarantee her status. Violya wishes to reform Peqkyrian society, if for no other reason than their rampant slavery and misandry deprives them of valuable military resources. Unfortunately, reform is not always welcome and has the potential to backfire as we see with other rulers.

I was particularly fond of the character Jessima. Married off to a religious fanatic who she is not overly fond of, she's carrying the baby of his brother and set to become queen of Lian. Unfortunately, it is a society with no respect for women and she is expected to be nothing more than a pampered concubine when the entirety of the royal dynasty comes apart around her.

The politics of this world are brutal, the action is fierce, and the world-building is top notch. I think if you're looking for a new grimdark series then this is probably your best bet. It has a female perspective that is sometimes overlooked in the genre but benefits works like A Song of Ice and Fire as well as The Witcher. Sometimes the characters are a little too unsympathetic but everyone's of enjoyment for antiheroes varies.

I was also fond of the characters Ammad and Toby as the two of them show very different perspectives on the non-Peqkyrian storylines going on. Ammand is a brutish murderous scumbag who is like Khal Drogo and Joffrey had a baby. He has nothing going for him but his ability to kill and royal pedigree. So, when he loses both of his arms, he has nothing to fall back on. Toby is a captured prince who is tortured by the depraved ancient enemies of his family who have no interest in leaving him intact for ransom. His horror story is similar to the adversity many women suffer in grimdark fiction and seeing it gender reversed was, if not refreshing, an interesting twist.

In conclusion, definitely check this out if you have the time. In the Heart of the Mountains is shaping up to be solid works of fantasy and original to boot. I really enjoyed this book. I should warn readers that there is a lot of dark subject matter within. At least one character suffers sexual assault, there is torture, and it is a dark violent world that absolutely deserves the title of grimdark. It is also a strongly feminist work that I think brings a new view to the genre.",1
499,"Magic for Liars: an attempted reviewI say attempted because oh boy there is a lot going on

&gt; ""It's not that I didn't have a choice. I did. I had a thousand choices. I was so close to making the right one."" 

A teacher turns up dead in the library of the Osthorne Academy for Young Mages, and private investigator Ivy Gamble, who is definitely not magic, is called in to crack the case. Complicating matters is a member of the teaching staff, her estranged sister. The magic twin, the *successful* twin, the twin Ivy pretends she doesn't wish she was. And as we're told from the beginning via the above quote, this doesn't go exactly according to plan.

Osthorne is very much a modern high school, with graffiti on the walls and lockers, and teenagers struggling to figure it all out, in both mundane ways - there are bullies to avoid, pregnancy scares, secret romances, that teacher that everyone knows is inappropriate but never seems to face any consequences, and tests to cheat on - and magical, as Gailey joyously teases us with a familial prophecy that announces that here and now, the Chosen One will come from their ranks. Into this mix they throw Ivy, to play with tropes herself, deliberately playing to or against the expectations of students who are familiar with detective fiction, of course they are, as 21st century kids. 

Yet while Ivy wants to solve the case, what she needs is to belong. And so she chooses. Chooses to lie, and pretend she does belong here, in this school for the her she can never be. Chooses to pour her efforts into resurrecting the relationship with her sister. Chooses to believe it's all going to work out, they'll be friends, just like before. This relationship between the twin sisters forms the heart of the novel, as we slowly spool out the reasons for their estrangement, and learn more about each of them. And all the time, that warning from the beginning of the book hovers above it all, letting you hope, for Ivy's sake, that you're wrong, but still waiting for the other shoe to drop, for this to all come crashing down around her.

**spoilers below**

&gt;!And fall apart that dream does. The lies she tells to Rahul fall through as expected, and his reaction is reasonable yet brutal. But it's the tension between her and Tabitha, the job and her personal strife, the past and the present, that gives the finale to the novel. The final choice she makes, to betray the job for her sister, is both ethically yikes, and entirely understandable. And in the moment, it barely feels like a choice, allowing Ivy to lie to herself once last time before the reckoning we've seen already, to pretend she didn't have a choice. This was all she could do. Except she did have a choice, and she chose wrong!&lt;

Magic for Liars was a delight, a masterful spinning of a thousand different plates that rarely even looks like dropping any of them. The acutely human characters are matched as equals by the relatively sparse prose and, if you're an audiobook listener, Xe Sands manages to elevate this even further with her excellent narration - I wholeheartedly recommend it.

501,"[Grimdark Magazine] The Witcher show to bookshttps://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/netflixs-the-witcher-the-books-vs-the-show/

Like many individuals, I was introduced to The Witcher by the CD Projekt Red video games that showed a dark, sensual, cynical, and sometimes humorous world I hadn’t yet encountered in fantasy. Before Joe Abercrombie or even George R.R. Martin, Andrzej Sapkowski created a multi-book epic that incorporated elements from Polish folklore, Spaghetti Westerns, and his own life experiences that was already a nationally popular series in his homeland before it exploded onto the world stage with his adaptations. While CD Projekt Red and Sapkowski have since reconciled after a nasty legal dispute over royalties, the Netflix series is an adaptation of his novels rather than the games that take place a few years after said events.

Sitting down to watch The Witcher on Netflix, I was curious how they would adapt the stories as The Witcher is unlike most fantasy series. It begins with two collections of short stories that were initially published in fantasy magazines. These short stories are far from inconsequential and if you were to begin with The Blood of Elves (the first “proper” Witcher novel) then you would probably be at a loss. Instead, it is much better to read both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny if you want to understand what’s going on in the series.

Thankfully, the first season of the Netflix show is a decent adaptation of both The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. There are many omissions, additions, changes as well as a somewhat questionable timeline but it manages to capture the spirit of the novels. It also conveys most of the pertinent information that sets up The Blood of Elves as a story. I’ll talk about each individual episode as well as their changes below to give a sense of what was kept as well as what was discarded.

Warning: There will be spoilers for both the book as well as show.

**Episode 1: The End’s Beginning**

The End’s Beginning is a loose adaptation of The Lesser Evil which is not the first Witcher short story (called The Witcher) but one of the better Sapkowski tales that is also, I kid you not, a grimdark parody of Red Riding Hood. Geralt finds a bandit woman named Renfri who is on a mission of revenge against a mad wizard named Stregobor. Geralt establishes his life philosophy of refusing to engage in the lesser evil because, at the end of the day, that’s still evil. The event haunts him in the books but the show portrays the measures he must take to save lives from both individuals as a much greater character development moment than in the books. Renfri’s memory will haunt Geralt for decades to come as he is forced to kill her in a brutal sword fight that helps dub him, “The Butcher of Blaiviken.”

**Episode 2: Four Marks**

Four Marks is the largest deviation from the book as it is a primarily Yennefer of Vengerburg-adapted story. She meets Istredd, her other lover here in a wholly invented story. While she was described as a former hunchbunk in the story, fixed by magic, this is a minor plot detail that is meant to help explain her prickly demeanor. The mages are also more ruthless with young women turned into eels who don’t make the grade. The book also adapts The Edge of the World which is done accurately and depicts the harsh state of the world for elves. We see the sacking of Cintra during this story and Queen Calanthe’s suicide as well, forcing Ciri on the run to find Geralt.

**Episode 3: Betrayer Moon**

Betrayer Moon is an episode that continues Yennefer’s story arc and the idea that she chose to become beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Yennefer of Vengerburg is described as a deformed girl who had her body straightened by the sorcerers and then is sterialized as Tissaia wanted no distractions from her work. Her deformity in the show is portrayed as something abnormal rather than a common affliction among young witches as in the books. Also, sterilization is something that is a consequence of having her deformity surgically removed not something Tissaia did to all young women. The Witcher short story is adapted here with an accurate retelling with the addition of Triss Merrigold.

**Episode 4: Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials**

Of Banquets, Bastards, and Burials creates another Yennefer story where she serves as the King of Aedirn’s royal advisor for decades, only to be witness to him having his wife as well as baby daughter murdered. The rest of the story adapts A Question of Price which is also accurate to the books but has a lot more violence as well as special effects. The episode also has Ciri head to Brokilon Forest where she initially did it in the books before the sacking of Cintra as well as meeting Geralt there, which she doesn’t in the show. The show also claims Calanthe took part in the Great Cleansing and pogroms of the elves, which did not happen in the books.

**Episode 5: Bottled Appetites**

Bottled Appetites is a loose adaptation of The Last Wish. The depiction in the show is very accurate with Jaskier (Dandelion in the games) getting Geralt in a conflict with a djinn as well as Yennefer. A wholly invented plot occurs with Cahir, a future ally of Geralts, murdering Mousesack the Wizard (whose fate is uncertain in the books) to replace with a doppelganger. This wholly changes the storyline of “The Sword of Destiny” as well as makes the Dryads almost incidental.

**Episode 6: Rare Species**

Rare Species is an adaptation of The Bounds of Reason which is a dragon hunting episode that deconstructs a lot of traditional fantasy narratives. Geralt and Yennefer’s relationship is changed due to their tempestuous long-time arrangement being compressed in the show. Ciri and Dahir’s encounter with the Doppelganger is wholly invented with it being filler to give her something to do until she reunites with Geralt.

**Episode 7: Before A Fall**

Before a Fall is a compressed adaptation of Something More. The story is much less humorous with much of the back and forth between Geralt as well as Calanthe being played seriously versus for laughs. We also see the Brotherhood of Sorcerers decide to side against Nilfgaard when none of this was ever depicted in the show. Yennefer also tries to talk some young girls out of being witches, despite them not having any magic. Fringilla, who is a moderate Nilfgaardian patriot in the books, is reimagined as a murderous fanatic. Cahir continues to have adaptational villainy, murdering several innocents to find a doppelganger.

**Episode 8: Much More**

Much More ends the season with an adaptation of Something More. It is completely different from the short story since the short story is Geralt recovering from an injury while hearing about the Battle of Sodden Hill nearby. The battle is dramatized as an epic brutal conflict between Nilfgaard’s and the North’s wizards.

There are other changes throughout the show, especially visually. Geralt of Rivia only wears one of his swords, the steel one, and keeps his silver sword on his horse Roach’s pack. The cultural and ethnic makeup of the cast is also a bit more diverse, but this is not necessarily untrue of the books. The humans of the Continent come from both the world itself as well as through a portal to our universe via the Conjunction of the Spheres.

The big changes between the books and show is a matter of presentation as the series shows numerous events out of order, deletes some important ones, and increases the role of both Yennefer as well as Ciri before they enter Geralt’s life. This can be confusing to fans of the books and might be to viewers as the original books were quite well-paced in building to The Blood of Elves. I also regret the loss of characters like Essi Davin.

Still, I think Netflix avoided the mistakes of most adaptations by trying to change the “meat” of the story. The Witcher on Netflix is a dark and brooding series that is sure to delight fans of the books.",1

504,"On diversity and translated books (Also general rec thread)This sub talks a lot about diversity, but I find the talks to be ironically not so diverse (non-maliciously so). If we're going by privilege and hardship of access, then I think having English as your native language is by far the biggest privilege a writer can have, and culture can and likely does influence your writing more than most other aspects do. From my admittedly distracted POV, the discourse on this sub seems to come from native Anglophone people endlessly talking about diversity only in scope of the English-speaking world.

Most Anglophone readers seem to ~~abhor~~ overlook translations, while people from some non-Anglophone countries often have the opposite, equally damaging view that ""books from other countries are better because they were deemed good enough to be translated"". Even I find myself unconsciously thinking this, and I'm a translator and bilingual writer with a gigantic brain, a beautiful body and an impeccable sense of humbleness.

Fyi, I do agree with the idea that - whether we want to or not - we're all affected by the suckiness of certain power structures, be it race or gender or language or breakfast cereal (cheerios are bullshit). Cultural paradigms are hard to break, often done so by the overwhelming power of furious Twitter posting. But unless you're purposefully avoiding people of certain race or gender, like I avoid being friends with men with undercuts, then it doesn't say anything about you. You're probably a decent person with a respectfully limited criminal record, and if you're getting along with your parents you've likely called them in the last two weeks.

That said, if you're truly interested in diversity (again, nothing wrong if you're not actively so) then you should read more translated stuff. As should I, which I would also like to ask the more internationally minded redditors here for some recs.

Not sff, but I'm currently reading Olga Tokarczuk and she's dope.

505,"preaching and ideological villains are very overratedit seems that anytime someone talks about what makes a good villain, people always come to the conclusion that you gotta give them a  seemingly noble goal or have them make a good point to the mc. am i the only one who thinks that this is overrated as hell? 

personally i have no problem with villains who are just evil and selfish and dont have tact on ideology to seemingly make them well rounded. as long they have the main thing that is CHARISMA and a PERSONALITY. that is the most important thing. even if a villain has an ideology they can lack in charisma which makes for a really shitty villain. the villain just makes a robot that spews ideology and not an actual human. pretty much every villain in my hero academia is like this.

the main problem with these ideological villains is that most of the time they're ideology breaks down after 2 seconds of examination. now one might argue thats why they are the villain. but usually the villain is smart enough to realize that themselves. THANOS is a perfect example of this. altho thanos has an interesting personality to make up for it so hes still a pretty decent villain.",1

https://preview.redd.it/d1wqywri35a41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3cc2aad9772994904d8d78a5877d7d5653daa1

I've read volumes 1-4, but this review is spoiler free. 

The first thing I need to say about [Monstress](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29396738-monstress-vol-1?from_search=true&amp;qid=Vz3xF1O5ty&amp;rank=1) is that it’s gorgeous. The art style is so detailed and beautiful. Delicate patterns, steampunk art deco aesthetic, creepy old gods, cats, everything I love. It’s also dark and often bloody, no sunshine and flowers over here. In fact I saw someone say it was grimdark, and that explains a lot. Would I have read it had I known? Probably, because of the cats.      

Another thing I absolutely loved was the worldbuilding. For one thing there are talking many-tailed nekomancer cats (and poets, but I’m less impressed with those). Cats are one of the main species on this world, super cute but also vicious and conniving. This paragraph alone would’ve been enough to sell me on this book, but even beyond the cats the world is great. It feels large and real, with different countries, that hold deep grudges and complicated political relationships. The world is recovering from a war, ended by a nuclear like calamity that no one can really explain, but everyone is after the weapon that caused it. The Arcanics  are a species, kind of creature, category of people that are a mix between human and ancients. Ancients are powerful magical creatures, like bipedal animals, for instance a woman shape and sized many tailed fox. 

The story is about Maika Halfwolf, trying to survive and figure out her past while navigating all the many groups that want to catch her and use her for her own interests. Things rarelygo well for her, and knowing friends from enemies is next to impossible in this cat eat cat world (note: the cats don’t actually eat cats). Everyone is morally gray, with most people towards the darker shades, there’s a lot of exploring who the monsters are , is it worse if you kill to protect or do nothing to defend etc. Is Maika a monster, was she made that way, can there be redemption? Everyone has a secret, an ulterior motive, hiding information for their own reasons, trust no one heavily applies, but sometimes the only way forward is too trust, 

Trying to figure out her past through fragments of memory and talking to people also reveals a lot of the world, especially the ancient history of the mysterious old gods, which I found interesting, and I’m glad to see the story seems to be showing more and more about them as it evolves. 

I liked how, for a horribly depressing world filled with war crimes and slavery, the parts inhabited by Arcanics, at least, are inclusive, I really liked the married sea queens and the two tiger-god-fathers. 

With all the nations and their plots and their secrets and mysteries, I had to do a recap of volume 1 (which I’d read a few months ago) before starting the others, so I’d advise doing them in one go if you also sometimes struggle with keeping things straight.

508,Did I miss the Harry Potter boat?I'm in my late 20's and so many of my friends my age loved the Harry Potter series as kids and to this day. I'd liken to be able to share in this fandom with my friends. I never got into the series back then and wonder if it would be worth reading as an adult.,1

512,"B-tier mediocre/good fantasy books to recommend?\-A very unusual question, I know. I wanna start reading books again like my childhood days and I've always liked fantasy books. The thing is, as a beginner, I won't be picky about any book I read or criticize it; I'm gonna enjoy it anyway.

\-What I mean by B-Tier is a good fantasy book. Just good/fine. Also, I've seen this video where the YouTuber put the Harry Potter series in the B-Tier section. He called them good, but overhyped as there are many titles that are better. Is that true?

514,"First fantasy audiobook for not a native English speakerHi, I've decided to switch from listening to music on my runs to give a try to an audiobook.  I've never before listen to an audiobook in English (and only once in Polish - so I'm newbie),  so this would be my first. I think that I'm not that bad with that language, so I want to give it a go. What would you recommend for a first try? I care for really good experience, I mean the narration must be really good. I don't want average one. But the book should not be hard fantasy with some hard to understand magic system or something. For example, I've read The Way of Kings 3 times, but I think this would be a hard pice of cake to listen in English, because the magic system sometimes was hard to understand even in my native language. So I would like to have a good story, with very good narration, but not so complicated when it comes to description of magic and etc.",1

517,"Feminist Grimdark: Some recommendations by mehttps://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2020/01/feminist-grimdark-recommendations.html

One of the things I love is grimdark fantasy. I write for Grimdark Magazine, I love numerous grimdark series, and I occasionally dip my toe in the genre even if I'm probably way too light-hearted a soul to really touch base with it despite my many grimdark protagonists. One of the things I recently had a conversation regarding, though, was about feminist grimdark.

For the sake of avoiding miscommunication, what do I define as feminist grimdark? Both feminist and grimdark? Feminist fiction for me being fiction that that deals with the problems and perspectives of women through the lens of oppression or acknowledgement of their struggles. It covers everything from Handmaid's Tale just to Buffy's kickass adventures. Grimdark, for the purposes of this article, is a description of dark and gritty adult science fiction or fantasy. It's not meant as a pejorative but as a way of saying, ""This stuff gets dark, yo. Keep the kiddies away.""

I thought I would share some recommendations for books both by women and about female adventures with a particularly dark as well as twisted bent. I welcome anyone who wants to contribute their own recommendations to the story and why. 

For the sake of avoiding miscommunication, I'm going with the criteria.

* It's by a woman.
* It's about at least one female main character.
* At least one of their struggles in particular is related to womanhood.
* It's grim and dark
* It must be science fiction, fantasy, or urban fantasy. It can edge on horror but must include one of those other three.
I'm going to try to also draw some attention to some lesser known works as well because, why not? 

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **The Court of Broken Knives** by Anna Smith Spark.
For me, the most fascinating story about this grimdark book would have to be the tale of Thalia the High Priestess. A woman who has spent her life committing abominable sacrifices in the name of a (probably) nonexistent god wants to live a normal life for herself. Well, normal is a complete failure when she hooks up with the psychotic yet charismatic warlord Marith. Anna Smith Spark has rightfully earned her mantle as Lady Grimdark with this dark and twisted tale.
2. **Darkstorm** by M.L. Spencer.
The Rhenwars Saga is actually based around the characters of Darren and Quin but my favorite of her creations is undoubtedly Merris in the first book. A young street urchin who is adopted as a sorceress, she's a character who goes in entirely new directions than is normally expected from such a formula. The women of the Rhenwars Saga are expected to be the support and love interests of the men but oftentimes find themselves out of such roles, pursuing agendas that would never be accepted under rules of ""traditional"" fantasy.
3. **Melokai** by Rosalyn Kelly.
When I first was coming up with this article, I was actually just going to talk about her because her books are a fascinating glimpse into some genuinely twisted grimdark that has a definite feminist bend. The Peqkyrian people are a brutal imperialist slaver culture. They're also a race of matriarchal women warriors. The corruption of their ruler, the Melokai, makes up the first book and is a fascinating glimpse into someone who is as flawed as well as outright corrupt as anything you'd find in George R.R. Martin. The Peqkyrian are the protagonists but not necessarily the heroes and how they impact other women in other nations makes some fascinating twists as well as turns.
4. **A Wizard's Forge** by A.M. Justice.
The story of Vic is an interesting tale of a typical fantasy heroine's desire to go out ""there"" and learn more only for it to go horribly wrong when she's kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave to a man interested in breaking her mentally. She escapes, becomes a warrior, learns magic, and then struggles to continue deal with the gaslighting that continues to effect her decades later. I really liked this book for its continuing ability to zig whenever I expected it to zag. Others struggle with the fact the heroine isn't automatically going to make the right decision.
5. **The Blood of Whisperers** by Devin Madson.
Really, I love all of Devin Madson's work and there's nothing I wouldn't recommend by her. A friend of mine says that I should be recommending We Ride the STorm but I just happen to like this installment by her slightly more. Princess Hana was a character that spoke to me and I liked her more, what can I say. The fact it's not automatically set in a Medieval Fantasy world was a good benefit to it as well.
6. **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang.
I would be extremely remiss if I didn't put this one on the list as it's rightfully earned its place as one of the stand-out books of the genre. Taking the Young Adult formula of other books and putting it through the ringer, it uses a fantasy version of the Second Sino-Japanese War (a.k.a WW2 for many of us laymen) to show the sheer stark brutality of it as well as how it can corrupt even the kindset souls. This is probably my no. 1# ""you must read this."" 
7. **Godblind** by Anna Stephens.
Godblind is the hard-hitting debut by Anna Stephens and the first volume in the Godblind Trilogy. The novel is a medieval epic fantasy set in the small land-locked kingdom of Rilpor and its antagonistic western neighbours, the Mireces. The geography is small, but the cast is large, with ten point-of-view characters. All are variously traumatized, and none escape with clean hands. The rigorous pace and savage fight scenes make it compelling reading. Women play a fantastic role in boith the religion as well as the narrative with it being among my all-time favorite grimdark stories.
8. **The Dragon's Legacy** by Deborah Anne Wolf.
The world is dying and everyone in a nomadic desert people and its neighboring China-like empire knows it. However, the two races are meeting the conflict differently with questions of heritage, lore, and family playing a central role in the story. It may not be the darkest fantasy to get the grimdark label but I learned about it through Grimdark Readers and Writers so I'm going to count it anyway. I absolutely love these books.
9. **Guilty Pleasures** by Laurel K. Hamilton.
Given the predominance of urban fantasy and paranormal stories by women, this is a strange one to pick out of all of them to put up here but I think it deserves that spot. Before Laurel K. Hamilton's signature series went, uh, into a different genre she created it with the idea of making a feminist heroine who was as prone to drinking, violence, sex, and brutality as any male noir hero. She also added vampires. I remember picking this up due to its descriptor as an ""R-rated Buffy"" and I still have an affection for the first ten or so books about a Necromancer vampire executioner.
10. **Sunglasses after Dark** by Nancy A. Collins. This is another cheat but it's my love of morally ambiguous anti-heroines and Worlds of Darkness that brought me into grimdark. Really, I could go all day with my recommendations but I'll choose this one here. Sonja Blue is just a character I love and as a amoral vampire is one of my favorite.",1
518,Fantasy by Indigenous AuthorsHello! I am looking for recommendations for books written by Indian/indigenous/first nations authors. In 2020 I am working on diversifying the folks I read and I have not found many recs for fantasy by indigenous authors. Thank you for anything you can recommend!,1
519,Trying to get into horror novels. Can anyone give some recommendationsCan anyone recommend some horror novels? I want to expand out of fantasy and scifi and want to try some horror. I really like occult/supernatural type stuff. Big fan of Victorian like Penny Dreadful as well so things in that realm would be great. Also as a disclaimer I don't know if I like Steven King. I think I have read like 80 pages of The Stand like 15 years ago.,1
520,"The Semi-Annual Recommendation Thankyou ThreadSo every six months l do a quick recommendation thank you thread - in part because i always wonder if people actually looked into what i recommended. But then I can never remember who specifically recommended things to me so why should anyone else ... so instead i start this generic thread once in a while. i just do this general post and invite others to chime in with reccs they were thankful for.

So my favourites among the variety of books i picked up over the past six months because of recommendations in r/fantasy include but are not limited to:

- Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik
- The Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames
- The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison
- Storm Front by Jim Butcher

... and not a favourite ... but the most recent was the very old fashioned hack and slash novel Sworddancer by Jennifer Robeson ... a throwback to simpler times.

Thanks everyone for the variety of interesting reads you continue to recommend.",1
521,"Why do so many fantasy series seem to slow down halfway through?I've always had this problem that whenever I pick up a series of books, specially with epic fantasy, the ones in the middle are the hardest for me to get through. Most obvious example for me is A Song of Ice and Fire, I basically devoured everything up until A Feast for Crows, which I found to be a slightly slower read but still very enjoyable. Then A Dance with Dragons came out and I jumped into that book so excited to reconnect with the characters that had been left out of book 4, but... I don't know, it literally took me months to get through that book, and I even had to restart a couple of times. And don't get me wrong, ASOIAF is still my favourite epic fantasy series and I think ADWD was a great book, but it just doesn't seem to have the same great pacing that hooked me when I read A Game of Thrones. Another example that comes to mind is Oathbringer. I'm not a crazy Sanderson fan and there are many things I don't like about his style, but I do admit he is one of my primary choices for comfort reading, when I'm just looking to have a fun time. Like the Star Wars of literature, for the sake of comparison. Yet Oathbringer was the first Sanderson novel where I was honestly bored, specially after the previous instalment, Words of Radiance, boasted such a huge climax that just didn't seem to pay off as I expected. Reading through Reddit I have seen that many people have a similar problem with this book and while fans swear that it gets better, I honestly don't know when I will have the will to pick it back up again.

I can give you more examples but I think I've made my point, and both of those series are popular enough that I believe most of you will have read at least one of the two. I also believe Harry Potter had this same problem with The Order of the Phoenix, another read that took me far longer to get through than any of the previous books. Overall, what I believe is that writers tend to have a problem picking the pace back up after getting through the first big story arc of a long series. That first arc tends to be very satisfying, introducing the characters, setting up the conflict and orchestrating a big climax that offers a taste of the battles that are yet to come. Yet when all the noise has died down and the characters need to continue their journeys, authors seem to struggle to pick the pace back up. I understand that modern readers can be very impatient, and that a pause is necessary to explore where the characters are at after the consequences of the previous climax and how those events have affected and changed the world around them, but often it feels that authors dwell for far too long in this phase, or they don't manage to make it feel as... poignant as it should.  For me, this is a moment that should have that ""calm before the storm"" feel. Like, at this point in the story we are usually coming from the first great battle (or battles), where the central conflict of the story has escalated into a full on confrontation between the different sides involved, and that confrontation has had definite consequences on the disposition of the game board. Alliances may have been made or broken, some characters will have grown more powerful, others will have suffered a defeat or maybe even death. For the protagonists it may have been a victory, or it may have been a defeat. Maybe they have come ever so close to achieving what they sought after but then failed to grasp it, or maybe it was much farther away that they initially thought. Who knows, perhaps they have actually achieved their goals but then realised that it wasn't what they truly wanted.

You know what story did this brilliantly in my opinion? Avatar: the last Airbender, with the character of Zuko. (Incoming spoilers, BTW).

So the second season starts right in this spot I'm talking about, and it does so with a victory and a defeat for each of its to protagonists: on one hand, Aang and his friends have managed to protect the Northern Water Tribe from the Fire Nation; on the other hand, Zuko has failed to capture Aang, yet again, and has decided to abandon his country, drifting into a crisis that makes him question his entire identity. What the show did right was not getting stalled in this point but rather pushing Zuko to progress through the plot WHILE at the same time developing his character. He doesn't just stand still in the same place waiting for his personality to grow, he keeps travelling, he faces new challenges and new enemies, he keeps advancing, and through those experiences he lives is how he gets his character development.

I guess that's my problem, actually. There is this idea that plot development and character development can't coexist, and it just isn't true. You don't need to stop the story in its tracks just to leave room for the characters to grow. Sure, for the plot to advance in a coherent and cohesive manner characters need to evolve to the point where they can make the decisions the story needs to move forward. Zuko has already had the seeds of doubted planted into him, but his journey is necessary for those seed to grow roots and become a stalking, inescapable thought in his mind. Only then will his future decisions make sense, and without those decisions the story could never move in the right direction. But that doesn't mean the plot stops just to wait for him to have his emotional growth, it keeps moving, stuff keeps happening to him that doesn't let him stay still. And, therefore, the plot doesn't stay still either. Because there's no point in trying to create a ""calm before the storm"" feeling if the storm never comes at all!

Gosh, how I love Avatar.

Anyway, that's my whole take on this topic. What do you think? Is it also a problem for you, or do you believe I'm exaggerating?",1
522,"I read 150 books this year. Here are short reviews of 55 of my favorites.

523,"Review: The Raven and the Reindeer by T. KingfisherFor the holidays, I received The Raven and the Reindeer by T. Kingfisher. It was given to me by a family member who had gotten it based on my goodreads list, although I couldn't, for the life of me, remember hearing about it before. But, I took a quick look at the plot and it was based on Hans Christian Andersen's Snow Queen (which I vaguely remembered...), which intrigued me. So I dived in! 
  
I really enjoyed it--The Raven and the Reindeer is a retelling of the Snow Queen. It's about a young girl, Gerta, who sets off to go rescue her friend that has been taken by the Snow Queen. T. Kingfisher (which is the pen name of Ursula Vernon) dives into the world of the early nineteenth century Scandinavia for a fun fantasy and adventure story. 
  
I think my favorite parts were with Gerta's friends--I don't want to spoil too much of it, but she gathers some unusual friends and like most stories, the journey is the best part of the story. Especially with respect to the adventure portion. It was just a pure fun story of exploration, something that I read a lot when I was younger but hadn't in a while. I enjoyed the humor, both the parts that made me laugh out loud as well as the more subtle bits.  T. Kingfisher/Ursula Vernon is a great writer and I loved her writing style--she threaded the line between building enough world details to allow me to imagine it, but not so much as to be a domineering presence. 
  
I think that fans of Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik or the Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden will enjoy this. This is a shorter story (especially compared to the trilogy), but it's got that same great fusion of historical and fantasy elements. 
  
As a side note, after I finished, I was curious about the original fairy tale and looked it up, expecting that some of the more fantastical elements were put there by T. Kingfisher. NOPE. Fairytales are weird.",1

525,"Lots of Audiobooks in 2019NOTE:  TLDR at the bottom...

I used to read a lot of fantasy when I was a kid.  But, I kinda got away from that until I fell hard for the Dresden Files back in 2002 or 2003.   I've read them all up to &amp; including Skin Game, which came out in 2014.   But, I kind of drifted away from reading books after that.

Starting back in the summer or fall of 2018, we were finally seeing some signs that JB was close to finishing the next book, Peace Talks.  All the signs about Peace Talks got me itching for more Dresden, so I looked at my library of Dresden Files books.  Since I had collected the books over about a 15 year period, I had a real rag tag collection.  I had some on MP3 Audio CD, some in regular CD format, some in paperback, some on Audible, some in Hardback, some in Kindle and a few in Kindle/Hardback and few on Audible/Hardback.

So, since it was around the time of my birthday, I splurged and filled up my digital Kindle and Audible libraries with the complete Dresden collection and commenced a Dresden Files binge-a-thon.  I started in June of 2018. I finished all 15 books + 2 anthologies in  2 1/2 or 3 months.  I was at a bit of a loss when I finished that and I went a day or two wondering what to listen to next and I decided I wanted to do it again.  I went around for a 2nd binge listen, which took a little longer. Then, I did it again a 3rd time (yeah, it was overkill).

My mom died about the time I finished my 3rd binge listen in January of 2019.  I was heart broken, of course.   I needed  something to take my mind off things.  Something totally escapist.  I had kinda OD'd on Dresden, so, that's when I started trying to find something new that I hadn't listened to before. And, I did listen to a bunch of different fantasy books that were new to me, mostly UF.  Underwhelmed by some, fell in love with some and hated some others, 

So, 2019 was the year I fell in love with fantasy again.

Here's what I listened to or read in 2019:

* Finished up 3rd binge-listen of the **Dresden Files** by Jim Butcher in early Feb.:  OMG, I love that series and James Marsters ***IS*** Harry Dresden, but I had kinda OD'd on it.
* Read (didn't listen to) 2 **Mercy Thompson / Alpha Omega** books because I got them cheap on Kindle:  I burned through those pretty quickly, but was underwhelmed and felt no desire to continue
* Saw that they made **Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline into a movie, so I listened to that audiobook by Wil Wheaton: it was so good.  Really checked off a lot of boxes for me, great story, good MC, great narration and, although it's more SciFi, it did have a lot of fantasy elements in it because of the huge VR universe called OASIS. Bonus for me: tons of 80s pop culture references: I am a child of the 60s who went to HS &amp; college in the 80s, so it was awesome.  Saw the movie a few months later: the book is SOOO much better, glad I listened to it before seeing the movie.
* **Fated (Alex Verus #1) by Benedict Jacka**, read by Gildart Jackson. Loved Alex as a character, but was a bit bothered by Alex's condescending attitude towards Luna in Book #1, didn't pick up #2, **Cursed**, until later in the year
* **Monster Hunter International** by Larry Correia, read by Oliver Wyman.  I loved those books. They are over the top and absurdly pro-gun at times, but so much fun! Total escapism overload! I love Oliver Wyman's voice: Owen Pitt is a great character. I binge-listened to the first 6 books + 1 short story anthology in about 2 months.
* **Rivers of London** by Ben Aaronovitch, got a deal on that on Kindle, so didn't listen to it, I read it. Too slow paced for me, but thought I might give #2 a try later on.
* Decided to take a chance on **Alex Verus** again and I listened to Book #2, **Cursed**: I'm so glad I did!  I totally fell in love with Alex Verus.  The relationship with Luna was so much better in Cursed and it was a great, fast-paced story.
* Binge-listened to the rest of the Alex Verus books:  I was able to burn through books #2-#9 in about 2 or 3 weeks.   The series just got better &amp; better as it went along.  Real cliff-hanger ending of #9 got me excited to listen to #10.
* Binge-listened to Alex Verus again, more slowly the second time, which takes me up to August
* In August, I got Book #7 of the Monster Hunter series, MH: Guardian. it's not read by Oliver Wyman, sadly: different first person POV character.  Not thrilled with the beginning so I set it aside for a while
* Caught Brian Naslund's AMA at the beginning of August, I was intrigued by what he told us about his debut novel, **Blood of an Exile**. So, I listened to that: I loved the MC, Silas Bershad, the Dragonslayer.  The audiobook narration was awesome (Steven Brand narrated, IIRC). I will listen to it again before the next book comes out.  Gotta get my dragon fix!
* Went back to **MH: Guardian**. After the weak start, the book got to be pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the female narrator for this book (can't remember her name), but I loved Mr. Trashbags. I loved that he got a bigger role in the story. The book was good, not as good as some of the other ones.  The epilogue was awesome and saved the entire book for me. I will listen to the next MHI book that comes out (hopefully from Owen Pitt's POV &amp; read by Oliver Wyman).
* Had a hankering for some more dragons after **Blood of an Exile** (I blame u/Brian_Naslund for this), so I listened to the first few books in the Temeraire series by Naomi Novik, read by Simon Vance.  I am a HUGE fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian (read by Patrick Tull) and this series is basically Master &amp; Commander but with dragons. I thought it was awesome.  Simon Vance is now one of my favorite narrators.
* Tried reading Rivers of London #2, but I didn't care for it. DNF
* Got a free audible code for **Pemberley: Mr. Darcy's Dragon**, by Maria Grace, read by Benjamin Fife.  I kinda liked it, but not enough for me to want to read or listen to the second book.
* In September, **Fallen** by Benedict Jacka was released (**Alex Verus #10**).  So, I listened to a bunch of Alex Verus books again just before it came out. Then, listened to Fallen 2 or 3x: it's by far the best book in the series so far. I LOVED it!
* Finished the last few **Temeraire** books by Naomi Novik, read by Simon Vance.  I wish she had written some more of those: I thought they were great.  I loved the relationship between Temeraire and his rider, Capt. Laurence**.**
* **Obsidian's Son** by Shayne Silvers (Nate Temple #1), read by I can't remember who.  Absolutely hated that narrator. He was horrible.  Plus, Nate Temple was a total Mary Sue with unexplained and unearned powerups that seemed to have been jammed in for the expedience of the plot.  Despite many recommendations I've seen for that series, I had no desire to listen to Book #2 after such a dreadful start (I understand that they are re-releasing the first few audiobooks with a different narrator, which has to be an improvement!).
* **Assassin's Apprentice** by Robin Hobb, read by Paul Boehmer.  I loved Paul Boehmer's voice. Fitz is a great character. I'll probably listen to the rest in 2020.
* During his AMA in August or Sept., I asked **Brent Weeks** about which of his series he would recommend to a new reader and he answered that if I were into fast-paced books, he'd recommend the **Night Angel Trilogy**.   So, I started with those.  I LOVED those books. Paul Boehmer's voice is awesome (and very different than in the Robin Hobb book, which he read with an English accent).    I loved Kylar, Durzo and Logan.  I think I will listen to Brent Weeks' other series this year.

What will I listen to in 2020?

Definitely Alex Verus #11, Forged (possibly with another binge-listen before it comes out). Another binge-listen to the Dresden Files before the July 14, 2020 release of Peace Talks. I think the sequel to Brian Naslund's book will also be out in 2020, I'd love to listen to more of Silas Bershad's story!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR??**   Binge-listened to Harry Dresden WAY too much in 2018, then I had a rough start to 2019 &amp; needed some escapism. Got hooked on listening to a bunch of fantasy books.  Next to Harry Dresden, Alex Verus is my new love.  But, I also discovered that I have room in my heart for Owen Pitt, Temeraire, Kylar, Durzo, Logan, Fitz and Silas Bershad.  I'm looking forward to finding some more new to me books to love in 2020.  Maybe Brent Weeks' other series read by Simon Vance will be the next one, I think but a binge listen to Harry Dresden is on the horizon.  I gotta get ready for Peace Talks!",1

527,"You HAVE to listen to: Bluefax's Hobbit AudiobookI will admit, first and foremost, I thought I hated JRR Tolkien's work. I thought I just didn't like how longwinded and boring it could be, that after my first experience, going for any more would be an excersise in misery.

My first mistake, of course, was not reading, but watching, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.

In listening to the fantastic work of Bluefax, I found myself ever easily sucked into the world of Middle Earth, the first fantasy experience for some, a cornerstone of the genre, I finaly was able to experience in a way that helped me engross myself in the world and hook myself on every word. To go on about the masterful crafting of the story, filled with adventure and fun, would be to attempt to sell water to an ocean, as we already know Tolkien is, considered by some, a pretty good author.

So, let me explain to you why you should listen to THIS rendition of The Hobbit. 

This audiobook is a soundscape, full of music that will draw your nostalgia ever forward as each new plot point hits and adventure overcome. You will find yourself ultimately one with the world of Middle Earth, from the stormy mountains to the twilight forests. And the narrator himself, Bluefax, drifts into your ears bringing the wonder of Middle Earth out into breathy and comforting tones. Though yes, his voice seems unfit for certain tense or adrenaline filled moments, he's able to pull most all else off without nary a nitpick.

And that is not to move past his narration, and into the characters. Each voice is expertly distinct, and the methods of voice acting here make it feel as though a cast would have been hired, though I won't accuse Bluefax of misleading, his range is ultimately suspicious in the best way. Smaug, Gandalf, Gollum, the Dwarves a many, the elves, and yes, Bilbo himself, are done to perfection, and not only are the voices distinct they bring about perfect emotion and the lines are read so well I nearly cried when we finally reached the end... and don't keep me going, I haven't even told you about the SONGS, by GOD he has the voice of an angel, and... elves and... dwarves and... it just sounds amazing, ok! 

If you haven't experienced The Hobbit yet, or want to find a new way to experience it once more, I must recommend the person which finally pushed me into the world of Tolkien.

528,"Recommendations for fantasy that takes place in rural America?I have an oddly specific request, but it's really hard to find that type of fantasy books I've been looking for. I want magical books that take place in a rural, nature-y American setting. I want the rocky shores of Maine and the starry, desert nights of Utah, and the thick, forests of Virginia instead of in a city or a secondary world.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want:

* magic
* in nature-y/ rural setting
   * towns and civilization is okay. Skyscrapers and taxis are not.
* in America
   * Absolutely no secondary worlds. Made-up town is okay. Made-up country is not.
   * Must clearly be set in the US, not a ""Gotchu! It seems medieval, but it's actually the US 1000 years from now!""
* I'd prefer modern times over historical, but won't be too picky
* I'm open to Adult or Young Adult

&amp;#x200B;

What I **don't** want:

* No horror or dystopia (No Stephen King or Joe Hill or Margaret Atwood) 
   * Scary is okay. Primarily shelved in the horror section is not. 
* None of the typical urban fantasy tropes:
   * no werewolves/shifters or vampires or angels
   * no paranormal romance (aka main plot is about the romance w/ magic on the side)
   * no plot lines that are just basically murder mysteries, but with magic thrown in. No detectives or PI's.
   * No Kelley Armstrong, Jim Butcher, or Anne Bishop type of books (no shade, I like them. But I'm really not looking for that urban fantasy feel, even if the book happens to be in the country.)
* No magic portal books that spend most of the book basically in a secondary setting (ie Narnia, Harry Potter)
* No Orson Scott Card

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of books I've read that at least somewhat fit this criteria (please assume if I mention an author here, I'm familiar with their work and don't need more recommendations from them!):

&amp;#x200B;

* American Gods by Neil Gaiman
* River of Teeth by Sarah Gailey
* The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater
* Thirteenth Child by Patricia Wrede
* Middlegame by Seanan McGuire
* Some of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness
* Much of Charles de Lint

529,"Looking for a book about an outcastWhen I was young, one of the first books we had to read in English class was a book about a young, bitter girl who went to live on a farm house, and eventually opened up and was accepted. I don't remember its name, but I remember it fondly because I could kind of see myself in that angsty girl. Fast forward a billion years, I'm now a bitter, jaded man, looked down on by most due to being unattractive and outcast from society at large because of my introverted nature and my beliefs.

Without going too much more into detail, I'm looking for a bit of escapism. I'm looking for a book about an ""outcast""; someone who doesn't fit in, someone who is maligned by society for whatever reason. A book about someone who manages to defy the odds and somehow find friendship and love. I know this sounds very Fairy Tale-like, but I happen to prefer darker/more adult themes, so I'm open to all suggestions.

530,"Review: Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly tl;dr:  I loved the characters and mood in *Dragonsbane* but found the writing style annoying.

John is a local lord in a small, isolated, poor northern holding.  Jenny, his lover, is a witch/healer/midwife. One day a young noble  arrives, seeking John’s help. John, you see, once killed a dragon, and  is therefore the only Dragonsbane alive. Now people need his help killing another one. He only managed to kill the first one  with the help of Jenny’s poisons and magic, so she goes with him. And  of course the situation turns out to be much more complicated than they  expect: the dragon is there for a reason, and that reason might be more of a danger than the dragon itself.

Things I really liked about this book:

* The unheroic hero. Jenny is middle-aged, not pretty, not even described as looking “strong” or “fierce” or “having character”. Or even witchy.  Just small and plain. She is disappointed in the weakness of her magic,  and frustrated about always having to choose (and not being able to choose  once and for all) between spending her time on increasing her magic, or  on her lover and children. She doesn’t regret any of her choices, because she couldn’t have done anything differently, but still wishes  that things were different. She loves John and her children, but also  resents them for taking up so much of her time and keeping her from  growing her powers, and feels guilty about her inability to choose. “She  should have loved, she thought, either more or less than she had.” All of this is taken seriously and not turned into a funny quirk. She is annoyed and tired in realistic way, rather than entertainingly, wittily grumpy like frustrated people often tend to be in books. 
* The unheroic sidekick. John is a Dragonsbane, but neither looks nor acts  like the hero that folks expect. He dresses in brown  plaids (because his home town is both poor and cold and muddy), and he wears  spectacles. He’d rather read a book about history than go out hunting  dragons. And if he has to kill one, he won’t do it the glorious, honorable way, but would rather sneak up on it after it’s been weakened  by Jenny’s poisons. 
* Their mature relationship. No dewy-eyed romance, no “will they, won’t they”. A solid, long relationship between mature adults. 
* The unheroic mood. This whole book feels like November. It’s muddy and  gray and cold and windy. Of course dragons don’t wait for the best  adventuring season. 

Things I really disliked about this book:

* The ornate similes. Barbara Hambly really, really likes describing  colour and light, in as fancy terms as possible. Dew drops don’t just  twinkle – “brightness spangles the wet grass like pennies thrown by a  careless hand”. Rain pouring from a gutter is “like a string of diamonds  in the moonlight”. The metal of John’s jerkin “gleamed like a maker’s  mark stamped in gold upon a bolt of velvet”. Descriptions like that are  empty posing, IMO: they sound impressive but they do nothing to help me  picture the thing or place described.  
Is the sparkling of the light truly the most essential part of this  scene? I wish she spent more time telling me what the city looked like,  or the path to the mountains. Several times we are told that the gnomes  have light eyes, and their hair is white and wispy like cobweb – but  what does the rest of the gnome look like? More about the shape of  things, less about the light, please! Jenny is no court poet, she’s a  down-to-earth witch!
* More mildly I disliked the one-dimensional secondary characters,  especially the evil sorceress who turned into more and more of a  caricature as the story progressed.

I would love to read more about Jenny but the flowery language really got on my nerves so I don't think I will.",1
531,"Review: Watchmen by Alan MooreThe first time I read *Watchmen*, I was fourteen. The last time I read it, I was nineteen. Now I'm twenty-six, and, having just reread what has been one of the most important books in my life, I really just want to talk about it. 

When I was fourteen, what I appreciated about this book is how cool it is. If what you're looking for is an exciting story set in a fascinating universe and populated by badass characters, well, *Watchmen* might be for you. It has it all: good fight scenes, charismatic villains who kind of have a point, and some of the greatest one-liners ever written. If you've read it, you know which ones I'm talking about. If you haven't, I won't spoil them. There's a guy with god-like powers and a guy who's basically Batman, if Batman had realistic mental health issues. There's nifty technology and excellent non-linear storytelling and the kind of clever writing that makes you swear out loud when you finally catch on. For all that it is a grim deconstruction of the superhero genre, it is also fundamentally a great superhero story. (Do note the ""grim"" part though--this isn't a happy book.)

When I was nineteen, I loved its moral complexity. It asks great questions (and god help me, I was sure I had answers to every single one). How do we deal with the problem of human suffering? Is evil a result of personal moral failure or larger structural problems? How can it be combated, if it can be combated at all, without ultimately adding to it? Does human life have an intrinsic value? Can violence serve a moral purpose? Do we have free will? The book provides intelligent arguments from multiple viewpoints, and refuses to provide any easy answers. 

Today, it's hard to put my finger on just what continues to draw me in. To be sure, it's still an excellent book. Every single panel works very hard, conveying layers of meaning both individually and as part of a larger gestalt. It's full of beautiful juxtapositions, double meanings, and intricately interlocking stories. The characters are incredibly complex, in ways that I wasn't able to comprehend when I was a teenager. On those merits alone, I can recommend it wholeheartedly. Evangelically, even.

And yet what I think makes this book important to me now is how familiar its world is. The people of that Earth live under the threat of nuclear holocaust. They retreat to disparate ideological corners and prophesy over headlines, trying to divine what will happen in an increasingly uncertain global landscape. They are hurtling towards destruction, aware of the absurdity of their situation, with no apparent way to stop it. Seeing that experience, which is familiar to many of us, reflected in such a cogent and humane manner was a powerful experience, and a strangely comforting one.

As I hope you can tell, I sincerely love this book and have for a long time. I'd love to hear what you guys think about it.

First I want to say how fine crafted and well written this series has been so far. Really enjoying all the Edmonds fielders but ever since book one when nynave shows up it feels like an annoying mom is tagging along on our epic adventure. All she does is throw shade on moraine and maybe I missed something but the whole ""In love with LAN"" thing feels like it came out of no where.

I really like egwene and am looking forward to her training in tar valon (or wherever her character goes) but having nynaeve with her feels unneeded and repetitive 

I apologize if by book 5 or something she's badass and one of the most beloved characters of the series  I'm very new to this series

Is this a common opinion about nynaeve early on?

Also would say Mat is my favorite character so far",1

I want to savor that read.

That being said, I've got a few fun ones on my TBR that I've heard a lot of great things about. I will eventually get to all of them, but I'm having trouble deciding which one would be best following Words of Radiance and before Lies of Locke Lamora and Oathbringer. 

As you all know, there's no better place to turn to for these kind of questions than this beautiful sub.

Rage of Dragons, Sword of Kaigen, Senlin Ascends, The Last Sun,  The Bone Ships or God of Gnomes?

Which of these would you read between a first read-through of Words of Radiance and a first read-through of Lies of Locke Lamora?

It's probably more likely that you've read Senlin Ascends or Rage of Dragons since they seem to be the most popular in readership/ratings on Goodreads and whatnot, but I don't want to just go off popularity alone.

Bonus points goes to anyone out there who has read all of these already. Bravo!

I managed to track down a bit more information for you folks. Here we go:

* She is closely related to the concept of truth. her main power is Speaking the Truth, and when looking at her in a different way, it was described as ""You're looking at the truth""

* Her end goal is a utopia through control. Everyone is happy, but she rules over them.
 
* The exact words used to describe her when she was manifesting her powers were ""Overbearing, Threatening, and Protective""

* Her story/mythology is heavily centered around happiness and hatred, and likely has to deal with these themes.
* She used a door made out of chalk with arrows pointing to the handle that led to a completely grey room with computers in the corner. Her power in this room was seemingly limitless. The gm *really* stressed this point too, and it was a very big deal that I was there and able to escape. The more time I spent in the room, the weaker I got.

It is also definitely **not** Athena. Even though she checked all the boxes, were looking at something else. Probably **not** Greek or Roman.

**TBR'd so far:** 
  
* **Republic Commando** series by Karen Traviss  
* **Resistance Reborn** by Rebecca Roanhorse  
* **From a Certain Point of View** anthology, edited by Elizabeth Schaefer. Whoever recommended it first had me at ""Jawas"" then I heard something about a trash compactor monster and well, I was sold.  
* **Leia: Princess of Alderaan** by Claudia Gray
* a number of fanfics on the ""deflecting stormtrooper"" theme and something about an Imperial project manager 
* **Bonds of Brass** by Emily Skrutskie, ARC. Sure, it's not _officially_ Star Wars...but just read the blurb. 

**Preferences:**
  
* My main requirement is **well written characters** - my favourites out of what I watched were The Mandalorian and The Last Jedi. Otherwise, generally competent writing. Must be fun. No sexist bullshit. While I want popcorn, I want good popcorn. And really, I'm going to put some loose requirements regarding the concepts I'd like to see below, but if the characters are good enough...   
* I really liked the ""anyone can be a hero, regardless of background"" thing TLJ had going on.  
* **Tie-ins:** Old and new are both fine! I don't care about canon. Especially interested in Mandalorian culture, or anything that humanizes the faceless side characters like clone troopers and stormtroopers. New characters. Fun concept is a plus. Other stuff - convince me.   
 * Note: Yes, heard of Thrawn. Not really interested.  
* **Fanfic:** More than welcome! DM if you must. Interests same as tie-ins, or focus on (original?) characters in a minor/""unimportant"" role (see ""project manager"" above), or anything post-TLJ that gives the sequels a better ending than RoS was (STILL BITTER), or that has LGBTQ+ stuff (ALSO STILL BITTER), etc. Preferably little to no sex. Preferably close-ish to canon. No AU, no crossovers. I've never before felt the need to go for fanfic like I do now and also I'm super vanilla, okay? 😂  
* As for **non-Star Wars sci-fi/science fantasy** that attempts to scratch the same itch or is basically Star Wars with serial numbers filed off, sure, why not (see: Bonds of Brass above). Relatively light stuff please. I'm really not up to anything too heavy or literary atm.

I'm a big fan of the video games and recently watched and loved the TV show. However, I've found the first two books of short stories kind of dull. They seem to be mainly dealing with a frankly frustrating Yennefer love plot or witcher jobs where Geralt seems to almost be a passive secondary character while other people discuss whats been happening in the world.

I guess my question is if I get through these two books does an overarching plot come together that will give me something to immerse myself in?",1

541,"Grim Dark Recommendation After Finishing Red Seas Under Red SkiesHi everyone,

I was hoping for some recommendation after just finishing Lynch's RSURS. I loved LoLL and thought RSURS was a solid B+. Heard bad things about RoT but will probably get to it soon (maybe next?) but I might want a Lynch break. As for my taste and what I read: read everything by Abrecrombie and absolutely loved it. By far my favorite author. Read everything by GRRM as well and also love it. Unfortunately I am also a bit of a picky reader. I've started a few other series I have not gotten through and am wondering if I should go back or start something new:

&amp;#x200B;

Started and almost finished: Scull's The Grim Company. Read the first two books. I think they are OK but they feel like a bit of a cop-out of Joe and GRRM without adding much. The story reads a bit too much like a DnD campaign where the characters randomly encounter conflicts that are irrelevant to main story. Is it worth finishing the last book? 

Started: Gardens of the Moon by Erikson. This actually seemed up my alley. I liked the writing style but about 1/4 of the way in I didn't have a damn clue what was going on. I'm an audio book listener primarily while I do medial tasks, commute, or workout so I'm not always 100% listening (probably 95% but haven't had issues with other series doing this, I just don't have much 'real' free time). It also seems like a big dive with 11 books and all. Is it normal not to know whats happening at this point? Can I get through the series in one piece given my 'reading' style?

Started: The Name of the Wind by Rothfuss. Got about 1/4-1/3 of the way but honestly was not very engaged. Should I go back? I was planning on just holding off until he finishes the 3rd book probably.  


Broken Empire seems up my alley but I'm a bit worried about first-person rapist accounts. I think I can get over it though and probably enjoy the series. Just wondering if I should go back to what I already started or start something new. Read the first two chapter of Prince of Nothing by Bakker and I'm not a fan of the writing style at all so that one seems out. Given what I've liked and what I haven't, what do you guys think is the next best step?",1
542,"Looking for a book I read about 10 years ago.I was talking to a friend about weird books and this crawled out from the depths my memory from when I was 11. 

All I remember about the book is that it was about a pack of sentient wolves and one of them had a great magical power to rival the bad guy and she was the chosen one, standard YA fantasy tropes. Also almost all, if not then the entire pack of characters that you follow through the book die by the end.

Please help me find this book because I can't remember it for the life of me.",1
543,"Reading Diversely: No, we're not saying you're a Bad Person™For as long as I've been here, I've been seeing the discussion. The call for more diverse reads. I've participated in them. I've argued with people. I've seen the dumpster fires burn. And now, with /u/KristaDBall's newest thread, the discussion is arisen anew. This sub heavily favors recommending men over women and genderqueer folks. I'm sure the numbers for ethnicity would be equally skewed. These facts are followed by one of the most hated suggestions:

# Read more diversely.

And invariably, folks prickle at that. They get defensive or outright hostile. They lash out. They dismiss and demean. They send Krista, in particular, a message calling her a cunt. They proudly proclaim they only read *good books*. That they *don't care about gender*. For years this has been happening. For almost as long, I've been chewing on the concept of this thread. Because I was noticing that pattern and I wanted to figure out the right way to talk about it and help. I never sat down to do it though, in hopes of writing a brilliant essay and refining it for y'all. But here I am finally and I'm just winging it.

So I will start as the title of the thread starts: no one is calling you a bad person. That's never been the point. Those of us who have attempted to shift things, to encourage diverse reading, to discuss our biases, have never wanted to sit in judgment of anyone. We just want to see the scope of what's read expanded. And I'm putting myself out here because I've worked on myself and changed and yet I might also still appear a hypocrite.

See, I encourage, support, and show solidarity with reading diversely, with getting the lesser known, marginalized voices out. But I'm also really bad about my reading habits. Currently, I'm leading the Dresden Files Read-Along. A very popular series, and one I love dearly. My Goodreads stats for last year was Dresden Files 1-9, along with four books by Krista (technically all of them proofreading jobs), The Last Wish by Sapkowski, and the first volume of East of West. One woman, who was also paying me to read her, and three men. In 2018, I read two women. Krista and Jane Glatt. Mostly all proofreading again but also I enjoyed the books. In 2016, I attempted to read all women but ultimately failed my own challenge because in the latter half of the year, I started wanting to read more Dresden Files. Because my reading habits are dictated almost entirely by hankerings I get.

You're probably the same, right? If you're like me, you might even go in cycles of reading or watching a lot of movies and shows or playing through some video game or the other. I'm never entirely sure what I'm going to want to read unless it's a major thing. Dresden is a major thing. We're on book 10 now and it's been ten months of Dresden and I've been fine. And hell, maybe that's cause, for me, this is a re-read.

I still desire to make an effort though. But sometimes that's hard. And sometimes, the mood is wrong. Sometimes, even the things that sound interesting aren't wanted. Sometimes, you just don't want to try anything new and unfamiliar. The unfamiliar is also part of why our recommendations are an ouroboros. And then there's the doors. /u/HiuGregg made a [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/em8vej/finding_our_way_into_fantasy_fiction_why_lazily/) about this very thing: how we find our way into fantasy. This can reinforce all of that. Your friend who adores The Kingkiller Chronicles recommends them to you for your first book. And you love them because they're the right door for you and you recommend them and on it goes. Somewhere in there, though, someone will bounce right off that door. It's not right for them. The cycle continues though.

Then there's the concept of *good books*. You only read good books and no one is going to force you to read to a diversity quota, just to make some arbitrary tally mark. If a book is *good*, then, by god, it'll find its way to you. That's how it works, right? It doesn't. Krista's [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4stya7/is_good_good_enough_marketings_effect_on_what_we/) numbers on that too. More importantly though, in your haste to defend your actions, you're implying something about those other books. The ones that apparently aren't good enough: that they're bad. I've seen this a lot too. That the so-called diversity bingo books are all actually bad and that they're only read to score SJW points. And look, I get it, being wrong sucks. It's hard, it feels bad, no one likes it. But here's the thing: **no one recommends books they don't like**.

I'm honestly surprised at how often that point seems to be either ignored or misunderstood. And it's kind of the crux of this whole thing. You're not bad for not reading diversely and you can, in fact, still read whatever the fuck you want. But like, hey, maybe take a chance sometimes. You don't have to radically alter your entire reading habits, I certainly fuckin haven't. But maybe explore outside of your zone of authors sometimes. Like, one book ain't so bad, right? You like epic fantasy? Maybe ask around for women or genderqueer authors of epic fantasy, find the one that sounds the most interesting, and run with that. At the very least, even if you don't like it, it was a new experience.

And hey, lest I continue not showing you I'm there with you, when I first read Krista, of my own free choice, before we became friends, I went into it expecting the cultural bias perception: woman writer = this is gonna be a bunch of romance nonsense. That bias still hasn't entirely gone away. A friend I met through Krista writes a huge urban fantasy universe, that is definitely *not* romance, and something I actually do want to read and my brain still gets apprehensive about trying her stuff out because *what if it's that bad romance stuff*? And hell, KS Villoso's Jaeth's Eye? I tried to read it. I bounced off it. I felt terrible about it cause I really wanted to like it. I even apologized to Kay about it. She's talented. We all know it. I still gave it a shot.

Cause that's the thing: no, we're not calling you racist for not reading more books from folks who aren't white. No, we're not calling you sexist for not reading stuff from women and non-men. No, we're not saying you're an asshole who should feel all the shame while we ring the shame bell and march you down the street shouting shame at you while people belt you with rotten produce. You're not a bad person for not reading diversely. You're a human being, subject to the same cultural and marketing biases we all are.

So maybe, just maybe, go out of your way every so often to read someone you might normally miss or even avoid for some strange reason you may not even fully comprehend. You don't have to do it all the time, or even most of the time, just sometimes.

And if you're one of those people who feels the need to DM someone something shitty: you can do better than that. In the words of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century, ""be excellent to each other and party on, dudes.""",1

545,"Finding Our Way Into Fantasy Fiction: Why lazily reccing the same shit over and over turns people away from the genre# A Brief Introduction

The following essay is something I actually wrote a while back. It touches on the recommendations that we generally give to new readers, and why when we're lazy with those recs, we run the risk of presenting our favourite genre as something quite... stale. When we all know that this is the furthest thing from the truth. Fantasy is a colourful and exciting genre, and we're currently living in a golden age with all the amazing new books being released. But we — and this subreddit in particular — are still recommending the same books as we were five-to-ten years ago.

Following Krista's stats post on [the books we recommended this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/elzylb/what_we_recommended_2019_edition/), and SharadeReads' excellent stabby-winning essay on why there's [a lot more to fantasy than the usually-recommended authors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/cqoe1c/no_you_havent_read_everything_there_is_to_read_in/), I figured it was worth posting this here while we're still having this conversation as a community. I've updated it here and there with some links, but largely this is the same post I wrote for my blog back in July.

# The Essay

A while ago, I had an interesting conversation with a few other readers and writers about the books that had first brought us into the world of fantasy. Or, if we had ever stepped away from fantasy for whatever reason, the books that brought us back. Given that we all run in the same circles and a lot of us are of a similar age, it wasn’t a surprise to me that a lot of the titles we put forward were the same.

**Mistborn** by Brandon Sanderson. **The Wheel of Time** by Robert Jordan. **The Kingkiller Chronicles** by Patrick Rothfuss.

If you’re familiar with the fantasy landscape of the past 15 or so years, then these are likely no surprise to you either. These are the books that are recommended everywhere. The books that are often face-out in the book shops. The books that everyone suggests to a prospective reader, and that fill the replies to any tweet, forum post, or Reddit thread.

And there’s a good reason for that. Kind of. These books have brought *so many* people into a genre that they’ve come to love. There’s a lot of love for them, and a lot of nostalgia behind them. People recommend them to you because, hell, those books brought *them* into the genre, so why shouldn’t they do the same for you?

I thought the same for the longest time. The amount of people I’ve told to read **The Lies of Locke Lamora** by Scott Lynch or **The** **First Law** by Joe Abercrombie is beyond counting. I loved those books, so I felt that others should love them too. A lot of them have. They’re great books.

And so when me and my friends started talking about the doors that brought us into fantasy, I started to form a hypothesis.

What if the reason that so many people were brought into (and brought *back* into) fantasy by, say, Mistborn, was that Mistborn was uncommonly suited to be a *beginner’s* fantasy book?

It made more sense to me the more I thought it through. Sanderson’s prose is very simple and accessible. Mistborn is very fast paced, communicates the idea of a cool, unique world very well, and has a certain un-put-downable quality that is ideal for someone who isn’t already a hardened reader.

Thinking I was on to something, I decided I needed a bigger sample size. [I took to Twitter,](https://twitter.com/HiuGregg/status/1154771492409958400) asked for people to let me know what their intros into fantasy were, and waited for the same low-variety responses I had received before. I thought that when I got them, my point would be proved, and I could set to work at putting together a list of “ideal fantasy intro” books based on the qualities I had highlighted earlier.

And then the replies rolled in. Over 200 of them. And I realized what a colossal, self-obsessed, absolute fucking idiot I was being.

The variety in the responses was huge. Admittedly, you can probably guess at some of them: Harry Potter, Narnia, Earthsea, Twilight, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Dragonlance, Discworld. But there were so many more books that I’d never heard of. A lot of them older books in subgenres that I’d never read, and some of them more recent gems that I’d always meant to read, but had never quite got to.

It reminded me of [Victoria Schwab’s *Tolkien Lecture* o*n Fantasy Literature*](https://www.tor.com/2018/08/13/in-search-of-doors-read-v-e-schwabs-2018-j-r-r-tolkien-lecture-on-fantasy-literature/), which she gave around this time last year in Oxford. During the lecture, Schwab spoke of the importance of “doors” into fantasy. How “required reading” is a dangerous term, and how fantasy fans can still be fantasy fans even if they haven’t read the books that you love. She spoke about how everybody deserves to find their own doorway, how everybody would be different, and how she would continue to write the books that she wanted to read, in the hopes of writing a door for somebody else.

When the replies to my tweet came in, I admit to thinking that some of them wouldn’t have gotten *me* into fantasy. The likes of Dragonlance, Pern, and Narnia had always seemed too dated to me. Some of the urban fantasy suggestions had a few too many vampires for my tastes. I was sure that to the people who replied, these books were excellent, but they weren’t for me.

And so, again, I realized how much of an idiot I was being.

If these books seemed dated to me, then might the books that *I* was recommending seem dated to somebody else?

I checked when Mistborn was published: 2006.

Kingkiller: 2007.

The Wheel of Time: *1990*.

I thought of how much the fantasy landscape had changed in that time. The Harry Potter Movies. The Game of Thrones TV show. These HUGE doors that had brought so many people into fantasy, and with those people brought rapid change. I thought of the huge volume of fantastic fantasy books that have been released in recent years. N.K Jemisin’s **Broken Earth** trilogy. Katherine Arden’s **Winternight** trilogy. The **Divine Cities** by Robert Jackson Bennett. **Heartstrikers** by Rachel Aaron. **The Rage of Dragons** by Evan Winter. **The Books of Babel** by Josiah Bancroft. And so so so so many more. I posted a massive list of [great, recent books around four months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/cuydtk/a_huge_and_completely_arbitrary_list_of_great/). My co-blogger, Travis, has made [recommendation flowcharts with a shit-ton of great books.](https://thefantasyinn.com/category/specialties/flowcharts/)

There have been so many outrageously great books released in even just the past 5 years that it’s ridiculous. And here I was preparing myself to give the same recommendations I was giving 5 years ago. Recommending books that were 13 years old. 29 years old.

And that’s not to say that recommending these books is wrong. They’re great books, and will continue to be great books for the right person. But what if, all of those years ago, someone had handed me a copy of Dragonlance instead of Mistborn? Might be that I wouldn’t be here now. Might be that this website wouldn’t exist.

But that’s not the case, and all because I found my own door rather than being forced through someone else’s. And thanks to staggering number of wonderful books and authors that have come to light in recent years, there are more doors than ever. If things keep going the way they’re going, there’ll soon be even more.

And so there’s no excuse not to steer people towards the door most suited for them. No excuse not to shout about those great, underappreciated, and more recent books that need that little bit more attention to open their doors that bit wider. Because let’s face it, people have been shouting about J.R.R Tolkien and Robert Jordan long enough.

I realize now that the reason I was brought into fantasy wasn’t because the books I read were somehow ideally suited to being “intro” books. They were just ideally suited to being an intro for *me*. It was because they were what I, personally, was looking for at that time, and because other readers had helped open those doors wide enough that it was easy for me to find them.

But those doors are open now. They’re established. And there are other books out there that might be the perfect door for a whole bunch of new readers, but we’ll never know unless we let those readers know that these doors are there.

Perhaps this entire post is just to round off my own hat-trick of idiocy, and I’m saying nothing that isn’t already obvious to everyone that reads it. But I hope not. I know that too often, I’ve been recommending the same books by the same authors, and have been giving these recommendations wrapped in a bow of my own nostalgia. And I’ve seen plenty of others do the same. It’s time to change that. When you’re lazy with your recommendations, you run the risk of turning someone away from a world that they might find a home in.

It’s time to open *all* of the doors as wide as we can, and welcome everyone who steps through them.

# A Reddit-Specific Addendum

Like I said at the beginning of this post, we're currently living through a fantasy publishing golden age. The last five years have seen an ***insane*** amount of great books being released. And for as large a community is this subreddit is... it's quite shocking how behind the times it can be. I used the word ""stale"" earlier. And honestly, yeah. This place is pretty fucking stale nowadays. We're still recommending the same books we were when *I* was a fantasy newbie.

And it's not because these are the ""best"" books. It's because we're stuck in an infinite loop. People join the sub, get recommended books from the top lists, read those books, recommend them to other newcomers to the subreddit, vote for them in the following years top list, and so on and so on.

I'm not saying those books are bad. They're loved for a reason. A lot of them have huge communities behind them, and I think the allure of a welcoming, active community for a book series is something that's often undersold. I won't ever criticise someone for picking up a popular book, or wanting to be part of those communities, because honestly that kind of attitude is just elitism.

My point is that these aren't the *only* great books. But if these are the only books you recommend (or the only recommendations you listen too), you're sure making it seem that way. Guys, there are **so many** great recently-released fantasy books, and **so many** great books that lie outside of the ""common recs"" of this sub. Many of which might fit your tastes so much better than just going through books on a checklist. You're missing a whole world of amazing other worlds if you don't recognise that.",1
546,"Mini reviews from 2019: Stuff you might like2019 can be summed up with ""I read a lot of books written by women living in Ontario Cottage Country who own cats in the plural."" This was not intentional.   


First off, I read all of **Tanya Huff's Confederation series**. I'd read part of it previously, but had run into that bookstore issue of no numbers on the books so ended up buying and reading books out of order. So I started from scratch and did the entire thing in audio. All seven books. I have zero regrets. 

If you're an audiobook person, I strongly recommend them in audio. There is something delightful about listening to the narrator yell at you for 8 straight hours to stop your orgy and put on your damn helmet. (Yes. This is a thing. It's hilarious. It never stops being hilarious.)

I re-read **Jane Glatt's Unguilded** in the goal of reading the follow up novella and novel...but then got distracted by Confederation, and...well..ya know how it goes. I still really enjoy this book. Just a good person fighting injustice and refuses to compromise, and is rewarded for it. God knows that's not the real world, so it's just damn nice to read sometimes.

I caught up on **Skyla Dawn Cameron's Livi Talbot series**, including the novellas/short stories. I really enjoy this series. There aren't enough relic hunter stories in fantasy and I'm a sucker for them.

**Karen Lord's Redemption in Indigo** was such a blow out surprise for me. No one had never described it as charmingly funny before, and so I'd put off trying it because of all of the ""beautiful prose"" comments. Instead, what I found was a fun, if slightly bittersweet, tale with a talking spider. 

I read three more of **Drew Hayes' Fred, The Vampire Accountant** books this year. I took a break from the series and haven't had a change to go back. However, I still recommend it highly for anyone wanting a laid back urban fantasy that's more about ""saving the local neighbourhood"" as opposed to the world. 

I also read the core books for **Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next** series. I thoroughly enjoyed them, though I'm not sure I wish to continue to the new series. I might try one of his other series, instead. They scratched that ""Douglass Adams"" itch for me. The audiobooks were outstanding.  


I read **John Scalzi's Fuzzy Nation** this year and, I gotta say, it tried to push Agent to the Stars out of my favourite Scalzi spot. I also read **Scalzi's Head On**, which was excellent; robot detectives in present setting is my jam. I also read his short story/short novella, **Everything But the Squeal**, which was hilarious.  


I read **Octavia Butler's Bloodchild and Other Stories**. Honestly, I know Bloodchild is \*the\* story of the collection, but it was my least favourite. But, to be fair, I don't like bug stories in general. This is such a great collection with stories for just about all tastes.

I read **Nnedi  Okorafor's Kabu Kabu** collection. I only liked Kabu Kabu (the novella); everything else just didn't sit for me. Yet, I highly recommend this collection because Kabu Kabu was fucking awesome and would make for a fabulous movie or an entire series.

I read **Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang** because I loved Arrival. I hated the short story and struggled to finish it. However, Tower of Babylon was fantastic so I still got something out of the collection.  


Read some non-SFF, which I won't bore anyone with. Except that I know there's a lot of knitters here and I recommend you check out ""Saltwater Mittens."" It's about the knitting of my people.",1

548,"Recommendations for nontheological fantasySo, I have read pretty much all the big name fantasy novels and am always looking for more to read. Last 2-3 yrs I haven't had much time to read however and I have only read the sequels of those published before. But I find myself either not finding these sequels upto the mark compared to earlier, or plain just not able to finish it. Maybe I didn't focus on the religion aspect before and am thinking too much on it these days, but many of the sequels/finale seem to focus too much on theology, The Burning White by Brent Weeks is a prominent example. I want to now start reading new fantasy series. 
Any recommendations for fantasy series that came/started out in last 2-3 yrs and that doesn't rely on deus ex machina or god to end the plot?",1

550,"Spoiler thoughts on The Poppy War's endingI finished the audio version a few days ago (the performance is stellar by the way) and wow, *that ending*.  I haven’t started the Dragon Republic yet and wanted to write this down before the text colored my thoughts. I’m very interested in what other fantasy fans thought. My take:

Despite being obviously telegraphed, the ending still managed to surprise me. It could have been a story about breaking the cycle of violence, and I thought, right up until it happened, that’s what it would be.

The two major flaws about Rin, constantly reinforced by inner monologue and her master, is that she wants power and she holds grudges. BUT she sees the atrocities of war. She sees what the genocide of Speerly does to their survivor. Surely she would be the better person and break the cycle right?

She doesn’t. She **wants power** and she **holds grudges**. Her powerless, demeaning and hopeless childhood saw to that. A childhood shaped by a war society. She nukes the Mugen island.

You expect her experiences to give her more compassion and to see the value of mercy. But it actually has the opposite effect. This is the cycle. What should be unthinkable becomes an option.

I could see somebody interpreting the ending as “sometimes you have to make hard choices”. But I think it has to be a mistake. Not an authorial mistake, but Rin, the broken human fucking up. The Phoenix is very clear. There is no fate, destiny, or the will of the gods. She brought herself here. But humanity, or lack thereof, *did* shape her.

You can see the potential of a good person in Rin. She is hard working, smart and she loves her friends. But she was born into a country defined by war. She is an orphan because of the war. Her foster parents continue to be immense profiteers of that war. When Rin finally succeeds in escaping her childhood, her ONLY option is to go somewhere *to learn war*.

And so she ends up making a huge mistake. And I kind of love that. I can’t think of another story I’ve read that ends like this. Sometimes the character has good intentions but there is an unforeseen twist and it turns out the bad guy was holding back a greater evil. Or sometimes we see an anti-hero go over the edge and become the villain. But, even at the end, I would argue that Rin is not a villain. That's why it's a mistake.

What did you think?",1

552,"Review: A Shadow in Summer by Daniel Abraham*A Shadow in Summer* by Daniel Abraham is one of those fantasy novels that are difficult to quantify in  brief review. It's also an incredibly textured, layered story that peels away gradually, and stylistically clearly has its roots in an Asian-inspired setting.

The heart of the story is that poets control gods, otherwise known as andats, who are bound to do their bidding. The andat of the city of Saraykhet, Seedless, specialises in removing things, be it seeds from cotton or babies from wombs – and a ""sad trade"" as they call it is the pivotal moment that sets a series of events in motion as characters plot and plan around each other. If intrigue is your crack, then *A Shadow in Summer* will provide this in abundance.

[A Shadow in Summer is book one of The Long Price Quartet by Daniel Abraham](https://preview.redd.it/ptbqyzjk3t941.jpg?width=313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2911a910a0edc128f7e4704b2059103c9e6019e)

I'm not going to go into all the characters, except to say that Daniel spends a lot of time laying the groundwork for future machinations – we have a rogue accountant, an accountant's assistant, a prince in hiding, and a poet-in-training. I'd never thought an accountant could have such a devastating adventure, but there you have it. There's young love, betrayal and disappointment. In essence, this novel reminded me a lot of Katherine Addison's *The Goblin Emperor* in that that we don't deal with any cataclysmic events, but there is a slow burn of unravelling events.

Book two is most certainly in my sights, and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to discover Daniel's tales. His writing is detailed and his worlds are solidly realised, and will appeal to fantasy readers who enjoy a slower pace.",1
553,"An Elephant in the Fantasy Inn (Assorted thoughts from a now-mostly-lurker)It was Krista's post that prompted me to finally try and write this, in part because the things she details are completely and utterly unsurprising, and they also helped clarify some things I've been grappling with for a long, long time...including the feeling that I do not belong here, despite earlier, happier times. But at least one thought has larger implications for this community, and I've kept my mouth shut about that for too damn long.

This is not easy to write. If it were, I would have done it - at least the first part - over a year ago. Similarly, I do not expect this to be easy to read. All I can ask is this: make your own choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and then, someone will come in posting a request for books without romance or sex. Many have a recurring theme in the tone of their request, either implicitly or explicitly, one that I identify quickly: these are asexual and/or aromantic readers looking for representation and reprieve from the same old shit.

And, inevitably, some- (\*deep breath\* Rule One, Calli, *Rule One*)...*somebody*, almost always multiple somebodies, will come in to tell them how unrealistic or inappropriate their request is, that it's part of the universal human experience, that what they're asking for is unnatural, blah blah blah-- Look, some of us have heard this garbage so many times we can rattle it off rote. And it *is* garbage.

I do not think a single one of these posters has remained afterward.

I mean...why would they? Their first experience here is a metaphorical punch in the face. ""Welcome to the community, oh we lied, you're not actually welcome.""

I have seen fewer of these posts in the past months. Whether this is coincidence, or something more, I don't know. I personally have held silence, out of fear and anxiety more than anything else. (And yes, that makes me complicit. I know. That is part of why I am speaking now, and hoping it is not too late.)

That is one of the reasons I write out LGBTQIA in full.

Because we are easy - and convenient - to forget.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I see something that seems like something I could contribute to, I think it over for several hours...and almost always decide not to bother. Because...what is the point? All it will lead to is more fear, more anxiety. More awareness that I am out of sync with this community...more realization I do not belong.

There is, after all, a rote and accepted discussion format for books here - and, frankly, probably in most communities:

\-I liked it/I didn't like it/I hated X/I loved Y (circle up to two, explanation/elaboration optional, under two paragraphs please)

This is not a complaint. It's an observation. And when you stop and think about it, it makes sense. An informally formal structure that facilitates conversation, and the simpler the better. It gets people talking, and that is a good thing.

But then I'm over here jotting down this that and the other in the tiny comment box in my netbook's web browser and leaving out a whole bunch of things that I remember hours or days later and after hours of going over and trying to refine word choice and editing down I hit post and OH GOD CALLI WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY CAN'T YOU JUST READ LIKE A NORMAL PERSON

I'm not sure if it's too many literature classes, or if I'm just fundamentally broken in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there is that word that starts with R: Romance.

Krista is 100% correct that there is a problem with the way ""romance"" is used in this subreddit. For those of us who either engage with the genre directly or have tried to understand it, the word ""romance"" is [jargon](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=jargon). (Definition 1) Specific usage, specific connotations, specific requirements, specific situations.

If you're outside that, you have no way of knowing, and there is a good chance that either you do not know where to look, or you are - in various ways - dissuaded from doing so.

It's a communication problem, and one I do not see an easy solution for.

&amp;#x200B;

I have other thoughts about romance as a genre, especially its intersections with the fantastic, but those go beyond the scope of this post. Suffice to say they are painful and unhappy.

&amp;#x200B;

This community used to bring me joy. Now...for years, at this point...it mostly brings fear, anxiety, and sometimes anger. And I am left with the question: is it time to give up, or time to fight back? I don't know. Both have their tolls. Is either one worth the cost?",1

I managed to find a bunch of new and great reads last year and now I want more, to preface this: I prefer romance to be part of the story, but it's not needed, I have no interest in getting recommended anything of the ""big authors"" such as Sanderson, Jordan, Lynch, Rothfuss or Butcher. I've read or tried many of them already and can easily find them by myself, this time around I want those hidden gems! Retellings, magic worlds, anything goes. I'm not too picky about genre tbh.


&amp;nbsp;


* **Red Winter Trilogy** – Annette Marie (3/3)

I loved this, absolutely adored it. It’s based in Japan and features Japanese mythology, and from my rather bare knowledge of it, does it well. 
It’s about a girl, Emi, who has been raised as a priestess to become the host of her goddess. She has known this for a long time and has never doubted this. Then she saves Shiro, a yokai and enemy of her goddess, and everything gets turned on its head for her. She starts to doubt her commitment and suddenly she has to wonder if what she believed was her destiny truly is what she wants. 
The books follow her journey to discover the truth about the gods and yokai, the hosts role in it and her learning to take charge of her own destiny. Set in modern japan while mostly being from the view of Emi as she travels with supernatural creatures and see the world as they do, and occasionally visiting the realms of gods it’s beautifully done. 
There is a romance which I felt developed nicely over the course of the books. 

* **Winternight Trilogy** – Katherine Arden (3/3)

Mythology that isn’t based on fae/Greek/similar European stuff? Yes please. Honestly, I don’t mind the above but having something different is always a big nice plus. And Winternight delivers by being set in medieval Russia when Christianity is on the rise while the old beliefs are being pushed down and away. But our main character Vasya knows better, she has met and spoken to many of the spirits that belong to the old faith and learns from them. We first follow her life from a child until a young woman, while still not an adult. 
The books have a few different conflicts, we have Vasya who doesn’t want to conform to the expections of women, the clash between Christianity and the old faith, as well as the choice between what Vasya has to do to protect her home, and the spirits and what others would like for her. 
The three books have some low points each, but overall, I was more than pleased with them and the relationships Vasya formed with many of the characters. Morozko was a favourite even with how stand-offish he was, which as the trilogy continues is explained, explored and changed. 

* **Crown of Shards** – Jennifer Estep (2/2)

In 2019 I rediscovered my love for fantasy, and this series was a big part of it. 
A somewhat forgotten royal, Everleigh, partly due to her order in the royal succession, and more due to her apparent lack of magic ability, suddenly finds herself being the only survivor of a massacare where every other royal, except her cousin Vasilia, is killed. Thankfully for Evie her immunity to magic lets her escape from Vasilia’s coup. 
She flees and ends up at a gladiatior troupe unsure who she can trust. But as Vasilia continues to take hold of the country it’s becoming more and more obvious that Evie only has one choice, learn to fight so she can save the country, by killing the Queen. 
The magic in this world is lovely, it’s unique. Evie starts out with little less than a backbone to keep her alive but learns how to fight, she makes friends and learns who she can trust once again. I can’t say much about the second book without spoiling much but it deals with consequences of the first book while building up for the plot for the yet to be released book 3. I’m keeping my eye out for that one and I’m unsure how I’ll be able to wait until March for it. 

* **Foundryside** – Robert Jackson Bennett

Another highlight of mine this year. This was recommended to me and I’m darn glad I read it. 
In the world of Foundryside exists a type of magic that works by writing runes on objetcs which convinces them to act in ways they normally wouldn’t, this is called scriving. The main character Sancia is a thief got a job to steal an artefact that could revolutionise scriving. In typical fashion things go wrong and Sancia discovers that perhaps the powers in Tevanne shouldn’t have this artefact and off the story goes. 
Scriving as magic is a really fun and intresting system since it’s based on, by writing commands on objects imbuding them with sentience to perfom according to these commands. This is a big part of the story, of how scriving works and how it’s utilized. 
There’s some romance, very minimal, and barely mentioned until the end. 
I’m keeping my eye out for the sequel that’s announced to be released 20th February this year. 

* **The Alchemist of Loom** – Elise Kova

I came across this by chance and was not disappointed. One of the highlights of my reads this year.
In a world with Fenthri and Dragons as species, and a cross between them called Chimera, you don’t have the standard fantasy races. You have two widely different societies and cultures that end up clashing when the two main characters meet. Ari, a Fenthri, finds Cvareh, a Dragon, and when he offers her a boon she decides helping him is more favourable than selling his organs. 
It’s an interesting world with magic and steampunk elements that work together to create a unique world of Fenthri who can’t use magic but can create amazing contraptions and machines while the Dragons can use magic but miss the ingenuity of the Fenthri.
The story is told through a number of different point of views with Ari and Cvareh being the two main narrators which gives us two wildly different views of the happenings and opinion on how certain obstacles should be approached while also giving us insight into the characters and how they are viewed and views others. Definitely recommending this one, and I’m planning to read the sequels in short order.",1
556,"""Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron"" by Jasper Fforde - A ReviewI just finished reading *Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron* by Jasper Fforde and I loved it. This is a book set in a very strange society where what colour you can see is the main determiner of social standing and where the society runs on strict adherence to arcane rules.

After ""Something that Happened"" a long time ago, people can perceive none, one or two of the primary RGB colours, and which colour and to what degree determines your place in society. The main character is a young ""red"" boy (the lowest social rank after ""grey"" - or colourblind) and the son of a swatchman (a doctor who uses specially prepared colours to influence people's bodies to heal them) who is sent out to a rural village and tries to fit in.

Society runs off of the rules - a very complicated set of edicts which are religiously followed in spite of being full of holes, nonsensical contradictions and just plain oddities. For example (pretty minor spoilers for something early on), &gt;!everyone has a postal code, which is immutable for life. Mail is always sent to where you were born and then redirected through everywhere you lived, so the more you move around, the longer it takes to get mail. Sometimes mail gets caught in a redirection loop, moving around for every. One minor character is on-the-run from the authorities because he decided to burn some mail caught in a loop like this, for which the recipient had been dead 50 years.!&lt;

It has a bizarre, often humorous quality - talk of the risks of swan attack is common throughout the novel. It winds up feeling a lot like what you might expect something like 1984 to become given an extra few centuries of disorganized politicians editing history and enforcing regulations with no clear idea where they came from or why.

Disclaimer that is also a spoiler: &gt;!It does have the fairly standard problematic trope of lead romantic couple that start off extremely antagonistic.!&lt;

Overall, if you like the idea of a quirky and somewhat humorous spec-fic set in a very odd dystopia, I do recommend.",1
557,"Quick Question (Wheel of Time)I am not looking for spoilers here so please don't...  I started reading this series Monday at work, and I am currently into book 4 and had a burning question till the very end of book three... but I thought I would still ask anyway.

Is this 1 story?  The pacing seemed incredibly fast for 2.9 books(Rand's ""progression"", prophetic progression, etc), the ""ending"" of the third book alleviated my unease a bit but... is there 1 main antagonist in this story, or is the story really a 2-3 parter(EG Balgariad/Mallorean).",1
558,"My 2019 in books - 49 books2019 for me was a difficult year. I joined the army, which took up a lot of my time. In the army, I lost access to a lot of the things I loved to do - I couldn't see my family or friends, I couldn't work out when I wanted to (and how I wanted to). I couldn't bake, or code cool stuff, or play games. I couldn't bike or sleep or do any other number of things.

But I had my phone, and a kindle app.

So I read. At first, in basic training, we only received our phones for one hour each day, and you were also expected to shower and speak to family during that one hour. Most days I was so exhausted from the new, unfamiliar surroundings, from being 24/7 around people, that I would just enter my room, sit on the bed, and stare into space thinking about literally nothing. Suddenly I'd notice that half an hour had passed, and I'd yet to even shower.

Aside from the days where I was mentally exhausted, there were also days where I was physically exhausted. So in that first month, I'll admit I didn't get much reading done. However, eventually I acclimated to my new surroundings, and for the next few months of my basic training, even if it was for fifteen, ten, or even five minutes, I made sure to read just a bit every day. It was what I looked forwards to, and it let me recharge after an entire day of being surrounded by tens of people 24/7.

Eventually, Basic ended and rather than not having enough time, I found myself with too much time, rather. So I developed myself. I challenged myself to read outside of my comfort zone, I started playing chess again. I learned from the internet to sew and patch basic things, and I tried a bit of writing. Things that you can do anywhere if you have a few basic tools.

And of course, I kept reading fantasy. So without further ado, here's what I read in 2019.

That ends up being 51^(*) books. Outdated title! I read with certainty more web serials than listed, although I can't remember their names off the top of my head unfortunately! But hey, ffifty is a pretty rad number.

**Reading Insights**  

My longest unbroken streak of reading was 29 days in a row of reading from my kindle, from Sep. 20 to Oct. 18. It doesn't include reading from web serials (which I probably do more than reading from kindle), so it's probably a larger number (if there was a day I read web serials but not from kindle), but hey that's still cool!

I read 38 weeks in a row from my kindle.  

Kindle tells me how many days I've read during each month, for the past six months. So far I've read 8 days january, 22 December, 18 November, 26 October, 28 September, and 16 August.

----------------------

That's all. 2019 was a pretty good year for reading, perhaps my best (or at least in the top 3, if not!!). I challenged myself to read a few classics, went out of my way to read a few female authors, and read a lot of self-pub. I had waaaay too much time on my hands after finishing Basic.

Enjoyment: ⭐⭐⭐💫

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I had kept my eyes down while Father used suppers to praise his precocious daughter and recount my failures—of the day, of the week, of the year, those disappointments never left to scab over and heal. I fought the tears I couldn’t shed by counting the fan-tailed birds on Mother’s favorite tablecloth. Grace would be a Storm-Singer; I was a Secondary, destined to become my sister’s thrall.

The entire time I was reading Witchmark, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons to another historical romance I loved - Hither, Page by Cat Sebastian. Although Hither, Page, doesn’t have the same fantasy elements as does Witchmark, it touches on many of the same themes: trauma, healing, and trust, specifically within the context of PTSD following service in the war. Both have a murder mystery element, and both allow for the two romantic leads to come together as they work as a team both to heal old wounds and find the murderer. Witchmark, however, takes this all a step further by introducing stakes that affect not only the immediate characters, but also the world as a whole. The introduction of magic and prejudice against non-aristocracy magic users adds in a new level of politicking and intrigue.

Miles is the son of a politically connected mage who sits atop the secret magical hierarchy that keeps Aeland stable and functioning, but he is reluctant to “do his duty” to the family and take his place as a Secondary to his sister. In Aeland, Secondaries are mages who have less obvious talent despite having a large pool of innate magic; thus, they are magically bound as glorified thralls to their Primary mage. Witches, low-class mages, are “known” to go mad and are sent to insane asylums in the countryside. Given that Miles has shucked off his connections to his family name, he risks just that fate if anyone at his psychiatry practice discovers his magical aptitude. Although his family would protect him if he were found out, it would mean becoming his sister’s magical slave.

&gt;“I’ve attended hearings and read transcripts. Do you know the most common proof of a witch’s madness?”   
“Delusions.”  
“Specifically, a delusion that moves them to accuse others of being witches. They usually name people from the highest levels of society: Royal Knights.”

Thus, when a strange man comes to his hospital bearing a witch who claims he’s been murdered just before he passes away in Miles’ care… Miles is justifiably concerned that the man witnessed him attempting to perform magic to save the man’s life. Miles is expecting blackmail, demands for reparations, or, worse, for him to go straight to the authorities. Much to Miles’ surprise, Tristan does not threaten to turn him in. Instead, he reveals himself as a fellow witch and offers a bargain: if Miles will assist him in finding the murderer, then Tristan will teach Miles as much about magic as he’s able up until the winter solstice.

&gt;“No one has ever used it,” Tristan said. “You’re my first guest.”  
“Thank you for letting me stay.”  
He held the shirt out. “You could stay here, you know. Until I have to leave.”  
“As your guest?”  
“I can’t ask you to give up your work for learning magic and catching murderers. You’re a healer. You’d never do it.”  
“You’re right.”  
He stepped closer. “We need every minute you can spare, Miles. It’s a good solution.”  
I took the folded shirt from his hands. “It’s sensible.”  
“Practical.”  
He lived closer to the hospital. The room was comfortable. We’d spend our evenings in each other’s company in privacy. For the sake of learning, for the investigation.

Thus sets off both our plot and our romance. It would be hard not to root for this pair; Miles is a kind-hearted soul who really does deserve happiness, so it’s a joy to watch him accept that Tristan isn’t the cold-hearted fae he initially believes. Their interactions are heart-warming and generally adorable. My one complaint is that they don’t officially get together as a couple until the very end of the novel; I was hoping to have more of the “we’re a real couple and we support the heck out of each other” goodness that I most enjoy in my romance. Given that the sequel, Stormsong, follows Miles’ sister, Grace, I’m not anticipating that I’ll get that out of the sequel, either. C’est le vie, not all books will cater to me, I suppose.

Some of the overarching themes present in this book include mental health and personal agency. As Miles struggles with PTSD from his time in the war, Tristan must help support and understand the unique challenges he faces. Many small things trigger panic or upset, due to connections with his time in the service. Sometimes, these are small and only recall intrusive thoughts or sensory disruption. Other times, they can be quite severe. Grace often uses both his coping mechanisms and her knowledge of his past against him as a method of removing his agency. Although Grace promises at the start of the novel that she will not bind him without his consent, she is ultimately caught up in the conspiring of their father, who forces the issue. Magic, it seems, doesn’t recognize that “consent” under duress is not true consent. Miles is caught between a rock and a hard place as he attempts to assert his own agency at the detriment of his sister.

&gt;She turned her attention on me, the cords of her throat straining to hold back the full gale of her emotion. “I need you, Miles. I mourned you. I couldn’t stop dreaming you were a ghost, and you were alive this whole time. When I needed you.”   
“Me, or my obedience?”   
“My brother. Our family. I know you never saw eye to eye with Father, but you have leverage now.”

Grace claims to want reform amongst the upper class mages. She fundamentally agrees with Miles that the treatment of Secondaries is abhorrent as it currently stands. However, she also firmly believes that the only way to change the system is from within it. She views Miles as her ticket to power, and isn’t above using him to take it. She’s very much a hypocrite; even as she forces Miles’ to play his role, she claims that she wants Secondaries to have choice and freedom.

As the various politics of the characters begin to collide, one of my favorite scenes in instigated: the bicycle chase! Given that cars aren’t yet common during the time period, bicycles are the primary mode of transportation for most people in Aeland. Carriages exist, of course, but they’re slow in comparison and horses are expensive to care for. So, when Miles happens to be carrying some documents relevant to the murder and notices he’s been followed… cue the chase.

&gt;He turned right. Me, then. In spite of it all, I grinned. If he wanted me, he’d have to catch me. I cut across drafts and drove into the intersection before twisting my bike in a hard turn, straight up a short, steep hill. Climb that, blackguard. Let’s see how you do. I stood on my pedals and muscled it out, but he was in better shape than I supposed and soon I was speeding along a street heavy with foot traffic crisscrossing from shop to shop in pursuit of the day’s errands. I rang my bell, shouted warnings, and dodged alarmed customers who shook their fists at me, then squawked in outrage when my pursuer came flying after.

The sequel to Witchmark, titled Stormsong, will be released on February 11th, 2020. I was fortunate enough to be offered an advance copy for review, so keep on the look out! While Grace was one of my least favorite characters in Witchmark due to her horrific treatment of Miles, I’m incredibly curious about where C. L. Polk will take her character and how she might find redemption after her awful behavior. I’m hoping to see revolution and a change of the old guard in Aeland’s government, though naturally I’ll have to read and find out.

561,"Series Review: Off the Grid by Alyssa Cole - the world might be ending but we still get our HEAs 

Something a little different today, I’m going to be reviewing this entire trilogy of science fiction romance novels — ***Off The Grid*** by Alyssa Cole. This series is set in modern times and the first book, ***Radio Silence***,  features starts out a couple of months after the electricity goes out.  No one seems to know what’s going on as there is no communication from  the authorities. After holding things down in the city for a while  things start to get dangerous as law and order breaks down so Arden and  her roommate John decide to trek up to John’s parent’s place, a secluded  house in the country. When they get there they find John’s brother  Gabriel and his sister Maggie but their parents left the previous week  and haven’t come back, they all fear the worst. Sparks fly between Arden  and Gabriel but will they get over their immediate dislike of each  other to explore their chemistry? Well, of course, this is romance! :)

These are first and foremost romance  novels, and Alyssa Cole does her thing here playing with romance tropes  while keeping things fresh and new feeling. Besides the amazing  chemistry between the couples in each book (really, Alyssa Cole is like  the master of chemistry in romance novels–all that UST just sparking  right off the pages) I really loved the family dynamics between the  siblings and also the friendship between Arden and John. Arden and  Gabriel’s romance was fantastic and one of my favorite set ups with  people misunderstanding each other right off the bat and then, having  come to know each other better, falling in love. It’s kind of the  classic Elizabeth/Darcy set up and I am alllll about it. I also loved  the sense of tension that she created with the uncertainty of the  situation–the power has gone out and no one knows why. They don’t know  if they world’s been attacked by aliens or some country or if it’s  something else. There’s an underlying fear that works really well.

Each of the books focuses on a different  sibling and each romance is a little different–something I really  appreciate because romance can get so formulaic (it is, after all, the  only genre that demands a certain kind of ending so you always know what  to expect to some extent). The second novel, ***Signal Boost***, takes place a months after *Radio Silence*  and focuses on John. There still hasn’t been any communication about  what caused the power to go out or if the government is still  functioning. Society has been left on its own for the most part and  John’s family is making do as best they can, living off the land and  their dwindling supplies. Can I just say how much I appreciated this  book? I read a lot of romance series that focus on a group of friends or  siblings, but they’re always all straight romances! It’s so great to  have a mix of different kinds of romances within the same series  because, well, isn’t that how life is??? Thank you, Alyssa Cole! I  really loved John’s romance, it was very sweet. But also this book gives  us a lot more info on what’s happened in the world and why the power  went out, some things that have been happening with the government. I  really appreciated all the science in this one!

The last book, ***Mixed Signals***,  features Maggie and her romance with a family friend. This one takes  place a few years after the last one. Maggie is going away to college  (the first school to reopen since the power outage) and while things are  still a bit unstable, society is trying to make a new normal. I loved  the set up in this one for the romance. ‘My brother’s best friend’ is  also a romance trope I’m a fan of and it’s done really well here. I love  that we see Maggie coming into her own here, trying for the college  experience even though things are far from the way they used to be. I  also love how she makes some new friends and has to learn not to just  instantly judge people. Sometimes people aren’t who they might seem on  the surface. I also loved the world building in this, the way that  society has broken down and groups have formed seems pretty on point.

Each of the books have a good mix of  action and romance. They sometimes deal with darker things–trauma,  assault, sexual assault, etc–but they are ultimately romances so even if  there are some dark things you know that things will turn out okay for  our characters in the end. Ovearall, I really loved these books and read  them all fast because I just couldn’t get enough of them. **5/5 stars.**",1
562,"QTL Review: Blood of an Exile by Brian NaslundAlright, I am going to be honest here; I did Brian Naslund a disservice when I judged his debut book, *Blood of an Exile*, by its name and cover and shelved it for later. Although I hated both title and art, after finishing the novel I have to admit that they suit the book perfectly, and I am just being a judgmental ass. Released back in August of last year, the book is the start of the Dragons of Terra series and definitely would have been a contender for my top of 2019 list had I actually got to it in a timely manner. I apologize, Brian Naslund, and hopefully this review will slightly make it up to you.

*Blood of an Exile* is a book with powerful characters, a rich world, and a fairly inventive plot. Ostensibly, the story follows our protagonist Silas Bershad the Flawless, a man who was sentenced to exile as a dragonslayer for crimes that are revealed throughout the narrative. To be a dragonslayer is a death sentence, and they are forced to roam the land helping towns and cities kill dragons until they die (usually very quickly). However, Bershad refuses to go down and has managed to make a name for himself as the most famous and successful dragonslayer in the world. Very soon after we meet Bershad, he receives a task from the man who exiled him with the promise of freedom should he complete it. Using his status as a famous dragonslayer, Bershad is to sneak into a neighboring country that is gearing up for war, kill a king and save an innocent child in captivity, and then make it back alive with the child in hand. To fail would mean dying an exile, to succeed would mean saving the country that hates him and his freedom.

Initially, this book was looking a bit trope-y and I was concerned I was going to read something I had already experienced hundreds of times before. However, Naslund rapidly disabused me of this notion by showing *Blood of an Exile* is more than meets the eye. First off, while Bershad is our main protagonist, the story is actually told by four major POVs, an alchemist, an assassin, a princess, and Bershad himself – each of which holds a key piece of the narrative that slot nicely together. The major themes of the book are nature, ecosystems, and how destroying key pieces of any environment can greatly upset the balance. Multiple of the POV’s (including Bershad) are dragon lovers. While they recognize that they are dangerous animals that can cause great harm, dragons are common in this world and are a key piece of every ecosystem they are a part of. While *Blood of an Exile* is very much an action-packed adventure fantasy, it is also a story about amateur scientists desperately trying to keep humanity from destroying the Earth for fiscal gain – an angle I was not expecting and loved in equal parts. There is a huge focus on the study of dragons and the understanding of their nature. This does a very powerful job of painting them as real living and breathing creatures.

The world-building is phenomenal, with the various political entities feeling like they have clear and memorable identities that aren’t just cut and pasted real-world countries. The cast are all fantastic, even down to the side characters. Even the villains aren’t motivated by the simple goals and are engaging to read and think about. The book does an incredible job exploring how the quest for the betterment of civilization can cause horrible unforeseen problems if you aren’t very careful. Naslund does a very good job using a magical fantasy setting to get you to think about your own waste and usage in the modern world, so expect to be a little uncomfortable.

As for negatives, there are only a few. Although I found the book to be an exciting and compelling read, I felt as though there was a small mismatch in the narrative style and strengths of the book. The characters in *Blood of an Exile* are treated as tools to move the story along. They are picked up and put down as needed only when their POV makes sense to further the narrative. What this means is that it can sometimes feel like certain characters were getting uneven page time. This felt a bit odd, given that the characters of this book are so strong that I would have been happy to just spend time in their head. The aforementioned princess POV is one of my favorite protagonists, and she shows up as a POV only in the back half of the book with little to no warning. I would have liked a little more even pacing with my time with each character. The book is also fairly crass; which isn’t a problem for me, but it’s something others might take issue with.

In the end, *Blood of an Exile* was a surprising gem of a book that went unnoticed by many in 2019. It brilliantly combines exciting action, sympathetic characters, smart themes, and a deep world to create a coherent and unique story. It is always rare when you find a book that is both smart and fun at the same time, and *Blood of an Exile* has both in spades. Brian Naslund should be very proud of his debut book, and I can’t wait for the sequel, Sorcery of a Queen, which comes out this year.

Rating: *Blood of an Exile* – 8.5/10

563,"A question regarding Lies Sleeping (Rivers of London series)I listened to this as an audiobook, and don't have access to a physical copy. Towards the end of the book,  I could have sworn there was mention of a painting hanging in The National Gallery, by Foxglove. I didn't catch it at the time but I think the title might have been Peter the Librarian? Does anyone know what it was actually called?",1
564,"Thoughts on David Gemmell's Waylander?I bought this book at a used book store and it looks like a rather quick read. I read the back cover and found the summary to be intriguing, from what I can gather it's a traditional heroic fantasy treasure hunt. Is the book worth reading? It's not too long and the plot looks interesting, and did those of you who have read it enjoy it immensely? Or is it not worth my time?",1
565,"Female Author recommendationsI am writing this post in response to [u/KristaDBall](https://www.reddit.com/user/KristaDBall/) 's post [What We Recommend 2019 Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/elzylb/what_we_recommended_2019_edition/) in which they assert that the female authors are not recommended in proportion to the amount they are published. So here are a few female fantasy authors that I have read and recommend. I am not limiting myself to recent publications and also not mentioning any sci-fi. Despite the fact that the intention is exposure of female authors I fully expect many to be well know if perhaps not recommended as often. With this showing up early in the year maybe a few will try out the ones they don't know and if they enjoy them, recommend them going forward. I am also sure many female authors are getting recommended on the thread above as I was about to do before fleshing it out into a full post.

3. The Edge Chronicles - The creatures and places in this series are really well done.

Men. We recommended men.

# BACKGROUND

In 2016, I wrote “Is Good Good Enough” whereby I started a small counting of recommendations.

&gt;Out of 299 total recommendations, 233 (78%) were male authors. Common names that appeared consistently were Erikson, Lawrence, Sanderson, Martin, and Abercrombie. Interestingly enough, Brian Staverly is mentioned more than I would have expected (3 threads), and referred to as underrated and never talked about. His fans should take heart that he is talked about at least some of the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Female authors represented 53 (18%—look familiar?) with Robin Hobb being well in the top. There were no consistent recommendations after her. Interestingly enough, Ursula K. Le Guin was recommended significantly less than I thought she’d be (only 1 thread).  
&gt;  
&gt;4% (13 mentions) were for unknown gender, genderqueer, multi-author, fanfic, and unpublished webserials. No surprise here that Hickman and Weis came up a few times.

In 2017, “I wrote Because Everyone Loves It When I Count Threads, Here’s Some Gender Data” (I still hate the title.)

&gt;Out of the total 749 recommendations provided, 506 (68%) were for male authors, and 223 (30%) were for female authors. The remaining 20 were for multi-author, genderqueer authors, or no record I could find.  
&gt;  
&gt;68 of the female author mentions were from the female-only threads. There was also 1 comment complaining about female-only threads, and 2 comments recommending the Wurts/Feist co-authored series in the female-only threads.  
&gt;  
&gt;I pulled three threads where the original post asked for beginner fantasy recommendations, be it for themselves or others. Out of 56 recommendations, 45 were male authors (80%) and 11 female (20%).

In 2018, I wrote “Recommendations: Predictions, Perceptions, and Realities”. We saw an overall distribution of 63% male recommendations, 33% female, 4% multi author, and 0.16% genderqueer authors.

I’ve also covered reviews and top lists previously. Please see the link at the bottom of the post.

So now, let’s look at 2019.

# How Tabulation Works

For consistency, I've used the same methods as before:

* I’ve searched by terms (listed below) and ordered by “last year.” Then I picked from **clearly 2019** (for future reference, I am posting this Jan 8, 2020). I tried to pick larger threads whenever possible.
* If a person recommended three different series by one author, I counted that as one recommendation, not three.
* I didn’t count secondary comments replying to main recommendations with “I recommend this, too!” since many of those were merely off-shoot discussion threads.
* Percentages might not always work out to 100% due to rounding. There is no adjustment.
* I class people by the pronouns they use currently.
* “Multi” refers to co-authors (regardless of gender), magazines, and anthologies. It also covers manga, graphic novels, TV, and unknown gender of web serial authors. This also covers recommendations for book universes with several authors, such as Conan, when no specific author is identified. This also includes links to other r/Fantasy threads.
* EDIT: All threads are single-user threads, excepting under ""General and Daily"". Three of those were from the Daily Recommendation threads.

**2019 Recommendation Threads**

I evaluated 29 recommendations threads spread across 2019:

* 5 “New to Fantasy”
* 4 “Epic” or “Big series”
* 5 Grimdark, military, or “realistic”
* 5 Romance
* 5 “More like X”, with X being books, TV shows, or authors
* 5 General recommendations and “daily” threads

I’ve added previous years’ averages to show annual changes, but the “raw” data column is from 2019 only.

|Gender|Raw|2019%|2018%|2017%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Male|915|70%|63%|68%|
|Female|349|27%|33%|30%|
|Multi|31|2%|4%|\-|
|Genderqueer|3|&lt;1%|0.16%|\-|

&amp;#x200B;

This is the second lowest performance of female authors since the first time I’ve done this (Is Good Good Enough, with only 18% female authors read in 2016, was the lowest). Very few resident female authors are recommended now compared to other years.

# Individual Recommendations

I decided to pull apart our recommendations to see what we’re recommending, and how many recommendations are in a reply.

For **New to Fantasy**, we recommended 82% male authors, 15% female authors, 3% multi. Of the male authors, all but one author was white. No genderqueer authors were recommended in the threads I surveyed. As a reference point, SFWA’s membership in 1974 is estimated to have been 18% female.

This is the breakdown of the raw numbers:

&amp;#x200B;

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|70|80%|16%|4%|\-|
|2|38|84%|11%|5%|\-|
|3|36|78%|22%|\-|\-|
|4|37|86%|14%|\-|\-|
|5|134|82%|14%|4%|\-|

The top five authors recommended for New-to-Fantasy readers were:

1. Sanderson (19)
2. Abercrombie (14)
3. Rothfuss (14)
4. Jordan (11)
5. Lynch (11)

For **Epic and Big Series** recommendations, we see similar trends. 79% of the authors recommended were men, with 18% female, and 3% multi-author. No genderqueer authors were recommended in the threads I surveyed.

&amp;#x200B;

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|102|85%|13%|2%|\-|
|2|24|83%|13%|4%|\-|
|3|39|69%|26%|5%|\-|
|4|17|83%|15%|3%|\-|
|5|66|79%|18%|3%|\-|

&amp;#x200B;

The top five authors recommended for Epic and Big Series readers were:

1. Jordan (14)
2. Erikson (14)
3. Sanderson (10)
4. Abercrombie (9)
5. Hobb (8)

For **Dark/Realism/Military**, we see near identical results. Male authors were 79% of the recommends, with 19% female authors, 2% multi-authors, and &lt;1% genderqueer authors.

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|85|82%|13%|4%|1%|
|2|20|78%|22%|\-|%|
|3|9|78%|25%|\-|\-|
|4|11|75%|25%|\-|\-|
|5|30|70%|30%|\-|\-|

&amp;#x200B;

I did not do a top authors list for this category.

The **general recommendation threads, along with posts in the daily recommendation thread**, saw more female author representation. 73% of the recommendations were for male authors, 25% for female authors, only 1% for multi-author, and &gt;1% for genderqueer.

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|105|75%|24%|\-|1%|
|2|38|71%|26%|\-|3%|
|3|24|88%|8%|4%|\-|
|4|20|75%|25%|\-|\-|
|5|96|67%|31%|2%|\-|

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not surprising that the bulk of the female recommendations happened in **Romance** recommendation threads, even though 3/5 of the threads I looked at were for male protagonists and/or male-gaze romance. Men were recommended 28%, with 67% of female authors being recommending. 5% were for multi-authors (exclusively Feist/Wurts and Ilona Andrews). No genderqueer authors were recommended in the threads I surveyed.

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|107|36%|59%|5%|\-|
|2|17|12%|88%|\-|\-|
|3|15|7%|93%|\-|\-|
|4|20|5%|95%|\-|\-|
|5|39|28%|67%|5%|\-|

The top recommended authors for this category is a complete and total mess. Marillier and Bujold tied for the top (4 each). After that, it was basically all a tie of Hobbs, Sanderson, Rothfuss, J. Carey, Sullivan, Sapkowski, GGK, and…the list just goes on. Glen Cook was also recommended once.

Personal commentary: I feel that r/Fantasy really does not understand what people are asking for when someone asks for “romance.” This sometimes also counts for the person asking for “romance.”

We always get threads asking for “**More Like X**” where X is either a book series, TV show, or author. We see 81% male authors recommended in these, with 19% female, and only &lt;1% multi-author. No genderqueer authors were recommended in the threads I surveyed.

|\# of Reco|Total Reco|Male|Female|Multi|Genderqueer|

# Personal Commentary

If I’m going to be honest, I’m not surprised, but I am disappointed. There’s a lot of forces and factors that caused this change. I’m going to cover a few observations I’ve made, and also comments from people on social media (I was sharing these findings as I was tabulating).

**Non-popular author recommendations are ignored.**

We would rather reply to Sword of Truth being recommended than respond to a Kate Elliot recommendation. Rarely does anyone respond to an unknown/uncommon recommendation with, “can you tell me more about this person/book.” However, we will absolutely engage in entire side conversations about Sanderson, often several times in the same recommendation thread. We have no problem trash talking Rothfuss back and forth in a recommend thread…but we will completely ignore an uncommon, but excellent, recommendation. Someone on Twitter replied that she gave up giving recommendations here because she knew she’d just be ignored.

**The YA Insult**

OPs themselves sometimes only reply to male author recommendations, or ask things like “is this YA” in reply to female authors. In perhaps the most egregious example, Anna Smith Spark was referred to as YA. In another example, The Poppy War is often referred to as having a “YA tone” or “YA style,” yet it is not listed as YA anywhere on the publisher’s categories on Amazon.

Yet, Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn is categorized by its publisher as Teen and Young Adult (hardcover) and Teen &amp; Young Adult Wizards &amp; Witches Fantasy (paperback and mass media). However, this book is only referred to as YA when using it as an insult against his writing. This “YA as an insult” tends to be weaponized more against female authors than male ones.

One female author on Twitter replied to me that she is often categorized as romance and YA by male readers, even though the books are not YA nor romance.

**Everyone’s Tired**

I don’t think this one needs much explaining, honestly. A lot of regulars here have young kids now, are struggling financially, are weighed down by the world’s problems…and they just can’t handle someone telling them “I only read good books.” After six years, I’m honestly tired of it, too.

Some of us want to do “Depth Years” in our hobbies, and are trying to read through what we already own. There’s a pressure on some of our readers that they have to keep reading new releases and not finish ongoing series because they have to stay ahead of the tide of a small group of white male authors who already have such significant publisher financial support that they don’t need anyone’s help at this stage.

# Going Forward into 2020

In 2018, I wrote:

&gt;I think r/Fantasy regulars need to be patient with the influx of “read Mistborn, it’s the best book ever written” comments

I am, admittedly, less patient. I understand that folks want to read Wheel of Time before the show comes out. At the same time, a lot of the female regulars are confiding in me that they’re tired of doing most of the work and being ignored. It’s a sad state of affairs when female authors have said to me that there’s no point in posting, since they’ll be ignored anyway.

I’m not sure how we can address the current situation we find ourselves. Previously, we hammered away with facts and recommendations, mini hyper trains, and the like. Those are time consuming, however. Yet, I hate to see so much ground lost.

I have personally been resistant to the notion that r/Fantasy has entered the Eternal September, but I suspect we have crossed that line. With that said, I refuse to give up all of the work that’s been done here. I largely gave up recommending books in 2019; I won’t be making that same mistake in 2020.

As Joanna Russ said, “Clearly it’s not finished. You finish it.” So, yeah. I guess it’s not finished yet.

*Some of the history and buff content has been copied from previous threads I’ve written, as well as my collection of my* r/Fantasy *and personal essays. All of the 2019 data is new.*

# STOP.

Are you compelled to reply with any of the following?

* “Maybe more men write fantasy, have you thought of that”
* “More men read fantasy, so that’s why there are more male authors”
* “…romance…”
* “This is reverse sexism”
* “Why would you even care about the gender?”
* “…meritocracy…”
* “Maybe women should step it up and write better”

Please reference your particular statement in [BUT WHATABOUT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c8fduu/but_whatabout_a_comprehensive_list_of_links/). All of these things have been addressed frequently and are covered in this thread. If you are genuinely curious, I recommend that’s where you start.",1
570,"Books with a good romance?Pretty simple request, really. I’ve read a lot of good, plot heavy books, and ones with a lot of character development recently, but now I’m itching for a good romance. I heard somewhere that Codex Alera has an excellent romance, so I started reading that, but if that flops I would like something to read afterwards. Thanks!",1
571,"What We Recommend: Read More Books By Womenu/KristaDBall has posted an in-depth analysis of a sample of recommendation threads in 2019, and the overwhelming consensus is that as a community, we primarily recommend books by men. 70% of recommendations actually, with books by women making up only 27% of books recommended on r/fantasy. And that's a shame.

There's been some great discussion [in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/elzylb/what_we_recommended_2019_edition/), so I urge you to head over there if you haven't already. But that's not the point of THIS thread. I want you (yes, you) to recommend your favourite books by women. Tell people what they're missing out on. Tell them where they should go to next in their journey through sff.

Please include a bit of information about the book. What's the plot? Why did you like it?",1
572,"Follow-up on my own post: How to stay on top of new books?I recently posted this [asking how to stay up to date with publications.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ehqi7l/how_do_i_stay_up_to_date_with_new_publications/) I got a lot of helpful answers, such as subscribing to newsletters.

So, I've subscribed to a lot of publisher newsletters, but there's a ""new  release index"" that Bookriot has. Unfortunately, there's a fee. And  while I'm sure the fee is warranted, I was wondering if there was  something similar for free? Something like a calendar that showed new  releases?

Thanks :)",1
573,"Struggling to find Fantasy books from different placesBasically, I am wondering if there is any way to find fantasy books that take place or pull from less common sources and cultures (Asian, Middle eastern, African, etc.). I am currently writing a novel (aren't we all) and I realize that a lot of my settings are traditional euro-centric types found in most common and popular fantasy. I want to expand my horizons and be engulfed in settings that don't involve the same old taverns and fortresses and other common western fantasy tropes. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1
574,"Do you ever ""overload"" on fantasy?I've been asked this question a few times in the past, but only recently when discussing my favorite fantasy settings did I really sit down and think about the fact that my resounding ""No! Never!"", may not be as accurate as I'd assumed.

We were talking about the possibility of saturation of appreciation, of our likelihood that we would eventually tire of any single ""perfect"" setting if we could allow ourselves to be taken up by it. My example was an eternal fall. A world where a perfect autumn day passes on endless cycle. My immediate gut reaction to that is that I would LOVE to live in such a place, but further thought had me debating how long it would be before I missed some snow, or some heat, or some storm and rain.

From there, the broader consideration got brought up. Fantasy has been a staple in my life since I was about 6, and in almost 25 years that hasn't changed. But could it? Will it? I don't really fear the possibility, because I imagine I will always come back, but has anyone who considers fantasy extremely important in their lives every been ""overloaded"" by it?",1
575,"Looking for a specific type of underdog storyHi everyone. So, I'm pretty hyped for the last couple of books in the Legends of the First Empire series, and was also a big fan of Riyria. Upon thinking, there's one thing in particular that I want to read more about. I want to read more stories where the protagonist(s) are heavily outclassed in weaponry, magic, or whatever else is used for warfare, **with one or two exceptions**. 

In Legends of the first Empire, this manifests as the protagonists being outclassed by elves physically, but having a few elite elves fighting on their side. They are also outclassed magically, but have a couple of mages on their side. 

Another example might be Mistborn, if you were to make the argument that one Mistborn is roughly equal to one Steel Inquisitor. Red Rising could be another example, since golds and obsidians are physically superior to everyone else. All pretty standard underdog revolution type setups. But they don't always follow this trend. For example, OG Star Wars has 2 Jedi and 2 Sith and the main difference is strength in numbers plus one Death Star.  

Anyways if anyone has a book that can scratch this itch, I'd love to hear it! Thanks all.",1
576,"Other ethnicities' fantasy subgenres (like wuxia/xianxia)?The West has its Tolkien-style, Arthurian-cycle-style, and swords &amp; sorcery style stories, the Chinese has its wuxia-style, xianxia-style and xuanhuan-style, the Japanese has its isekai-style... are there any such sub-genres for other cultures? Like, I know India has the Gita and Veda and Middle East has 1001 Nights, but that's about it (that I know of), and those aren't modern writing.",1
577,"Best Nonenglish Fantasy WorksLets talk about nonenglish works of fantasy/scifi(i meant the actual work is not written on english it doesnt matter the nationality of the author).

Admittedly i have mostly read english works(which means in my definition are stuff written and released in english first) but i came across some stuff originally written on another language(so any translated work counts so long it wasnt written on english).

 * **Roadside Picnic** (fairly interesting answer of fermi paradox and generally a story about the portrayal of the much more pessimistic side of humanity but has shown glimpse of light) which is a Russian Scifi work
 * **Kizumonogatari**, **Strike the Blood** and **Haruhi Suzumiya** which are all japanese light novels.
 * **La Passe-Mirior** which i am currently reading is apparently a french work (it has a pretty cool world with floating fragmented parts of the world which contains its own ecosystem and society and stuff.
 * **Witcher** ok i only played abit of the videogames and watched the tv series adaptation. But i heard it was Polish (just listing it down due to popularity)

What are the best you have across ? How do they differ from the usual english works ? How was their translated version ?

I am curious what are the popular works of fiction written in chinese, russian, korean, german, swedish, japanese, arabic etc etc etc (you name it !) 

Discuss. Thanks !",1
578,"Looking for recommendations for very gritty fantasy.I’m wanting fantasy that’s full of sex, drugs, and gratuitous violence. Crime themes are best but anything from court intrigue to high adventure works. The more NSFW the better as I want descriptive fights and sex. I want villains that are truly evil, I want monsters that are monstrous, I want immortal races that are depraved in their age, I want debauched nobles and decadent courts. I want cold hearted assassins, wizards thirsty and corrupt for power, ambitious politicians willing to do anything.",1
579,"I Just Read LOTS OF COOL BOOKS!! (Mini-Reviews Galore!!)Hey fantasy friends, did you know they make fantasy \*books\*? There's a bunch of them! Like, at least twelve, as far as I can tell! And me, I love books. They're my default hobby. The only time I'm not reading is when life has reached a fever pitch of nuts-ness... which actually describes the past eight months of my life pretty well. (Boy am I tired.) 

It's a new year though, and with it comes a new, wonderful phase of my life.... which means I have time to read again!! And for the past week, I have reveled in it! And since I have time, I thought it might be fun to shout at strangers about how cool these books were! :D

**The Reviews!** aka the part where I stop talking about myself so much.

**King's Dragon, by Kate Elliott** \--- Kate Elliott is a bad ass. (Let that be your first warning that I don't know what an ""objective review"" even is and I don't care to learn.) So much so that even this novella-lover was willing to pick up a 700-page beginning to a 7-book series. Fortunately, King's Dragon proved to be 100% worth it! What we've got here is a story (so far) split primarily between two perspectives: Alain, a foster child of mysterious origins, and Liath, a girl on the run with her scholarly father. Rest assured though, despite these humble beginnings, Elliott wastes no time in throwing these two into a war dead set on splitting nations in half... if even those nations survive that well!

Alain is probably the more ""standard"" protagonist and as such took most of the book to win me over. In another book, I'd have probably latched on faster! The ""problem"" is that Liath *FRIGGIN ROCKS, YOU GUYS!!* Her relationship with the magical lore of this world is suuuper fun to learn more about, and her story so far? Like, listen, let me give you the warning I wish someone had given me: the early half of this book has a pretty thick abuse narrative that made me run cold a few times. It's rough, and if that's not your bag, I get it! But (for me), where her character goes from there even within just this book was *so* worth it.

That's the biggest spoiler I'll give though. Beyond that, just get yourself ready for a deliberately paced, emotional journey that involves a VIKING SIEGE!! -- (Goodreads Rating - 5/5 Stars)

**Heir of Fire, by Sarah J. Maas** \--- You know what's *fun*? The *Throne of Glass* series. It's far from a ""deep"" series and if you have any preconceptions about YA fiction, you basically know exactly what these books are. No one's gonna judge you if you wanna just skip to the next review ...

Sike, we're totally gonna judge those nerds. What up, cool homies? You game for dragon riding vampire witches?? What if those dragons were covered in sharp, metal armor?? Cause goddamn, you *know* those vampire witches aren't gonna settle for some lame, regular firebreathing predator as their mode of transportation! Let me be clear: Manon Blackbeak (the vampire witch POV we get) is the coolest character in the entire Throne of Glass series and is in fact much cooler than most characters in most series. She's ripped right out of your Malazan fever dreams, I love her, and \*this\* is the book in the series (book 3, for those curious) where she's introduced. 

Unfortunately, *Heir of Fire* shows some growing pains as it really steps into its Epic Fantasy genre. I have no doubt that book 4 will be a blast! But this one lacked much of a story of its own. That's okay though, because it gives us Manon. (And a Broody Bad Boy, if that's your thing.) -- (Goodreads Rating - 3/5 Stars)

**Miranda in Milan, by Katharine Duckett** \--- Do you love Shakespeare? Do you love *The Tempest*? Then buy this book. Give it to your soul, because you deserve it. *Miranda in Milan* is a follow-up to Shakespeare's *The Tempest* that tells a story of what happened after Miranda and Prospero have returned to Milan. (I am aware that my synopsis is incredibly obvious if you've read the title and know what the play is about but come on I'm new to this.)

 It's beautiful and romantic and gay (in the sweetest way possible!), and best of all, it grapples with the work of Shakespeare in a way that I've needed since high school. It's seriously a novella *sounds* like Shakespeare, and I'm sure that if he were writing today, his work would be a lot like this. -- (Goodreads Rating - 5/5 Stars)

**Warcross, by Marie Lu** \--- If you've ever bagged on YA fiction and found people around you getting annoyed, it's probably because they've read Marie Lu. She rocks. Everything she writes sounds like some dope idea you wished someone would write but were too cowardly to write yourself. Marie Lu, however, is no coward. Warcross is a VR/ESports themed cyberpunk bounty hunting novel with spyish undertones and MAAAAAN.... it's good. I like it a whole dang lot. It hits that sweet spot for cyberpunk of ""futuristic and cool... but possible and that terrifies me.""

My only real gripe was that I play too many video games and the exchange rate of Warcross's fictional VR MMO currency to USD seemed like it might destroy a real world's economy. I get why the exchange rate was included though, so I got over it fast. -- (Goodreads Rating - 4/5 Stars)

**Annihilation, by Jeff VanderMeer** \--- I have no idea how to reconcile the weird, informal tone I've struck in this post with my Actual Thoughts about this book. If you're frustrated by the devastation of natural ecosystems, this book is something you want to check out. Briefly, Annihilation is about a team of scientists exploring an otherworldly natural phenomenon (known as Area X) in hopes of learning enough about it to stop it from growing and consuming the entire world. In this reader's opinion, it's fun to read humanity as an allegory for the natural world and Area X as an allegory for Civilization. Again, I have Thoughts that I'm still finding the words for, but that's why I don't do those fancy pants ""good"" reviews.

Also, I'd recommend reading this as an audiobook. At least, I wish I had! This book uses spooky ambiance well, and a voice would've made it all the better for me. -- (Goodreads Rating - 5/5 Stars)

**This is how You Lose the Time War, by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone** \--- GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY DO I LOVE THIS BOOK. I put it off for so long, expecting something dry and... time travel-y? Which, I guess the second thing is true. I mean, it's in the name. But it works, in a big part because the story doesn't require you to figure out the mechanics of said time travel. It is enough to know that there are two time travelling agents on opposite sides of a war, bumping around historical events, and leaving letters for each other. 

This book is essentially 200 pages of that feeling of when you make a new friend and discover how important they are to you. It's wonderful, I love it a lot, it's good for your soul, and alsoooooo............ things happen. Plot. STUFF. I'll leave that for you to discover! -- (Goodreads Rating - 5/5 Stars)

\---

WHEW, that was a lot of writing just for a handful of very imprecise reviews. ""Reviews"" lol. It's fun, however, to shout one's feelings about Good Books into the void, so unless anyone here is particularly opposed, I think I might continue dropping posts like these! Or I'll get distracted, who knows. THE FUTURE IS A MYSTERY AND ALL THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT BOOKS WILL KEEP BEING GOOD.",1
580,Just started reading Licanius Trilogy book 1 and completely invested and engrossed!I haven’t read a book this good in a long while. I plan on reading the entire trilogy but I read comparisons to another series called The Wheel of Time and was wondering if that one is worth reading as well?,1
581,"The War for the West, a ReviewAs a big ASOIAF fan, I've been really craving something like it recently - and since Martin isn't providing I've had to search in other places. A few days ago I downloaded an interactive novel called [The War for the West](https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/war-for-the-west/) so I would have something to read during a plane ride, and I was pleasantly surprised. You create your own custom lord or lady, making choices about how to run your lands and interact with the other nobles. Halfway through character creation, the game asks you to choose your house words, and it was at that point that I went, ""Wait, this seems familiar...""

Oh my god, guys, this novel couldn't be more clearly inspired by ASOIAF if there were a pair of incestuous twins in it (and there might be, I certainly haven't seen all the content yet). Everyone worships the Two instead of the Seven, and the land is being invaded by tentacle demons from beyond the Starry Veil instead of ice demons from beyond the Wall, and the troublesome culturally distinct separatists live in a marsh instead of a desert, but the spirit of feudal politics and clashing Great Houses (with a background of looming Lovecraftian dread) is carried through intact. I'm not saying it's a total ripoff or completely uncreative, just that it's in the same vein and as a fan of the books, I really appreciate it.

For those who are unfamiliar with these games: they are very simple to play, only requiring you to choose your character's next action from a list of choices. Like a choose-your-own-adventure book. Depending on your character's stats and previous choices, your set of available options will change. Some choices will kill you (e.g. if a rebel has you captured and you already pissed him off by shooting his commander in the previous battle, telling him to go fuck himself *will* make him slit your throat). However the game lets you load saves - or you can choose to end the playthrough there if you thought your end was fitting enough, a touch I find delightfully Martin-esque. The prose is definitely not up to the same level of quality, however that did not stop me from having fun.

Stop reading now if you want to go in completely unspoiled, but to give an example of what this game lets you do: My first character was ~~basically Princess Rhaena without a dragon~~ Margreth Redwyrm, the wrathful and blunt young Lady of Mandervale. Her House was not native to the Western Peninsula, but arrived in the area centuries ago from the south, fleeing the Cataclysm that destroyed the Old Empire. Over the course of one playthrough, she:

* Drove her poor husband to alcoholism as he realized that his lesbian wife was only interested in him for heirs and the alliance he anchored (thankfully he didn't murder anyone).
* Held her castle against an enemy army with a twofold numbers advantage until her father-in-law arrived with an army to save her bacon.
* Used skillful combinations of force, mercy, audacity, and appeals to ancient blood claims to size control of about two-fifths of the whole region. This put her in a prime position to get the other lords to vote for her as queen when they gathered for a Great Council.
* When said Great Council ended up deadlocked, one of the seemingly-unremarkable side characters casually revealed that he had already made plans to murder everyone there and declare himself king. His secret allies (including a woman Margreth was crushing on) then revealed themselves and started stabbing people. They asked for Margreth to surrender, apologetically saying that someone of her bloodline would be sovereign one day, but not her, and according to their interpretation of the prophecies this was the optimal way to defend humanity from the evil tentacle demons from outer space. Margreth told them to go fuck themselves and died fighting. 
* Left behind a young daughter, Natlya Redwyrm.

Long story short, I had a blast and I can't wait to try again!",1

583,"Help me find a fantasy writer.EDIT: Found it. Thank you u/serralinda73 

The writer I was looking for was Tanith Lee


So I deleted my reddit account a few months ago due to losing a bet, but just prior to that I was recommended a british fantasy writer that I reminded myself to check out once I had the time, because she seemed absolutely awesome.

Needless to say, I forgot her name.

**What I Remember:** She's British, and if I remember correctly she's resonably to pretty well-known there. Active as early as the 70's or 80's. The picture of her when I googled her gave me counter-culture vibes, like she played in an early goth-punk band like Bauhaus.

Her books had subversive intepretation of mythological and/or horror trobes.

I also think she dwelled in LGBT stories.


Does any of this ring a bell?",1

589,"The Complete Round-Up: Everything We Know about Amazon's LORD OF THE RINGS TV seriesAfter the success of my round-up post on Amazon's **Wheel of Time** show last month, I thought it might be worthwhile to do another one bringing everyone up to date on what's going on with Amazon's other huge fantasy epic, **The Lord of the Rings: The Second Age**.

**The Lord of the Rings: The Second Age** \- which may not be its final title - is a TV series set in J.R.R. Tolkien's signature fantasy setting of Middle-earth. It is a prequel to *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* and draws on material in Tolkien's other writings, most notably *The Silmarillion* and *Unfinished Tales*.

The series is being made by Amazon Studios, with New Line Cinema and their parent company Warner Brothers involved as producers.

The show is officially in production. A small amount of shooting was apparently undertaken in November 2019 to hit a development deadline (without which Amazon would have lost the rights). Full production is expected start next month in Auckland, New Zealand and run for two months. This will be followed by a pause as the studio prepares further scripts and material for the second season, after which production is expected to run for at least the rest of the year and likely into 2021, during which time most or all of two seasons will be shot.

According to comments from creative consultant Tom Shippey, Amazon are planning to shoot twenty episodes in total during the initial production bloc, which will likely consist of two ten-episode seasons.

The first season is likely to air in late 2021, with the second season to follow in 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

**Development**

Development of the project began in August 2017 when Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son and literary executor since 1973, resigned from the board of the Tolkien Estate. Christopher had long been opposed to authorising any TV or film adaptation of Tolkien's other Middle-earth material; the **Hobbit** and **Lord of the Rings** movie trilogies were made only because J.R.R. Tolkien had sold the film rights way back in 1969, before his passing. The other members of the Tolkien Estate, including two of Christopher's own sons (one of whom had worked on the Jackson movies) and his younger sister Priscilla (who had advised on Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film), were much more open to further collaborations with film-makers. In addition, the Tolkien Estate had several times had to take legal action to recover licence fees not paid properly from the films. With them being more closely involved in a new series, they could avoid this problem.

The Tolkien Estate themselves seems to have initiated discussions on the project, teaming with New Line Cinema (the subsidiary of Warner Brothers which had owned the **Lord of the Rings** movie rights since the late 1990s) to put together a package. This package appears to have consisted of certain time-limited rights to *Unfinished Tales* and some material from *The Silmarillion* (but not *The Silmarillion* as a whole, which the Estate considers to be a real goldmine for a future, much bigger collaboration). This deal was then shopped to at least three companies: HBO, Netflix and Amazon. HBO rejected the idea out of hand, as they remained committed to their **Game of Thrones** fantasy franchise. Netflix balked at the $250 million asking price for just the rights, reportedly counter-offering $100 million. When this was turned down, they decided not to proceed any further. However, Amazon, who had recently been ordered by Jeff Bezos to find ""their **Game of Thrones**"" was receptive and paid the fee up-front.

Amazon and the Tolkien Estate appear to have entered into a prolonged period of negotiation with the full deal not concluded until May 2018, although it was announced earlier (possibly to prevent any other companies from trying to jump on board and gazump Amazon, although this appears to have been unlikely).

It should be noted that the Tolkien Estate and New Line did not enter into any kind of agreement with MGM, who continue to own the film and TV rights to *The Hobbit*. New Line and MGM's collaboration on Peter Jackson's **Hobbit** movie trilogy had been tempestuous and reportedly the main reason for that trilogy's contentious filming and reception (including the decision to extend the adaptation from two standard-length films to three very long movies). Whether MGM was invited to the party and declined, or whether the Estate and New Line decided to simply not go there in the first place, is unclear. With the storyline of *The Hobbit* not expected to play any role in the new series, it may have been deemed unnecessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Content &amp; Story**

The content of the show remained a mystery for a long time, with rumours of a ""Young Aragorn"" series set between the **Hobbit** and **Lord of the Rings** trilogies circulating (mainly from The One Ring.net, a fansite that had made its name through its exhausting coverage of Jackson's original trilogy but has had a much spottier record with covering this new series). This appears to have been based on the ""interquel"" movie idea proposed by Peter Jackson and Guillermo Del Toro in the early 2010s, when to address MGM's demands for a trilogy they suggested a two-film adaptation of *The Hobbit* and a new movie focusing on Legolas, Aragorn and Gollum set between the two series. Significant development work was done on this idea before it was dropped. This led some fans to conclude that this existing material would make a starting point for the series.

This initial idea, which was not well-received by fans, was soon replaced by a much more promising one. The series would instead be set in the Second Age of Tolkien's legendarium, the time when the One Ring was forged, when Sauron first made war upon elves and men and when the world was dominated by the mighty island-empire of Numenor in the uttermost west. This idea also seems to have gained traction from the enormous success of *Middle-earth: Shadows of Mordor*, a 2014 video game which featured extensive flashbacks to this time period.

Despite almost a year passing since the confirmed Second Age setting, Amazon have not yet firmly confirmed the precise setting and background. The most likely starting place for the story would be circa the year 1600 of the Second Age, when Sauron, disguised as an elven prince named Annatar, makes alliance with Celebrimbor, Lord of Eregion, and works with him to create the Rings of Power. This leads Sauron to create the One Ruling Ring and unleashing his armies on the elves. The elves are almost defeated, but an alliance with Numenor swings the balance in the other direction. Sauron then resolves to destroy Numenor, helping first corrupt it and then tricking its rulers into bringing about their own downfall. This leads, many centuries later, into the War of the Last Alliance as seen in the opening to *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

To do this story justice, the TV show would have to be an anthology of sorts, leaping forward perhaps years or decades between episodes and centuries between seasons. The immortal elven characters, such as Elrond and Galadriel, could appear throughout the show's run, but the human cast will likely have to change on a regular basis.

&amp;#x200B;

**Budget &amp; Rights**

Amazon have already paid $250 million for the rights to make the series and have pledged a budget of no less than $10 million per episode and up to $15 million per episode. They have also provisionally agreed to a five-year run for the series (and have already renewed the show for a second season). This doesn't mean that the show will run five seasons regardless, even if it is a massive bomb, only that this is the current plan. If five ten-episode seasons are made at the maximum budget, then combined with the initial rights payment this will give a round figure of $1 billion, or almost twice what HBO paid to make eight seasons of **Game of Thrones**. This would comfortably make **The Second Age** the most expensive ongoing TV show ever made.

Because Warner Brothers and New Line are involved, the project has inherited their screen rights to *The Lord of the Rings* and its appendices in full, which is likely why the project has so far borne the title ""*The Lord of the Rings*"" despite being set long before that book. The use of the map of Numenor - a copyrighted part of *Unfinished Tales* \- on promotional material seems to confirm that the Tolkien Estate has also provided rights to that book. As well as the map, *Unfinished Tales* contains a detailed history of the Second Age and several short stories set during that time period, as well as extensive information about the goings-on of characters such as Galadriel and Elrond. One unknown is whether the Tolkien Estate has provided rights to *The Silmarillion*, as one large section of that book (""The Akallabeth"") focuses on the Downfall of Numenor and the arising of the more familiar kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor from its ashes. It would be hard to tell the story of the Second Age in full without access to that material.

Intriguingly, composer Brian Ralston [recently posted some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j4gadHZiig) from an audition for the role of composer which was rejected. This music includes nods to lyrics from *The Lost Road*, part of the **History of Middle-earth** series, which suggests that the deal may include material from those books as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Title**

The show's title has not been officially confirmed, with Amazon referring to it only as **The Lord of the Rings** or ""the **Lord of the Rings** TV series"". This is likely due to rights issues, confirming it is a spin-off from the existing TV licencing deal, and not related to the **Hobbit** movies.

The final title will likely be something along the lines of **The Lord of the Rings:** **The Second Age** or **The Rings of Power**.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Creative Team**

The showrunners of the series are **Patrick McKay** and **John D. Payne**. Payne &amp; McKay have built up some interest in Hollywood based on the quality of their early scripts, although their only produced script of note is that for the film *Star Trek Beyond* (2016), which was heavily revised prior to shooting. Notably, McKay and Payne had no showrunning or production experience before landing this job, which some has felt is an odd choice for what should be the most in-demand job in Hollywood.

The other writers include **Jason Cahill** (**NYPD Blue**, **The Sopranos**, **Fringe**, **Halt &amp; Catch Fire**), **Justin Doble** (**Stranger Things**, **Fringe**, **Into the Badlands**), **Stephany Folsom** (*Toy Story 4*), **Gennifer Hutchison** (**Better Call Saul**, **Breaking Bad**), **Glenise Mullins** (*Mine*, *Gray*) and **Helen Shang** (**13 Reasons Why**, **Hannibal**).

The show's creative writing consultant is **Bryan Cogman**, who wrote many of the best-received episodes of **Game of Thrones**. The other consultants are **Tom Shippey**, a respected Tolkien scholar for many decades (best-known for *The Road to Middle-earth*), and **John Howe**, one of the most respected Tolkien artists. Howe previously worked on the Jackson movies as a concept artist and art consultant.

The only confirmed director at the moment is **J.A. Bayona** (*A Monster Calls*, *The Ophanage*, **Penny Dreadful**, *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom*), who will direct the first two episodes of the series. **Mathew Dunne** and **David Waters** are currently reported to be assistant directors.

The other confirmed production team members are as follows:

* Production Designer: **Rick Henrichs**
* Art Direction: **John Dexter**
* Costumer Designer: **Kate Hawley**
* Production Manager: **Jared Connon**
* Concept Art: **Igor Knezevic**
* Storyboard Art: **Kur van der Basch**
* Visual Effects: **Dane Allan Smith**, **Jason Smith**, The Third Floor (company)

Many more key creatives are yet to be announced, including the musical side of things. It is also unclear if Weta Workshop/Digital are going to be involved in any capacity. Peter Jackson has reportedly talked to the new team and wished them well, but declined to be involved in an official capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Cast**

To date, almost all of the casting announcements for the show have come through secondary sources (such as agents and casting companies) with Amazon declining to confirm or deny anything. Many of these actors have also reportedly auditioned using codenames or fake names in the scripts to preserve secrecy, meaning we don't even know if this is who they'll really be playing. Still, the names announced so far are as follows:

* **Robert Aramayo** (**Game of Thrones**) as **Beldor**, the male lead
* **Markella Kavenagh** (**The Cry**, **Romper Stomper**) as **Tyra**, the female lead
* **Morfydd Clark** (**His Dark Materials**) as **Galadriel**, a younger version of the character played by Cate Blanchett
* **Joseph Mawle** (**Game of Thrones**, **Ripper**) as **Oren**, a villain
* **Maxim Baldry** (**Years and Years**, **Rome**)
* **Ema Horvath** (*Like.Share.Follow*)

For now, this is all the information we have on the project. Hopefully Amazon will release some more information once full production begins in a few weeks.",1
590,"My year in booksIt is a bit late, but I decided to also create a short post about the books I read in 2019 and how I would rate them. I personally enjoy reading such posts after all. 

**Note that I mostly value my personal enjoyment of the books.** 

**S-Tier/5 Stars (Amazing)**

* **A Wizard of Earthsea** by Ursula K. LeGuin
* **The Lord of the Rings** by J.R.R. Tolkien: I strongly considered putting this into A-Tier because I struggled getting through it. In the end however I think this was mostly due to me already knowing the story from the movies. Out of all the books I read this year it definitely stuck with me the longest even though I dislike how Tolkien seems to shy away from dramatic or emotional climaxes (e.g. Gandalf dies and just a couple pages later Gimli is all excited about showing Frodo some stone). 
* **Perdido Street Station** by China Miéville
* **Prince of Thorns** by Mark Lawrence: The main character just makes me think of the following thought you can have when commuting to work or school: ""What if I just don't go? What if I go somewhere else entirely? What if I just steal that car and drive off?"". He actually seems to live like that and it is interesting and exciting to see him figure out solutions through that attitude alone. 
* **The Last Wish** by Andrzej Sapkowski

**A-Tier/4 Stars (Really liked it overall)**

* **The Guns of Avalon** by Roger Zelazny (Chronicles of Amber #2)
* **Warbreaker** by Brandon Sanderson
* **Mort** by Terry Pratchett: I liked it well enough to give Discworld another shot but it did not live up to how hyped I was. Perhaps the humour was a bit too British for me (a Belgian). 
* **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang: A bit too edgy and YA-like in some places in my opinion. On the other hand it also subverted these expectations.
* **The Tiger and the Wolf** by Adrian Tchaikovsky: While I enjoyed the setting the plot felt a bit repetitive and long-winded at times. 
* **The Forgotten Beasts of Eld** by Patricia A. McKillip
* **Assassin's Apprentice** by Robin Hobb

**B-Tier/3 Stars (Liked it, but not sure if I would continue the series)**

* **The Name of the Wind** by Patrick Rothfuss: I actually kind of liked this book as long as it centered on what went on at the academy, but the completely pointless sidequest at the end left a bad taste in my mouth. Also funny how Kvothe keeps running into random money problems in order to keep the plot going. 
* **Blood Song** by Anthony Ryan: Very similar to The Name of the Wind in my opinion. I probably enjoyed it more overall, but it is not enough to bump it up a tier.
* **Nine Princes In Amber** by Roger Zelazny (Chronicles of Amber #1)

**C-Tier/2 Stars (Meh, kind of regret reading it)**

* **Empire of Silence** by Christopher Ruocchio: This is going to look weird coming from a 24 year-old but I think the author lacks the necessary wisdom/experience/maturity that comes with age to attempt a sci-fi series of this scale. It also blatantly rips off The Name of the Wind and A Song of Ice and Fire even if unintentional. The latter comparison may be not so clear but the main character's father really is basically Tywin Lannister, with a very similar backstory and lines to boot. To be fair though, the book may have suffered from it being the third 'Legendary character recounts his life story'-book I read this year. 
* **The Invisible Library** by Genevieve Cogman: I expected a whole array of unique worlds which the main characters would explore. Not worlds that were pretty much copies of Earth with some differences (e.g. Being Steampunk) and an overarching set of rules. Less imaginative as I hoped.",1
591,"Movie review: The House with a Clock in its Walls (2018) (spoilers hidden)*The House with a Clock in its Walls* (henceforce abbreviated *The House....*) is a 2018 movie directed by Eli Roth, based upon John Bellairs' 1973 children's horror novel of the same name. The movie, set in 1955, follows ten-year-old Lewis Barnavelt; after his parents die, Lewis moves in with his eccentric Uncle Jonathan. Lewis finds out that Jonathan, as well as his best friend Florence Zimmerman, are wizards and begins to study magic himself. As Lewis tries to navigate magical studies as well as his more mundane life as an unpopular kid at his new school, he finds out that evil wizards Isaac and Selena Izard have (as evil wizards are wont to do) set nefarious plans in motion using a mysterious clock hidden in Jonathan's house. Lewis, Jonathan, and Mrs. Zimmerman must try and figure out the Izard's plot before catastrophe strikes.

After watching this movie, I spent some time trying to figure out the right word to frame my thoughts about it, besides ""good"" or ""bad."" Words like ""good"" and ""bad"" certainly have their place in a review, but I knew by themselves they weren't enough; finally, I figured out the word I was looking for was ""faithful.""

Is the movie version of *The House....* a *faithful* adaptation of Bellairs' book? No, not really. While most of the general plot points are the same, the movie has a strikingly different tone than the book. The book--as well as Bellairs' writing in general--is typically described as ""Gothic horror,"" relatively slow-burn scary stories that have both a very dry wit and some rather dark imagery. (Lovecraft was one of Bellairs' influences.) The movie, on the other hand, is more of a fast-paced action-adventure fantasy film with scares more based upon the characters being in peril.

However, as an action-adventure fantasy movie, I think *The House....* works pretty well. It has good action scenes and good kid-friendly humor. I'm sure that the tone of the movie was influenced by the success of the Harry Potter films. The acting is good, and on a nuts-and-bolts level the film is put together well. Some of the changes to the story are really smart. *The House*.... is a *good* movie, but not a great one: the film feels rather over-complicated, particularly in terms of its pathos, and comes across as trying a little bit too hard.

Director Eli Roth is generally known for making adult ""torture porn"" horror films, like *Hostel* and *The Green Inferno*. These kind of movies are not known for their subtlety, and it makes sense that *The House*.... feels more like an action fantasy flick rather than possessing the wry creep factor of its inspiration. (A more faithful adaptation would require a director like Guillermo del Toro.) Sometimes this lack of subtlety works against the film--Roth can rarely let scary images just ""be"" but has to have characters comment on them, especially in jokey ways (the creepiest image in the film, involving large dolls, is drained of its fright factor because Jonathan has to say aloud, several times, how creepy it is). But there were also quite a number of moments where I appreciated the framing or the presentation of scenes a great deal.

The opening shot of the film, for example, shows Lewis holding a Magic 8-Ball, a Chekhov's gun that pays off later; in the book the Magic 8-Ball is important but comes somewhat out of nowhere. At one point Jonathan is training Lewis in a particular magical talent, which he later uses in the finale. In the book (spoilers for the ending), &gt;!the titular clock is described as just a ""plain, old, Waterbury eight-day clock"". In the film the clock turns out to be a massive, almost organically growing thing that, realistically, could never be hidden even in Jonathan's mansion; there's a subtle sense of distortion of space that is both ""magical"" but also somewhat unnerving!&lt;. Things like this are, maybe, basic cinematic techniques but they work and I appreciated that.

Some of the changes to the story also work really well. In the book Lewis accepts that Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmerman are wizards, but has only a vague interest in magic himself; in the film, when he learns his uncle can do magic his immediate response is, ""teach me!"" I can remember, even over thirty years ago when I first read *The House*...., thinking that Lewis' disinterest in learning magic was unrealistic and a tad frustrating. Also in the book, when Lewis asks why the Izards are doing evil magic, Jonathan gives a vague answer that essentially amounts to ""haters gonna hate."" The film gives the Izards a much more plausible and realistic motivation: &gt;!Isaac Izard, profoundly traumatized by what he saw in Europe as a soldier in World War 2, decides to build a doomsday clock that will wipe out humanity and make the Earth a peaceful place. Stock WW2 footage is used effectively. Kids will know ""war is bad"" and teens and adults, who know a little more about what happened during the war, can interpret just what kinds of horrors Izard may have witnessed there. !&lt;Izard is also given one of the more badass ""bad guy"" lines I've heard in recent memory: ""I taught you everything you know, Jonathan--I didn't teach you everything *I* know.""

Not all of the changes are equally as effective. In particular I found the movie was bogged down with pathos: every character had some sort of tragedy or trauma to deal with and I found it made the movie somewhat plodding, especially in the final act. Lewis, as we know from the outset, is dealing with the loss of his parents as well as trouble fitting in at school; this is from the book. The movie gives Jonathan his own family trauma and daddy issues, some of which he takes out on Lewis. Mrs. Zimmerman has her own family trauma--the death of her husband and child have turned her from a powerful witch into someone who can barely use magic at all. While ultimately there's a nice ""found family"" theme here, it's a little dreary, and boring, for a kid's adventure fantasy.

The actors all give good performances. Jack Black as Jonathan is quirky and energetic in a way that meshes well with the tone the movie is going far. Cate Blanchett is as good as she always is, as Mrs. Zimmerman. Owen Vaccaro plays Lewis, and while several times he's called upon to cry and he looks like he's forcing the tears from his eyes like squeezing Play Doh from, er, that Play Doh squeeze machine thing, he's a kid and he generally does a good job. Lewis's frenemy Tarby is played by a talented young actor, Sunny Suljic (he gave an excellent performance in *The Killing of a Sacred Deer*, which is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen). Kyle MacLachlan provides just the right amount of ham as Isaac Izard. Renée Elise Goldsberry (as Selena Izard), Colleen Camp (as Jonathan's neighbor Mrs. Hanchett) and Vanessa Anne Williams (as Rose Rita Pottinger) have less to do, but do it well.

The book *The House with a Clock in its Walls* was my gateway as a boy both to fantasy and to horror. It's still one of my favorite books; I adore it, along with all of Bellairs' writing. I would still love to see a more faithful adaptation of *The House....*, or any of Bellairs' other books (though this seems unlikely), but I appreciated Eli Roth's film interpretation all the same. I'm not sure how well it would hold up to multiple viewings (I have no special desire to watch it again), but if you enjoy kid-friendly fantasy action it's worth a rental.",1
592,"365 books in 365 days - or - the consumer of commodified fantasy2019 was a year that allowed me quite a bit of time for listening to audiobooks, so when I found that I'd already completed 25% of my Goodreads reading challenge by the end of January, I upped the challenge to 365 reads/listens by the end of December.

Why? Partly because I'm competitive in the wrong things entirely, and partly because I really enjoy reading and listening to spec fiction. Lastly, 2019 was going to be the year I would attempt to write my own story, and reading a lot should help me in writing my own work, right?

Now, I actually wrote this post on January 1st - and then didn't post it because it seemed a bit pointless. But then yesterday [u/takvertheseawitch](/user/takvertheseawitch) posted the words of Ursula Le Guin on commodified fantasy, and it seemed to me that my experience provided a counterpoint to the profit-driven production of mediocre goods to exploit the market, namely the mindless consumerism that undermines the effort involved in producing quality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with what is usually considered the primary consideration for any challenge; did I succeed? I did. My 2019-in-reading came in at 372 books totaling \~125k pages. Roughly 100 of these were re-reads already in my Audible library.

Was it fun? It was not. I can wholeheartedly say that this was one of the worst ideas I've ever had. And here's where my experience ties in with the creation of commodified fantasy that caters to business more than it does to readers. The experience reduced my appreciation of books that unquestionably were not commodified works to the level of an enjoyable tweet or blog post. When I was listening to books that were enthusiastically written and caringly narrated, I regularly appreciated not so much the plot, the prose or the characters, but the fact that I was 3 hours away from another notch on my read-list. With an hour left to go, I would already mark a book as read and rate it as an enjoyable three stars. No review, no rationale for my rating. Post it and move on. Such are the consequences of competitive reading. 

My authors found in me a commodified reader who, through audible or library, delivered them their royalties but otherwise trivialized their work and often forgot the fruits of their invention within a week after finishing it. I would neglect deserving books that were too long, or too challenging, in favor of a shorter read or a next-in-a-series-that-I-did-not particularly-enjoy-but-that-would-be-easy-to-process-since-I-already-knew-the-characters.

And, if I'm honest, I think I am not the only one. I doubt many readers will attempt 365 books a year, but there will be plenty who speed-read through a book during their train commute when they're still processing some bitter remark made at the coffee machine. Or those who blast through an audiobook at 2.4x speed when they're meal-prepping on a Sunday morning. There will be plenty who opt for book 15 in a series as a comfort read, even though the quality has objectively gone south after book three or so, and those who'd rather stick to authors they know and tolerate instead of risking an unknown book because they might actively dislike it. And once the book is completed, there will be a three- or four-star review on Goodreads or Amazon, and they'll move on to the next book. Commodified goods cater to this market, and if there weren't readers like me, those books wouldn't sell.

So this year, I set myself a new challenge: I will be the mindful reader that a book deserves, starting with some re-reads of books I did wrong last year. I will attempt a short justification of my rating for the books that warrant it (because let's be honest, Joanne Rowling doesn't need my favorable review on Amazon to convince others to pick up her works), and try to match my personal likes to recommendation requests that fit them. I will read new authors, I will read new genres. I will read Ursula K. Le Guin.",1

(It's free until Sunday, January 12, 2020, 11:59 PM PST)

It's a fairly quick read (just over 11k words) about a kid who can see the future, but I don't want to say too much more than that!

Here's the blurb:

**Jasken can see the future. His Dreams come true. But he’s not the only one.**

The Obscurate holds over a hundred dreamers. They watch over the Empire of the Seven Winds, guarding its future—protecting its citizens from murder and preventing dissidence against the emperor.

Jasken has accepted his duty, until he Dreams of someone he loves committing a crime. But how can he save them, when everyone around him can see the future too?

596,"Book Bingo Square: Personal Recommendation RequestOkay, I just realized I hadn't done a post like this yet so I could get my very important recommendations so I can meet the bingo square!! Yikes!

I like all different kinds of sub-genres of SFF (and really all genres of everything, but SFF is relevant here).  I'm a mood reader mostly so it's always hard to figure out what I'm going to say ""oh yeah baby"" to, but I'll try to give you an idea of what I like.  

**Things I am NOT looking for:** Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, any of the 'super popular we discuss over and over again' sorts because a) I'm already aware of them, b) I've probably read them, or c) I have no interest in them if I haven't done b.

**Some of my favourites:** Fairy tale retellings, well done urban fantasy, snarky protagonists, competent characters, lush prose, quick and witty prose, gritty settings.

Ugh, seriously it's just all too much to name -- I like well-written stuff but bounce off some things I'm surprised about. I loved finding new authors via TBRindr and got a bunch of new favourites from that too.

If you look up my posts, you'll see a fair few reviews if you need to get an idea of what I've rated well.

599,"You Should Read: A Nice Long WalkStarted a year and a half ago by the artist Jake Lawrence; A Nice Long Walk is an exercise in ongoing fiction in webcomic, using the format of four panel comic blocks to tell the story of a young girl on her very first adventure.

Our (thus far) unnamed protagonist is an aloof and audacious girl who's best trait is her ability to come up with quick solutions to problems, thought hey're usually the most brash possible. She is accompanied by an ongoing cast of characters, from loud goblins to alternative problem solving bugs.

It draws you in to its pink and cyan pastel fantasy world, a mood of the perfect type of morning, with adorable and solidly drawn characters that each bring their own humor to the writing of NLW. A sense of learning and discovery is kept as its primary protagonist, with each new fantastical location getting a shot of its glorious (yet simple) vista. As you wander its world, you'll feel the contented excitement that comes with meeting new characters and fumbling into humorously mundane danger. A comfortable ride from start to ongoing.

As of now there are 127 blocks (or pages, if you prefer), but it shouldn't take more than an hour or so to catch up. I can't recommend it enough

People try to kill her like five or six times in the space of about two days and she is fortuitously rescued by someone every single time. She never really manages to rescue herself or anyone else ever. This is kind of a pet peeve of mine so I’m wondering if anybody who has read the rest of the series can tell me if this gets better?

That was enough to get me interested and I will say, being almost done with Book two I am highly enjoying the story. I just have one nit-pick that I can't really recall having with another book. The writer ends a TON of stuff with adverbs like: Worriedly, Dazedly, Concernedly, etc... It happens so much that it sucks me out of the story every time I notice it now. Am I being crazy here? Has anyone else noticed this? Is this really common and I've just skimmed over other writers doing the same thing?   


I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from reading these books. As I said, I am very much enjoying the story thus far. Thoughts?",1

603,"[Review] BULB by Bradly WindThanks to u/bwind3 for providing a copy of his book.

I have mixed feelings about BULB. It felt like art that I wasn't able to relate to or like a nice meal at a restaurant that serves food from an ethnicity that I didn't have prior exposure to. Maybe I will relate to it later in life or after I try similar things. Regardless, it was well written and had some very good prose. 

There is a distinct surreal feeling that I got reading this book. Every time I picked it up and started reading, that feeling was there. The writing is consistent and evokes a feeling of watching a movie where the focus is on the B plot, so you know really important things are happening and have happened, but the context is missing and you only get a little that is A plot relevant. I always wanted to know more, but the book didn't go in that direction. I'm sure that was a hard choice for Mr Wind to make, as the world feels cohesive and real, and I'm sure he had a lot to say about it, but to make the point he was trying to make and to create the right feeling, those answers don't fit. Reading the book was an experience, and one I won't forget.

I have a hard time rating books like this. It was obviously good, just not something that I enjoyed. Give it a shot, maybe you'll like it!",1
604,"Which books are better as audiobooks?I do a mix of reading and listening to books, and I often think about which format to choose for a given book. Since my mind tends to wander more when I'm listening to an audiobook, as a general rule, I tend to read books that I anticipate being more invested in or that would require more focus (e.g. longer books, epic fantasy) and listen to books where I'm not as invested or am sampling a new author/style (e.g. shorter books, standalones, short story collections).

That said, sometimes the audio version of a book will have a really great narrator that enhances the entire experience. For instance, I've made a point to always seek out the audio versions of Abercrombie's First Law books, because Stephen Pacey does such an amazing job with the narration.

So I'm curious to know what books you would say are worth seeking out in audiobook form, where the narration really adds to the experience? Or conversely, are there books where you actively disliked the narration and would recommend avoiding the audiobook version?",1

607,"Commit to Combatting Commodified Consumerism!Reflecting on the thoughtful posts of u/JayPetersonWrites and u/takvertheseawitch , I thought it might be productive to have a discussion on what we as readers can do to improve things, rather than lament commoditization.  

The first thing that occurs to me is that, like so much in life (and I daresay in business), we like to measure things, but so often we measure the wrong things (usually what's easy to measure, over what's meaningful.)

Reading more is a worthy goal, but is the number of books the right way to measure ""more?"" As devil's advocate, would ""hours spent reading,"" be better or worse that ""books completed?""

But as difficult as spending time with thoughtful reading may be to measure directly, perhaps there are other ways of measuring it. Do you remember enough afterward to participate in a book discussion? Or to write a thoughtful review? Spending the time to thoroughly enjoy a book should lead to being able to discuss why we liked or disliked it in more depth. And perhaps if we were put such thoughts on paper, it would help us organize our thoughts, and be better able pick out novels we love in the future. And by sharing, we may help others as well.

I'm going to challenge myself to write at least three reviews this year: A book I love, a book I thought was ""meh,"" and a book I didn't personally like, but thought was well written.

Any other ideas how we might become more thoughtful consumers of that media we all love?",1

613,"Kings of Paradise - Book Review  

Kings of Paradise is an epic fantasy that grabs you from the very first page with a strong voice, intimate character portrayals, and unique worldbuilding choices. Despite its 600 page heft, it felt like a quick read that kept me up past my bedtime, and savagely set the hook for books two and three. 

Ruka is a deformed boy, a genius, and a pariah. He is an outsider in a harsh land ruled by a religious matriarchy. His story is entrancing, it lulls you with the rhythm of his life, his childish yet formidable intellect parsing together the strange circumstances of his woodland exile. His mother’s forlorn wisdom, at once recognizes the uniqueness of his mind, and his unassailable otherness, imparted by a grotesque birthmark, and an indomitable will that has no place in a brutal, simplistic culture. His story begins with a flashforward to Ruka’s brutal adolescence, and then rewinds to show his journey to the savagery that dominates his later life. Starting at this stage in Ruka’s development was a cunning narrative choice on the author’s part, which creates strong empathy for his plight, and informs the future choices of a character that might otherwise be difficult to identify with. 

Once we are thoroughly hooked by Ruka’s early years, the tale moves on to Kale and then Dala. Kale is a shiftless prince in an idyllic island paradise, and ultimately my favorite personality, the champion of an underdog crew, and ultimately the story’s main character. On the other hand, Dala is an aspiring priestess and a child of poverty. She is a loner, and a zealot. While I had a harder time liking her, she was never dull.  

Although there is a moment early on when Dala and Ruka’s stories intersect, for the most part all three storylines felt isolated from one another and didn’t intertwine very well for a lot of the book. It’s clear that they do in some ways connect, and that they will interact more profoundly in the remainder of the series, but the lack of interaction was one of the few detractions the book had for me. 

I found myself, about halfway through the novel, marveling at how well Nell’s voice satisfied the needs of the narrative. In many ways, even reinforcing the worldbuilding. Kings of Paradise is told with the artful simplicity of a fireside storyteller. Sentence structure and word choice stay in the background, allowing the characters and their stories to truly shine. The cadence of the prose was almost hypnotic, not in a flashy, overtly poetic sense, but in an understated way that kept pages flying by. The writing isn’t perfect. There were a couple of point of view slips, where I became unsure whose perspective I was seeing the story through. I also noted quite a few typos, particularly in the first third of the novel. But they were not so excessive as to ruin my enjoyment of the book. Without a doubt, Richard Nell has big league talent and the gift to bring stories to life with his words. Kings of Paradise brought to mind Ursula K. Leguin’s “A Wizard of Earthsea” and its simple declarative sentences that belied a master, evoking an elemental setting with a tale that begs to be read aloud.

The worldbuilding took some big risks which I think for the most part paid off. The setting has at least three major cultures with differing mythologies, mores, and civic institutions. The novel depicted a deeply flawed matriarchy through the eyes of a male character, without coming off as a misogynistic diatribe, which was a potential pitfall that Nell deftly avoided. It also begins in what feels like a very primitive, rustic setting, which paired with the author’s voice in a mesmerizing way. On the downside, at the end of the book there is a change of setting that vastly expands the scope of the world, and while it is convincingly articulated, I feel like this third act stepped out onto thin ice. It’s hard to say whether this is a change of venue issue, or whether the subsequent introduction of a last-minute antagonist, and conflict, is what threw things a little off kilter. 

Thus, the ending has some good and some bad that roughly balances out. The aforementioned switcheroo which puts one character in a new place, with a new supporting cast, and a new conflict, is a big detractor for me. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t wow me like the rest of the novel did. However, the conflicts for books two and three are really amped up by the other two thirds of the denouement. Despite one shaky leg, this was a satisfying conclusion on the whole.

Kings of Paradise is a flowing tale, full of rich characters, that you can love and hate in rapid succession. It is dark, intricate, and peppered with light handed philosophical insights. The author’s voice transports the reader from an iron age theocracy, to an island kingdom’s court, to a distant cosmopolitan capital, and spins them all together into a cohesive whole. This is a wonderfully engrossing book that will suck you in, a story that sets the groundwork for an epic, and yet deeply personal fantasy series.

616,"Help me figure out an obscure Mythos for a table-top game I'm playing!Recently I've been playing a table-top game known as [City of Mist](https://www.cityofmist.co/) in which your characters represent certain mythos. This could be anything from a historical figure to a mythological creature, anything. Current examples from our game are the Devil, Beowolf, Icarus, Cthulhu, Vlad the impaler, the list goes on and on.
A large part of this game revolves around discovering what a character's mythos is in order to determine their end goals, and I'm stuck on one.
The small amount of information I have looks like this:

* She used a door made out of chalk with arrows pointing to the handle that led to a completely grey room with computers in the corner.

* She has seemingly omnipotent control over technology. She was able to type remotely on a computer that did not have power.

* She is incredibly good at information gathering, often talking with her allies through an earpiece during fights and giving them insight into their opponent's weaknesses.

* Has the ability to implement false memories. These are often superficial and anyone with substantial power can shake it off pretty easy if pushed hard enough.
* May have the ability to change her appearance, and can likely shapeshift to look like different people

Keep in mind that the mythos doesn't have to be a person: it could be an object like Excalibur, a place like the garden of Eden, or anything in between. Its a very broad net, the only rule we were given is that it typically isn't something post WW1.
The Mythos generally aren't gender-specific either, my current best guess is the Boy who Cried Wolf, but it's not a perfect fit and I think the chalk door is a huge clue I'm not getting.

Let me know if you have any ideas! City of Mist is an awesome game, and if you're a fan of table-top games, ESPECIALLY ones focused on character development, definitely check it out.",1
617,"Para's Proper Reviews: My foray into Star Wars (Part 4: The Sequels)#Please be considerate and tag all your spoilers in discussion (\&gt;!spoiler!&lt; becomes &gt;!spoiler!&lt;)  

There was one thing I knew about the sequels going in: they are wildly divisive. While the originals are mostly revered and the prequels mostly reviled, the reactions to the sequels run to both extremes and everything in between even among the reasonable fans. That made me doubly curious. I have “done my duty” in watching the rest of the movies, but my history with Star Wars doesn’t go back even a month. I had no expectations except a strong suspicion that the dialogue will be better and the CGI finally unnoticeable. All I had was hope.  
  
Strap yourself in because this is going to be long. Really long.  
  
#The Force Awakens (2015)  
I fucking loved this one. From start to finish, it was one hell of an enjoyable ride and exactly the kind of excellent space cheese I’m in for.  
  
I know, it’s pure fanservice. Old characters and props feature heavily and in general, it builds on what came before rather than trying to do something radically new. Even the plot follows largely the same lines as *A New Hope*. This is as much a strength as it is a weakness. It plays things far too safe, recycles too much, and the more I think about it, the blander it is. But I’ll be damned if I didn’t squee with excitement every time I recognised something. I fell for it hook, line, and sinker.  
  
(Then there was a twist in the second half that I *absolutely did not see coming* and resulted in much yelling. Is that how it feels to watch a movie unspoiled?)  

But the real reason why I loved it so much is that it *improves* on the originals in many aspects (yeah yeah heresy I know). The dialogue, my biggest complaint with literally every one of them so far, was finally passable. No longer did I cringe every damn time certain characters opened their mouth. The battles were great even in the originals, but seeing everything done with proper, modern CGI was fantastic. And most of all, it’s no longer so awfully white and male (could it do even better? Sure. But when there’s an improvement, I’ll take it). For all the outcry, it’s nice seeing that everyone can have space adventures. And my headcanon that when you have a helmeted character, there could be *anything* under the bucket is pretty much confirmed and I love it.  
  
Plus, it helps that I really liked Finn and Rey. Rey is pretty much the new era equivalent of Luke or Anakin, so I was curious where will the story take her. And Finn is an ex-Stormtrooper! How damn cool is that? &gt;!I only wish they thought the whole ex-Stormtrooper aspect through and actually considered the implications. Had more Stormtroopers change sides. Maybe not have everyone (Finn included) kill Stormtroopers by the score – given that he showed so much compassion for his dead friend at the start, it makes no sense to humanise the faceless bad guys and then dehumanise them again.!&lt;  
  
As I said in my intro post, I watch Star Wars because it makes me feel less like shit. This one more than did the job.  

#The Last Jedi (2017)  
&gt; *Hope is like the sun. If you only believe it when you see it, you’ll never make it through the night.*  
  
Let’s get the bombshell out of the way first: Yes, *The Last Jedi* is, no shit, my favourite Star Wars movie of them all.  
  
If *The Force Awakens* played it a little too safe, *The Last Jedi* has balls. It takes risks. It attempts to be a breath of fresh air and defy expectations. And for me, it worked out *wonderfully*. Of all the movies, this is the one that never once broke my immersion. It was a joy to watch all around.  
  
The plot is more complex, with characters splitting up and several interweaving storylines, and for me it largely worked. Rather like a multi-POV book where you like each POV so much you’re not mad in the least when it switches. It’s far from perfect, there was some dodginess in the spaceship arc &gt;!everything hanging on the fleet running out of fuel is questionable given that Star Wars mostly avoids considering banalities, and I really didn’t like the second half of the casino subplot – part because the thief annoyed the shit out of me and part because the codebreaking part was all for nothing in the end!&lt; but Rey’s arc in this one &gt;!or shall I say, Luke’s!&lt; was beyond fantastic. I fucking *loved* what they did with &gt;!Luke. His grumpiness, bitterness, basically being a disillusioned old man makes for a far more interesting character than if he remained the hero he was. I never liked him much in the original trilogy and considered him alternately either irritatingly stupid because the plot demanded it or boring, but here he was my favourite by far. The deconstruction at the start and eventual reconstruction over the course of the movie as he found hope again, astonishingly good.!&lt; After all, it’s flaws and failures that make a character interesting.  
  
Characters and character development in general is what *The Last Jedi* excels at and another reason why I love it as much as I do. I’m a sucker for it, and here it was done beautifully.    
  
* First, everything under the massive spoiler tag above. This is perhaps the best one, and my favourite.    
* Poe: Slapped and demoted for recklessness that caused a loss of life the Resistance could not afford at the start of the movie, we see him eventually get over his hero complex. I was a huge fan of his interactions with &gt;!Holdo and Leia. Is Holdo an ass? Yes. But she has no reason to trust him and and Leia is not wrong about him needing to get his head out of the cockpit.!&lt; Do his flaws make him any less of a hero? Not in the least. If anything, they make him a better, more interesting character than if he was the standard action movie hero played straight and never challenged.  
* Finn: I also like the juxtaposition with Poe at the start: while Poe is a little too cocky, Finn lacks confidence and doesn’t really believe himself to be a hero despite people telling him otherwise, to the point of defeatism &gt;!and, almost, desertion.!&lt; Impostor syndrome. I saw someone mentioning that Finn learns why it’s worth fighting *for* things instead of just *against* and I think it’s a very good point. The casino subplot &gt;!may have ultimately ended in failure and been rendered pointless but!&lt; is hugely important for his character development.  
* Rose: A new character! Not quite as developed as the rest, mostly due to being new and all, but still gets her own arc going from a timid mechanic to a confident Resistance hero. From a side character to a main character. &gt;!It sort of combines the elements of Rey’s (broken pedestal, seeing the flaws in the people she looked up to), and Finn’s (gaining confidence), with the consequences of her backstory and having lost her sister in the initial bombing attack thrown into the mix.!&lt; Plus, she’s dorky and adorable and I love her.  
* Rey: Her hang-ups about being a nobody and searching for a place where she could belong are a far more traditional heroic arc, and not as interesting as most of the others, but still very satisfying. No real complaint from me.  
* Kylo Ren: Even the villain gets development, in a way! It’s been established in the previous movie that he is, in essence, an immature Vader fanboy prone to temper tantrums. Which is fun enough on its own. His central theme in this movie is &gt;!letting the past die. In many ways, this is similar to a standard heroic arc, and a mirror to Rey (which makes thematic sense, given their connection). He realises the old ways are flawed. And then comes to exactly the opposite conclusions than a hero would. Namely that everything must go down in flames. He comes to the precipice…and instead of turning back, consciously decides to jump off the cliff, turn to the dark side completely, deny the offer of redemption, and seize the power for himself. He wants belonging, like Rey, but doesn’t realise it cannot come from anger. That power will not help him.!&lt; This makes him one of my favourite villains ever. Far more interesting than the more standard “evil for the sake of evil.”  
* The only real character related complaint I have, aside from the thief being extremely annoying, is that Snoke is a very boring and ineffective villain, especially in comparison to Kylo Ren. Basically discount Voldemort.     
  
In addition, it really hammers home the point that Star Wars and space adventures are for everyone. Not just visually this time, not just in terms of characters, but as an actual strong theme throughout the story. Take, for example &gt;!Rey being a nobody from nowhere but getting to be a hero regardless, Finn with his background, Rose with hers, the little children in the end telling stories about Luke Skywalker and using the Force…all of that while those you’d think were born to be heroes – like Luke or Kylo – have failed in one way or another.!&lt; It’s not just about inherent destiny anymore, and flaws and fuckups are an inherent part of it all (*“Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery, hmm…but weakness, folly, failure also. Yes: failure, most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is.”*). And that’s powerful. Thematically, this is by far the strongest movie so far.  
  
And it all comes together into a coherent whole. The action scenes and the visuals are spectacular, it’s entertaining, it has humour (I loved &gt;![the evil ironing machine](https://i.imgur.com/jAt4cUK.mp4)!&lt; in particular), but it’s also backed by some iron-solid character work and themes that made the occasional slips of the plot easy to forgive. I’d put it in the “god tier” category right beside *The Mandalorian*. Nothing is perfect, but then, it doesn’t have to be.  
  
Also, it features the best explosion in all of Star Wars. I envy those who could see that in theatres. So there’s that too, I guess!  
  
#The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  
I went to the cinema with no small amount of trepidation. Getting into Star Wars right around the time when a new movie came out and I could see it on the big screen has been very lucky indeed, but at the same time, the opinions have been…mixed. Sure, it was unlikely to come close to *The Last Jedi*, but it could have at least been as enjoyable as *The Force Awakens*, right?  
  
When I saw the opening crawl, I made a face. My expectations fell significantly. What? They’re bringing back *what*? Why? How? Why now? How does this relate to any of it? What the fuck, what an ass pull! How could it break my suspension of disbelief *with the opening crawl?* The sequels aren’t supposed to be trainwrecks, that’s the prequels’ job! But okay. Maybe it will be okay. Two and a half hours to go, the premise is atrocious, but they might salvage it.  
  
It did not get any better from there.  
  
The most obvious issue with *The Rise of Skywalker* is that the plot is ridiculous. It’s an incoherent sequence of ass pulls loosely connected by a fetch quest and smoothed over by references and flashy action. It’s not that it isn’t what I expected, it’s that it makes *no fucking sense whatsoever*. Everything about it, every little aspect, every subplot, falls apart completely if you think about it for more than one second. It’s standing on foundations so shaky a breath could knock the whole thing over. “Hey,” it says often, “did you know that X is Y now?” Why? How? Fuck knows. “Oh, look, quick! Bad guys with blasters! Move along!”  
  
And it’s like this with everything, all the time. There is such a barrage of it that absolutely nothing is ever explained, not even with a throwaway line, even though there are not one but several things that seem so highly improbable even for a movie series about space wizards that treats physics as optional that they would, you know, *really need a decent fucking explanation*. I’ve complained about this when it comes to books before. The bigger the anomaly or inconsistence that’s completely at odds with what the audience knows is, the more effort do you need to put in to maintain the suspension of disbelief.  The lack of foreshadowing &gt;!with one exception: Luke’s X-Wing!&lt; and internal retcons don’t help. So much of what happens on screen didn’t ultimately seem to matter. Blink, next scene. Move along, move along!  
  
But okay. I didn’t have much of a problem with inconsistencies or ass pulls other Star Wars movies. After all, it wouldn’t be a Star Wars movie without at least one ass pull. Space wizards, whatever. So why the sudden urge to nitpick now? Why was I able to disregard the plot issues in all the other movies except the prequels, but not here? What’s so off that I’m suddenly focusing on plot points and believability? What’s bringing all my attention on it? I’m still not entirely sure. I think part of the answer could be the sheer quantity. I could take a few smaller, plot-convenient coincidences or ass pulls for the sake of dramatic tension, but in such large quantities…it’s not something you can *base a movie on*. It seems like there was no planning involved whatsoever.  
  
Or it could be in the execution. By which I mean, it probably is. For all I complained about the flaws of the prequels, at least they mostly had a strong, coherent plot thread. I could not argue with that. When you put it in bulletpoints, it’s a solid fucking story even if the execution sucks. And *The Last Jedi* made up for the occasional dodgy plot point with strong themes and characters.  
  
And this is an even bigger problem with *The Rise of Skywalker*: the character development, quiet scenes, emotion, or anything that’d provide a connection to the characters is utterly lacking for the sake of…faster, flashier pacing? The complex, careful character work the previous movie established? Yep, gone. Wasted. The characters are all flattened significantly. Dialogue is mostly exposition, conversations usually interrupted by action because fuck forbid we have a quiet moment, with the occasional scene with two characters (most often Ren and Rey) exchanging lines Very Dramatically. The dialogue, while not prequel-level bad, is noticably worse.  
  
This is such an issue because quiet scenes are the connective tissue that bind the story together. It’s what gives meaning to the action, the foundations, the essential contrast. Making a movie not boring is all about balance, you need *both*. Paradoxically, constant action and an abundance of…stuff do not equal good pacing or make a movie go by fast, sometimes you need a damn break too. Scenes that don’t directly advance the plot serve character development, and this is basic stuff.  
  
So much for bringing balance to the Force.  
  
Besides, it doesn’t *commit*. At at least three or four points, &gt;!something bad seemingly happens to a major character – except nope, a couple minutes later they’re shown to be totally fine.!&lt; Which utterly wrecks any sense of tension. I could take it once, but all the time? It’s pure narrative cowardice, an attempt to pull off emotional moments without really sacrificing anything. It doesn’t help that the characters aren’t given the time and space to emotionally react to those moments because plot must happen! Go, go, go! And if characters can’t, what chance does the viewer have?  
  
(Speaking of narrative cowardice, there was absolutely no reason for &gt;!Rose to play such a minor role.!&lt;)  
  
It then attempts to iron over the messy plot and lack of substance with action scenes and nostalgia. Now, I’m not at all immune to call-backs. I left my review of The Force Awakens as it was after I finished the movie. But cheap tricks don’t work when the core of the movie is as shoddy as this, they only highlight the larger flaws. Action without emotional connection is meaningless and boring as shit, no matter how much they attempt to speed up the pacing. Pretty visuals alone do not an interesting movie make. And throwing reference upon reference at the viewer when most of the references make no in-story sense is a little insulting.  
  
And is it even worth pointing out that it fucks up thematically as well? Is it any surprise after what I wrote above?  
  
It’s not even that it’s shallow, or that *The Last Jedi* raised my expectations too high. I wouldn’t have minded shallow. It’s space cheese. I went in expecting something in the vein of *The Force Awakens* or slightly worse – a bit of a rehash, mildly disappointing in comparison to *The Last Jedi*, but ultimately a fun ride regardless. But shoddy plot in combination with shoddy pacing *and* shoddy character work is killer. Not even &gt;!a red guard cameo!&lt; was able to save this mess. “Sit back and enjoy the explosions! It’s just a movie about space wizards for kids! Don’t overthink it!” Well, I can’t when its flaws are practically screaming in my face. It being action, it being a franchise made to sell toys – that doesn’t mean the movies cannot be good at the same time. And it just…how could they have screwed it up so bad? How did they manage to make it *boring*? Why did I spent the entire time either facepalming, sighing, or wondering when it will be over so I can go take a piss? Argh. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  
  
Hopefully the next movies and series will go back to being good again.  
  
#Verdict    
In the end, “wildly divisive” proved to be about right. My reactions were about even for all the movies in the original (fun, if flawed) and the prequel trilogies (varying degrees of shitty), but here they reached both the highest of highs with *The Last Jedi* and the lowest of lows with *The Rise of Skywalker*.  

If there’s one problem the sequel trilogy at large has, it’s a lack of coherent vision. I have said in my post on the prequels that the common issue with Star Wars is that while the big picture is solid, the details often aren’t. When it comes to the sequels, this is no longer true. *The Last Jedi* builds off *The Force Awakens*, no complaints about the first two movies, but it becomes obvious with *The Rise of Skywalker* that they didn’t plan the ending. At all. Many of the plot points from the previous movies are either ignored entirely or retconned, and it instead centers on an element &gt;!the sudden return of Palpatine!&lt; (which, hey, that’s a good movie title right there) that was not foreshadowed in any way whatsoever. It highlights a structural issue that goes deeper than just one movie, even disregarding all the other issues I ranted about. I bet a lot of fanfic endings are more canon-compliant and more of a logical conclusion based on what came before than this.

(By the way, if anyone knows of any fanfic that starts where *The Last Jedi* left off and constructs a better, canon-compliant ending, please float a link my way. Seriously. I beg you. Especially if &gt;!Finn and Poe!&lt; get to be a couple.)

Besides, being massively disappointed in at least one movie seems like an essential part of being a Star Wars fan, and I feel like I had my trial by fire now. My initial, knee-jerk reaction might have been “oh my god the last movie RUINED it” but after a private, indignant ranting session, I calmed down. One bad movie does not invalidate my love for the worldbuilding, or for everything that came before, or how much these movies helped me. And I refuse to let the disappointment turn into hate. I refuse to let it consume me. Prequels make it clear that you don’t have to like all the movies to consider yourself a fan, so why would this be any different?

I will not turn to the dark side.

This may be the last trilogy for now, but there are still *Rogue One* and *Solo* left for me to watch. At least one more post to come!

619,"Book Series for my wife and I to read togetherMy wife and I like to read together - we enjoy experiencing it together so we can talk about it while its fresh instead of having to wait for the other to catch up or finish. Lately we've been on a Brandon Sanderson kick. We read all 6 Mistborn books (we especially liked the Wax and Wayne arc), the Stormlight Archive books, Skyward, and now we're about to finish the Reckoners series. My wife seems to prefer books that aren't really long or heavy. I know, I know, I was surprised she was willing to tackle Stormlight, too, but she ended up really liking them. Even so, she's not eager to jump into anything really long. We also look for books without sexual content and little to no profanity and swearing and that aren't overtly dark or heavy. Some other series we have read together and both enjoyed are Fablehaven, Harry Potter, Maze Runner, and Pendragon. I think we tend to like stuff that's a little more on the fast paced side - she's not a big fan of slow world building in general. Anyway, we were hoping to get some recommendations of series or books that we might enjoy reading together. Thanks in advance!",1
620,"Charlotte Reads: The True Queen by Zen Cho *“I shall lay the path for you. There is no reason you should run into any trouble, provided you are sensible.”*

*“It sounds perfectly straightforward,” said Sakti, who had never been sensible in her life.”*

Here is a carry-over review from last year that I didn't get around to posting before the year ended. To conclude 2019, we are discussing Zen Cho’s *The True Queen*, her 2019 sequel to *Sorcerer to the Crown.* 

**So What’s It About? (from Goodreads)**

*“When sisters Muna and Sakti wake up on the peaceful beach of the island of Janda Baik, they can’t remember anything, except that they are bound as only sisters can be. They have been cursed by an unknown enchanter, and slowly Sakti starts to fade away. The only hope of saving her is to go to distant Britain, where the Sorceress Royal has established an academy to train women in magic.*

*If Muna is to save her sister, she must learn to navigate high society, and trick the English magicians into believing she is a magical prodigy. As she’s drawn into their intrigues, she must uncover the secrets of her past, and journey into a world with more magic than she had ever dreamed.”*

**What I Thought- The F Word**

Between this book, *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell* and *Sorcerer to the Crown*, I have absolutely loved every Regency-era fantasy I have read for this project. Zen Cho has the most delightful, charming writing style and this book was a delight. It features a clever puzzle of a plot, a witty, gentle sense of humor and the absolute sweetest relationships.

One of my favorite things about *Sorcerer to the Crown* was its meaningful analysis of oppression through the contrasting stories of Zacharias and Prunella each fighting for their place in society. I think there is a little bit less upfront analysis of oppression in *The True Queen,* and I have to say that I missed it. In exchange, though, there is an emphasis on the importance of relationships between women, from sisterhood to friendships to romances. I loved this, and I was especially a fan of the relationship between Muna and Henrietta.

Although I would have liked &gt;!their romance to be a little bit less understated, I think it received about the same amount of emphasis as the romance between Zacharias and Prunella in the first book, and I also think Cho did a good job of demonstrating the struggles that Muna and Henrietta faced knowing that they weren’t interested in men but unsure of how to articulate exactly what they do feel in a society that doesn’t even acknowledge that women like them exist. There are some great touches, from Henrietta idolizing the life of a spinster and Muna assuming that Henrietta loves Zacharias.!&lt;

&gt;!It turns out that heterosexuality is not hegemonic in  Fairy society, and Rollo and Damerell provide an inspiring example for Muna and Henrietta.!&lt; Rollo in particular is probably my favorite character in the series- he was so charming and hilarious! Prunella was also just as delightful as ever; I think Cho has quite a knack for writing these  women who are ambitious and clever and pretty much stone cold, and I think Sakti also joins these brilliant ranks.

Finally, although the book does not not necessarily spend as much time focusing on the intersections between colonialism, sexism and racism as the first book, there are still some very astute touches here. One great example is the double standard surrounding women performing magic in an Eastern and a Western context: the British condone the practice of magic in other British women, while they exoticize and romanticize the practice of magic in women of color from other parts of the world.

**About the Author**

Zen Cho was born in 1986 and grew up in Malaysia. She received a law degree from Cambridge University and currently lives in the UK, where she works as a lawyer. Her short story collection *Spirits Abroad* was published in 2014 and *Sorcerer to the Crown* followed in 2015.

623,"Morgan Watches the MCU: Ironman and Ironman 2Yes, I know, I run a book blog, not titled themoviewyrm, but I want to try something a little different anyway. I've actually not seen most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Shocking, I know. I'll hand in my nerd card. I've seen several of them; all of phase 1 and a handful of some of the later ones, but mostly I feel like I live under a rock where these movies are concerned. I've also started to hear a lot more critique about these movies and the messages they're sending, which actually makes me kind of curious to view them under a slightly more critical lens. Therefore I decided to watch all the ones available on streaming, in release order, and blog about my impressions.

This is going to contain explicit spoilers of all the movies so if you haven't seen them and want to do so unspoiled, here's your warning to click that little x in the corner of your browser window before it's too late.

Good? Good.

### Ironman

Out of the MCU movies I have seen already, I recall thinking the Ironman movies were the weakest, but I couldn't remember why. I actually used to like Ironman second most out of the original Avengers (Thor is fave) because I admired his snark (Tony Snark, amirite?), but found his original movies to be lackluster compared to Thor or Captain America.

Rewatching Ironman 1, though, I do think it was probably quite a fun movie back in its day. There were some shallow visual things that I liked. I enjoyed watching Tony iterate through designs of the Ironman suit, and was jealous of all his futuristic tech-gadgets and butler robot. Below surface-level campy fun, though, Ironman 1 really hasn't withstood the test of time.

Tony Stark, far from being the clever and witty character I remembered, is actually kind of an asshole. To be fair, at the beginning of the movie, he is supposed to be an asshole. He is arrogant, womanizing, and extremely cavalier about his inventions being used to slaughter nameless civilians in the Middle East. But despite undergoing considerable character growth in the first movie, Tony continues to be extremely self-absorbed and arrogant. I suppose this is realistic, but still a little disappointing.

A recent viral Twitter thread accused the MCU movies of glorifying war and the military, going so far as to blame them for current conflicts. I think blaming the MCU is going a little far, since the US, and humanity in general, have engaged in stupid pointless wars for far, far longer than Disney has been making superhero movies. But stories that glorify war irresponsibly are always worth taking a critical look at, lest we blindly accept their messages without thinking it through.

At first glance, Ironman's message seems to be adamantly *anti-*war. Tony Stark begins the movie as a shameless war profiteer, and this is painted as a Very Very Bad Thing. After undergoing a harrowing captivity behind enemy lines, he resolves to turn over a new leaf and stop manufacturing weapons, much to his business mentor's and shareholders' dismay.

This is all well and good, but I think it could have been presented a lot better. I feel like Disney *wanted* to explore the horrific consequences of war, but were afraid to do so in a way that wasn't safe, sanitized, and, well, Disneyfied. The only reason Tony is forced to confront his war profiteering at all is because he finds out that the *other* side has gotten ahold of his weapons and might potentially use them against Americans. That the US military might, too, put his weapons to dubious use, is never considered, and the implicit assumption that American war is fine because Americans are doing it is never questioned. 

In one scene, the terrorists who hold Tony captive at the beginning of the movie attack a small village for seemingly no reason. Tony, being the hero, has to swoop in in his Ironman suit and rescue the hapless villagers. This has a whiff of white saviorism to it, but also, maybe it was my imagination, but it sure seemed like the villagers, the ""good"" Middle Eastern people, had considerably paler skin than the browner-skinned ""bad"" Middle Eastern terrorists. Additionally, pretty much every Middle Eastern character with a speaking role was a one-dimensional stereotype.

I feel like this movie had real potential to tackle some really difficult moral quandaries, and it has this sort of feeling of almost, almost getting there, but then chickening out at the last moment.

This movie for the most part stands on its own without ties to the rest of the MCU. Until the end-credits scene where Nick Fury does his now-famous ""I'm putting a team together"" spiel, there is no indication that there is any wider universe of superheroes. We do meet Phil Coulson in this one, and there's a bit of a gag where he keeps spelling out the full SHIELD acronym and everyone makes fun of him for how much of a mouthful it is. But missing from this movie are the supernatural and futuristic tech of the later movies -- with the exception of the arc reactor, the bit of sci-fi tech that gives rise to the Ironman suit, there's nothing to say this movie couldn't happen in the plain old real world, 20 minutes in the future.

### The Incredible Hulk

Hey, I lied! I'm not watching all the Marvel movies! This one's not on streaming anywhere and Mark Ruffalo isn't in it so eh fuck it I'm skipping this one.

I did watch it a few years ago and I recall is that Arwen from Lord of the Rings is there and Hulk Smashes.

Moving on.

### Ironman 2

Ironman 2 brings us further into the MCU fold, with Nick Fury and Phil Coulson stopping in a little more frequently. There are a couple of references to either Thor or the Hulk movie that I didn't watch, when Nick says he needs to ""handle a situation in New Mexico."" We also meet Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow for the first time, in the guise of Tony's new assistant, since his faithful assistant and sometimes love-interest Pepper has been promoted to CEO.

Of the original phase 1 movies, I feel like Ironman 2 was probably the least memorable. All I remembered coming in is that Elon Musk does a cameo and there was a car race at one point which goes badly. However,  I actually liked this movie a lot more than the first one.

The movie begins with Stark seeming to live his best life. He is extremely popular saving the world as Ironman, the US is at peace for the first time in approximately ever, and of there are plenty of parties and booze and attractive women.

However, all is not well in Stark-land. The arc reactor Tony requires to keep him alive is slowly poisoning him. The government wants the access to his battle mech. His business rival, named, believe it or not, Hammer, would do anything to bring him down. And now, Ivan Vanko, son of his father's estranged business partner, has come along looking for revenge.

These central conflicts are what keep this story compelling, because unfortunately, most of the characters are kind of a drag. Tony does a lot of backsliding from his character development in the first movie, perhaps largely because he thinks he is dying and is out of fucks to give. The romance between Tony and Pepper was kind of irksome as well. In their interactions, she acts more like his mother than a partner, and he in turn is an entitled manchild in need of mothering. This does not the foundations of a healthy partnership make.

Then we have [this major douche.](https://i1.wp.com/www.thebookwyrm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Captain-Hammer-Doctor-Horrible-Nathan-Fillion.jpg?resize=201%2C300)

Wait, shit, wrong Hammer.

[This major douche.](https://i2.wp.com/www.thebookwyrm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hammer-ironman.jpg?resize=300%2C169)

Justin Hammer is not a terribly well-developed character. He seems to have been made for the sole purpose of being an over-the-top, ridiculous, major douche. And you know what, I'm okay with this. Sometimes it's fun to have an over-the-top sleezeball to root against. They probably could've turned the douchery down just a little and not lost any of the story, though.

The other vilain, Ivan Vanko, is actually the most compelling character in the movie. He is eccentric and loves his pet bird and doesn't put up with any of Douche Hammer's bullshit even when they're working together.

I do wish they'd leaned more into why his grievances were justified. Tony and Ivan's fathers were business partners who invented the arc reactor together. In the beginning it seems like maybe Howard Stark stole the arc reactor plans from Vanko Senior and got him deported back to Russia, which would give Ivan a plausible revenge motive and knock Stark Senior down from his vaunted pedestal, creating delicious delicious character drama.

Instead, however, Nick Fury gives some explanation that makes no gotdamn sense, about how Vanko wanted to use the arc reactor to get rich, so Stark had him deported. First of all I didn't know you could deport someone for wanting to get rich but I guess if you're Howard Stark you can do what you want. Second of all, ummm, still major dick move, Howard Stark. But the characters don't treat it like that. Instead, they just sit in Tony Stark's massive billionaire mansion going, ""Mmm, yes, getting rich, terrible goal, Vanko was a bad bad man.""

Like the first movie, I also thought the second movie leaned into the stereotypes quite a bit with regards to foreign villains. When we first meet Vanko he is carrying around a bottle of vodka in his slum as if to demonstrate ""Look, behold, how Russian I am."" 

Even though Howard Stark is on my shit list right now, I will say I teared up a bit at that moment when Tony watches the recording his father made for him, saying his greatest creation was Tony himself. Parenting hormones, people. Hell of a drug.

Overall I thought this movie was fun in a campy way, but like the first one, displays a certain, I almost want to say cowardice, in that it comes close to raising interesting moral questions but then skirts around them at the last moment.

Next up I'll be watching Thor. I'll probably just be ogling Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman the whole time, but I'll also try and review it too!

624,"Ursula K. Le Guin on ""Commodified fantasy""In the foreword to Tales From Earthsea (2001), she wrote:

&gt;We cherish the old stories for their changelessness. Arthur dreams eternally in Avalon. Bilbo can go ""there and back again,""and ""there"" is always the beloved familiar Shire. Don Quixote sets out forever to kill a windmill... So people turn to the realms of fantasy for stability, ancient truths, immutable simplicities.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And the mills of capitalism provide them. Supply meets demand. Fantasy becomes a commodity, an industry.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Commodified fantasy takes no risks: it invents nothing, but imitates and trivialises. It proceeds by depriving the old stories of their intellectual and ethical complexity, turning their action to violence, their actors to dolls, and their truth-telling to sentimental platitude. Heroes brandish their swords, lasers, wands, as mechanically as combine harvesters, reaping profits. Profoundly disturbing moral choices are sanitized, made cute, made safe. The passionately conceived ideas of the great storytellers are copied, stereotyped, reduced to toys, molded in bright-colored plastic, advertised, sold, broken, junked, replaceable, interchangeable. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What the commodifiers of fantasy count on and exploit is the insuperable imagination of the reader, child or adult, which gives even these dead things life--of a sort, for a while. 

To invite lists of the guilty would not make for a very nice thread, so instead I'll ask both for general thoughts and for fantasy that you think embodies the **opposite** of this description of commodified.",1

I don't want to read something truly horrifically bad, but I'm looking for recommendations on any interesting books that are fundamentally flawed.

630,"Ex-Isle (Conclusion of Ex-Heroes) by Peter Clines review 3.5/5http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1765-exisle

3.5/5

The Ex-Heroes novels by Peter Clines are one of the best high concept series out there. ""What would happen if the zombie apocalypse happened in a world with superheroes?"" I've also seen it described as ""Land of the Dead meets The Avengers"" and that's not a bad description. A bunch of low-powered heroes based loosely on popular archetypes are in the midst of the zombie apocalypse and do their best to save as many people as they can by creating a safe haven in a Los Angeles movie studio.

I've enjoyed all of the books and I'm in good company as Nathan Fillon has given them his recommendation too but the last volume, Ex-Purgatory, showed there was a bit of wheel spinning going around. Now that the superheroes have successfully secured their homeland, it doesn't appear there's much else to do. I also felt the relationships among the characters were rather stalled as we saw Saint George and Stealth get together a couple of books ago but what they're doing is left ambiguous. Likewise, I was surprised by some of the relationships mentioned in this book but mostly handwaved. Still, I was interested in seeing what Peter Clines would come up with.

Ex-Isle follows Zzzap finding an artificial island created from a dozen cruise ships and tankers fused together. Eager to get involved with another group of survivors, Saint George, Zzzap, and Corpse Girl journey there to make contact. Unfortunately, the locals are not only suspicious of outsiders but have a half-insane superhero ruler. Meanwhile, Cerberus is coping with PTSD even as she struggles to rebuild her armor. The Mount's survivors are opening a new farm for themselves so they can keep ahead of their rising population and it seems very likely someone may want to take it over as their own private kingdom.

This is pretty much a popcorn adventure in the grand scheme of things, making no big significant changes to the status quo and just introducing some more minor characters. I confess, I find this a little disappointing as I was hoping the introduction of Nautilus, basically the setting's Aquaman, would have resulted in another member of the team joining them. Unfortunately, Nautilus appears to be just another petty dictator and a foe for our heroes to face rather than a potential rival or ally.

I liked the depiction of the Islanders and their society as well as how everything functioned. Peter Clines has rectified some of the earlier accusations against him by expanding the diversity of the cast considerably. We also get an Arab superhuman named Marduk referenced who I initially hoped wiould make an appearance in future books. Alas, it turned out it is not to be.

The big stand-out of the book is Madelyne a.k.a Corpse Girl who gets a chance to shine in the book by showing off her regenerative powers as well as the tragedies of her condition. For those who don't remember, Corpse Girl can only remember the previous day clearly and facts beyond that. It's a bit like a less severe version of Memento. Watching her cope with a life and death situation without the help of the other heroes is very entertaining.

I also liked the handling of Cerberus. We've seen some great character development from her and there's some hints about her at the end which I really want to see followed up on. Cerberus is suffering from understandable trauma at having nearly been killed multiple times by Exes and confronting this issue without therapists is a tough one. I also liked the subversion of the ""evil military"" which is a prevalent trope in zombie fiction.

One area I'm going to complain about is the handling of Saint George and Stealth. After they hooked up in Ex-Communication, I was expecting some more information in how things are working out between them. Sadly, there's no hint as to what's going on there and it would have been nice to continue analyzing the differences between them. After all, it is a romance between the equivalents of Superman and Batman.

Unfortunately, we're never going to find out what happened to the characters beyond this point. Peter Clines has been quite clear that the sales for Ex-Heroes reached a point that it was no longer in the interests of the publisher to continue the series. It's a shame as there is so much more to do in the universe and I have become extremely fond of these characters. The hazards of traditional publishing.

In conclusion, this is a decent entry into the series but not a ""can't miss"" episode in their adventures. It's primarily notable for the fact that it is the last book in the series. The character development for some overlooked members of the team is appreciated as is the introduction of some new villains. Sadly, there's not enough attention paid to the series mainstays of Stealth and Saint George. I still recommend the Ex-Heroes series to anyone who loves both superheroes and zombie fiction as they're two great tastes which go great together. I just wish it had ended differently.",1

633,"The Lies of Locke Lamora not available on Audible in the US?Been trying for the past 30 minutes to get The Lies of Locke Lamora on Audible, but have hit nothing but roadblocks.

I've got the book and I know there are other avenues to get the audiobook, but I was specifically wanting to get it on Audible because I've got an available credit.

The closest I've come to downloading it is an alert that says ""Audible is not authorized to sell this title in your country/region."" The US is the last country I'd expect to have rights issues with a book as popular as this, written by an American author. I'd expect issues from a self published book or something written and originally published outside the US, but I don't see a reason why The Lies of Locke Lamora would not be available on Audible in the US.

636,"Intro to Xianxia, with Mini Reviews of Cradle, Immortal Swordslinger, Thousand Li, Darkening Skies, and Street CultivationA Brief Introduction to Xianxia (Originally Posted in [Fantasy-Faction](http://fantasy-faction.com/2019/an-introduction-to-xianxia-litrpgs-redheaded-stepsister))

The most widely read fantasy story in history is not George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, nor even JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. That honor belongs to Jin Yong’s Condor Trilogy, which fits into the Wuxia (pronounced ooo-shyah, loosely translated to Martial Knight-Errant) genre. If you’ve seen *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*, or old Shaw Brothers movies with the obligatory bamboo forest fight scene, then you know Wuxia is the Chinese equivalent of martial arts superheroes who live by a code of honor.

https://preview.redd.it/jkbmmmulf7941.png?width=233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b43eb8cbd783438a7b3b53602c469a3c9f84ac

Rooted in Daoism and embracing elements of Chinese medicine, a variant known as Xianxia (pronounced Shyann-shyah, literally Immortal Knight-Errant) has been around since the Monkey King’s adventures in *Journey to the West* (1592). Also known as Cultivation or Progression Fantasy, it has grown in popularity in recent years as web-novel popularity exploded in China. Told in chapter-by-chapter installments, these stories deal with cultivating one’s martial spirit and leveling up or advancing to reach immortality. Their pulpy plots reach hundreds of millions of readers. Some elements include:

* **Underdogs:** Who doesn’t love the guy who starts off near the bottom, and has to toil at practice, shedding blood, sweat, and tears?
* **Magic Pills/Elixirs:** Made with sacred herbs, these can help with fortifying or purifying meridians, recovering energy, and pushing advancement.
* **Demons &amp; Spirts:** Inhabiting these worlds are both benevolent and evil beings with supernatural powers.
* **Class Struggle:**  The protagonist’s foil is frequently the Rich Guy who was born into  privilege and can acquire the pills and elixirs that hurry advancement.
* **Tournaments:** What’s a martial arts story without competitions? Especially one that pits the Underdog against the Rich Guy.
* **Mysterious Bloodlines**: Lost heirs, reincarnations, what’s not to love?
* **Harem:**  Plenty of Xianxia stories have harem elements, so much that one could  argue many are self-insertion pulp stories for young men, where they get  to bed many beauties. Actually, this is rooted in Daoist principles, so  much that Chairman Mao Zedong supposedly went around China, sleeping  with virgins in a gold bed.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n80g7t0xf7941.png?width=230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976c68e1a76ee01582873b308a56226d8752ee43

Despite  their popularity abroad, Wuxia and Xianxia have drawn little interest  from traditional English-language presses. Aficionados were stuck  reading fun, but less-than-professional translations, which captured the  visual nature of the Chinese language with uneven levels of success. In  the end, some of the highest quality works are self-published original  English-language stories (Among them, Fantasy-Faction’s own GR Matthews [Wuxia stories](https://www.grmatthews.com/forbidden-list)).

Perhaps the most iconic of these English originals is Will Wight’s Cradle series. Though it might not be the oldest (Kassandra Lynn’s Book of Immortals series came out two years earlier, and Tinalynge’s Blue Phoenix three months earlier), it has probably introduced the Xianxia genre to more native-English speakers than any other. After reading *Unsouled*, book one of the Cradle series, I decided to take a mini tour of the landscape. Here are some mini reviews:

* **Cradle series:** I just finished binging through book seven, *Uncrowned*.  Will Wight has set the gold standard English-language Xianxia with a  compelling underdog, Lindon, and his quest to improve himself.  Imaginative worldbuilding is combined with an onion-like story, bound to  bring tears each time a layer is peeled off.
* **A Thousand Li series:**  Tao Wong’s story follows underdog Long Wu Ying. He comes from a small  village, though his family’s sword arts are well-renowned. It’s a *Mulan*\-like story, with training scenes and great camaraderie, but minus the cross-dressing.
* **Immortal Swordslinger series:**  Dante King’s portal fantasy features Ethan, a modern-day special op.  When he visits a Himalayan temple, he is thrown into a layered world of  elves, orcs, and martial skill. We learn about this new world through  Ethan’s modern-day, first person, snarky voice, which many readers will  find relatable. It has harem elements, though sex scenes aren’t awkward *Fifty Shades*\-esque, or hawt Blade and Rose style.
* ***Darkening Skies*****:**  With multiple points of view and world-impacting stakes, some  Cultivation readers consider eden Hudson’s work to be epic fantasy with  Xianxia characteristics. Maybe that’s why it was my favorite so far!  Like Cradle’s Lindon, Koida was born with a handicap that affects her  martial skills. She’s also something of a Disney Princess with a  recalcitrant animal sidekick. When she is betrothed to a barbarian  tribal leader, Raijin, all kinds of action and cultivation ensue.
* ***Street Cultivation*****:**  I’m only a quarter of the way into Sarah Lin’s novel, which takes place  in a grimdark corporate dystopia setting. It features Rick, a young man  from the wrong side of the tracks—if they still had tracks—who wants  nothing more than to protect his Lucrima (Qi)-handicapped sister. With  the modern technology, cell phone apps can gauge its users’ energy  levels.

As the genre grows in popularity, so are the variations. My Xianxia TBR now includes Rick Scott’s *Sundered Soul* (traditional Wuxia/Xianxia), Gage Lee’s *Hollow Core* (Sci-Xianxia), and Harmon Cooper’s *Way of the Immortals* (Western Setting Xianxia).

You can find out more about Xianxia on these Facebook discussion groups, where I got many of my recommendations, as well as material for this article:

637,"I Read 30 SFF Novels in 2019. Here are the Best (and the Worst)I'm not the most voracious reader, but I managed to read no less than 30 SFF titles this year and I have some thoughts. I decided that instead of giving my opinion of each title, I'll focus on the novels that made the greatest impression on me, good or bad. 

So without further ado, here are my awards for 2019:

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *Mary Anning* Award for *""How Is This Not a Bigger Deal?""* Goes to **The Memoirs of Lady Trent** by Marie Brennan


A Natural History of Dragons was a fun book, with a cute premise and some odd worldbuilding choices, but not much depth to it, so I can understand why it might have flown under people’s radars. But you’ll have to believe me when I tell you that series get so much better with subsequent books, ending up as one of the most imaginative, intriguing and enjoyable series the genre has to offer. In fact, The Tropic of Serpents is the best sequel I’ve ever seen in any genre, elevating every element from the first novel and showing just how much Brennan is a beast of a worldbuilder. 

So whether you’ve read  A Natural History of Dragons and thought it was just ok, or you’ve never heard of it, give the series a look. I think that you’ll be impressed.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *Jake Paul* Award for *“Why is This Popular?”* goes to **Swordspoint** by Ellen Kushner

Initially, this spot went to Willis's Blackout/All Clear, the Hugo-award winning dualogy that is about as enjoyable as *actually* living in London during the Blitz. But while Blackout/All Clear disappointed me more than any other book this year, I can still understand why those who loved it feel the way they do. Swordspoint, on the other hand, is just plain terrible. Terrible characters, banal setting, a side plot that goes nowhere and a main plot that's resolved with a twist that is about as surprising as the sun rising in the morning - I cannot fathom why this book routinely makes it to the top of best-of lists for fantasy of manners. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *“Chocolate, Amiright?”* Award for *Book Everybody Was Right About* goes to **The Goblin Emperor** by Katherine Addison

As the award suggests, you already know that The Goblin Emperor is good. You’ve heard others tell you it’s good countless times. So me telling you how great it probably won’t make a difference, but for what it’s worth – The Goblin Emperor is really great, and you should totally read it. 

I could go on about how the Maia is exactly the type of character we need more of in fantasy right now, or how clever it was to bombard the reader with overcomplicated proper nouns to mirror Maia’s confusion at the court with that of the reader trying to follow the story, and how all of that works way better than you’d ever expect – but there’s no need. Everyone was right about this one. You’ll see it too once you’ll read it. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *“Wait, so Tom Cruise is the Mummy Now?”* Award for *Worst Way to Start a Franchise* goes to **The Wizards of Once** by Cressida Cowell.

The Wizards of Once is by far the worst book I read in 2019. Derivative plot, horrible characters, Deus ex machina ending (with the laziest cliffhanger to boot) - it doesn't even have the decency to be entertainingly bad. You can tell the book coasts on the author's reputation from writing How to Train Your Dragon. You can also tell that it wants sooo badly to have its own animated movie because every scene is peppered with camera pans to some character doing something ""funny"" (if for some reason you decide to read this, I hope you find narcolepsy hilarious).

But the worst part is this: it's a children's book where nothing is learned. Bad and selfish behavior is rewarded, asshole character remains the same, the ending basically says ""well, back to square zero, better luck next time"". Who does something like that and expects you to come back for more?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *Million-Dollar Cotillion* Award for *Best Debut* goes to **The Rage of Dragons** by Evan Winter

I keep intending to do a full review of the Rage of Dragons, but it’s been pretty busy lately. So here is the tl;dr of such review: It’s so good ya’ll, so, so good. Yes, it has some debut novel issues, but every author should envy Winter’s ability to be this good on his very first novel. The pacing, the characters, the world, are all spot on. 

But The Rage of Dragons is not only well written, it’s got impeccable timing as well. With the fantasy genre finally opening up to more locals and time periods over the past decade, the African-inspired tale of Rage of Dragons hits the sweet spot of igniting the imagination while still being accessible to those unfamiliar with the cultures, languages, and myths of Africa. Simply put, The Rage of Dragons is an excellent book, and it came out at just the right time. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The *Song of the South* Award for *Aging Poorly* goes to **The Dispossessed** by Ursula K. LeGuin

It’s not rare to find that a speculative fiction book has some form of political statement. Such books always run the risk of coming off preachy, or that you might find the opinions within distasteful. The Dispossessed runs into a different problem: the theories it explores have been debunked by history, and no matter how complex is its world, it's all for nothing. Simply put, the ideas The Dispossessed exposits, while well-reasoned, are provingly wrong. What's worst, the plot is so tied up in the theory, that's there isn't much left that isn't tainted. I love that LeGuin thought so deeply about the worlds she created, but this is one book of hers I think needs to be retired. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


The *Sliding Down a Rainbow Into a Pool of Puppies* Award for *Most Fun You'll Have with a Book* goes to **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** by Andrew Rowe

There are many ways to decide which was of the books I’ve read this year was “the best”. I could make a convincing case for each of the books receiving positive awards in this post. So while I don’t know if it’s “the best”, I can tell you one thing - Sufficiently Advanced Magic is the book I can most easily recommend to anyone. If you like fantasy even a little, and you’re a human being, you’re going to love this book, and have fun each and every step of the way.

Or, to put it in other words: this is a book I wanted to be longer so that I could keep going and enjoy it. Rowe’s skill in writing action, coupled with a cast of characters you’re guaranteed to love, make reading this the most enjoyable experience I’ve had with a book since I was a kid reading Harry Potter with a flashlight under the covers. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

*Lifetime Achievement*: **Lud-in-the-Mist** by Hope Mirrlees 

Lud-in-the-Mist is one of the best books I’ve read, and I can’t recommend it to anyone. It’s obtuse, confusing and is filled with bad writing decisions. But as fans of Pandemic can tell you, sometimes bad ideas can come together to create an experience that is truly unique. In the process of untangling the slow pacing, difficult language, the constant tangents, and the obscure symbolism and trying to expose the meaning behind it all, something magical happened. I found myself engaging with this book on a level I’ve never encountered before, and discovered a feeling of familiarity with an author who is fiercely, fiercely intelligent and witty.

Those who are willing to put in the effort will find a book full of insights that will stick with you long after reading. But I can also understand those who would give up after reading a few chapters. This isn’t a book for everyone, but I feel like anyone should at least try and see it for themselves. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I hope you've found this insightful. Let me know if you've read any of the books I've mentioned, and your opinion of them.

638,"Trying to find a specific book series that I can't rememberI remember reading this book series in middle school? High school? (early 2000's). There was a human girl character who was raised by a tribe of centaurs, and she didn't realize she was a human until later. I don't think she was the main character, or she was part of a cast possibly.
She was captured, possibly on a ship, and somehow got free and kicked the lady in charge in the stomach. (Being raised by centaurs I guess any martial arts she learned was all with legs). She thought the lady was just fat but she actually was pregnant?? Then later in another book that kid is a character? I seem to remember her talking to that kid and explaining what she did in a different part of the book or a different book entirely.

Of course I often encounter heart-of-gold types hidden under a spiky exterior or jaded, world-weary sorts who eventually become kind...but  I can't find many that are deliberately kind even when they don't particularly want to be. 

I recently read *Nice Dragons Finish Last* and scarfed down the rest of the series. It really renewed my hunger for that kind of protagonist. I would so appreciate any recommendations!",1
642,"Is there romance in Brent Week's Lightbringers? Hey guys, I'll try to keep it brief. I love adventure books (typically fantasy or sci-fi or some mix) that have romantic elements/romance is a major plot point but it doesn't have to be explicitly a romance book full of sexual content (and I prefer male POVs due to being able to relate easier). I've enjoyed the Hunger Games and am slowly going through the Seven Realms series by Cinda Williams Chima which mostly hit these things. I tried the Night Angel series by Brent Weeks but accidentally spoiled myself a little bit somehow a while ago. I'm now looking at starting his **Lightbringer** series starting with Black Prism, but does it have a decently significant romance? The other series I'm looking at starting is the **Codex Alera** series by Jim Butcher which also seems to hit my criteria.

646,"Favourite SFF board game? (plus: spiel about Shadows of Brimstone)I can't recall seeing a post like this - no doubt there have been, but I haven't seen them at least in a long time, so figure why not.

For those of you who play board games (and I'm not talking things like Monopoly or Scrabble), what's your go-to, your favourite sci-fi/fantasy/horror board games to play with friends? Seeing as most examples people will give none of the rest of us will have heard of, maybe say briefly what they're about, and why you dig them so much!

&amp;#x200B;

If nobody mines me starting, mine is **Shadows of Brimstone** \- a very extensive Lovecraftian western horror game. You explore abandoned mines where portals have ripped open to other worlds (bringing dark denizens from them), and then cross into those strange worlds, fighting terrible monsters, roving gangs of aliens and bandits, demons and zombies and terrifying behemoths. All while keeping to your wild west credentials, fanning the hammer, chucking dynamite, and trying not to go completely fucking insane.

You can also go to frontier towns back home and buy loads of stuff and get into further dodgy situations (and avoid finding yourself kicking legs at the end of a noose). You keep your character between missions, and as well as levelling up you can also find yourself getting near-permanently injured in many specific ways (my gunslinger has had a crushed arm for about as long as I can remember), suffering from various debilitating madnesses (when was the last time I wasn't hallucinating?), and also getting mutated, often hilariously as well as hideously - my friend's Marshal character is practically a walking abomination by this point the amount of mutations he's got, but at least his intimidating tentacle moustache gets him cheaper prices in the stores! The best mutation he ever had, before he finally got it cured, was a second head - whenever he rolled a 6 to move he'd lose his go entirely, because the heads would be too busy bickering with each other (and of course I had to go find a Warhammer goblin head to blu-tack onto his miniature).

It's far from the most balanced or strategic game out there (I guess some would call it Ameritrash - a lot of dice rolling), but there is a LOT to it (if you're willing to spend the money that is - one of those games that starts out good but limited and gets better the more you get for it), and the theme is SO up my alley that I love it. I guess the theme will make or break it for a player. I've spent (or had spent on me, gifts wise) a mini fortune on it. God, including enemy/mission sets there must be like 80 expansions or something, including major ones/core sets which change the western aspect to Feudal Japan, Viking, and Conquistador (all with the Lovecraftian monster horror aspect). 

There's something very D&amp;D about the nature of the game, but with copious amounts of miniatures and tiles and cards (literally dozens of different decks), and more focused to specific themes. It's got that Warhammer nature to it too, as it's also a hobby game, and requires a lot of time spent gluing and painting models, which definitely isn't for everyone (and isn't always for me, admittedly).

I'm starting to sound like a shill by this point so I'll stop.

647,"SPFBO Finalist Review: Fortune's Fool by Angela BoordI'm a judge for one of the blogs for Mark Lawrence's SPFBO competition. In short, if you're not familiar, this is an indie-authored competition where 10 blogs go through 300 book, pick 10 finalists and 1 winner. This is one of my favorite from the competition so I thought I'd share my thoughts here. 

#  Review: 

I tend to favor character-focused stories over more plot-focused stories, from Pratchett to Becky Chambers, any book that makes me feel like I’m reading about real people will instantly go on my favorites list. I’m pretty stoked that this is the second time during the finals that I’ve been blown away by how attached I became to the characters. Both Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang and Fortune’s Fool have struck a chord with me and are in my top three favorites of the finalists.

This is a single POV story told in the first person using two different timelines.  We’re introduced to her in the ‘present’ but for the first half of the book, the majority of the page time is spent in her past bringing the reader up to speed on how she became to be the person she is now, and why she’s on this quest for vengeance. This book burns slow, but it’s a nice even burn. You’re not sure why at first, but she’s lost one of her arms and had it replaced with a magical metal arm, she’s been kicked out of her home and forbidden to use her last name. She’s disguised herself as a man in hopes that she can live out her life as a mercenary without being discovered by her House enemies. Despite the fact she can’t use her last name, or any of the privileges that came with it, she could still be killed for it.

For me, the writing was one of the highlights and strengths of Fortune’s Fool. I prefer books that are medium in length, between 300-500 pages typically hits the sweet spot. Shorter than that and I may not invest fully because there’s not enough time, and more than that often feels bloated and unnecessary. This is a 737 page and I feel like there could be things that could be cut or made more compact, there were times where it slowed down a bit too much. That said, I enjoyed myself a lot and can’t think of too many instances where I was thinking a scene needed to be cut. Most of what was in there either built up the plot/character and felt necessary. It’s a long-ass story. It’s a well edited long-ass story, too. Bloated books can take forever to edit and will sometimes have an abundance of errors, but I was pleased that wasn’t the case here.  The dialogue was very fluid and natural. I know I hit good dialogue when I’m engrossed in character’s back and forth and nothing sticks out to me as forced or “scripted” feeling. It’s a tough thing to do in such a long book with so much dialogue – many opportunities to make something feel awkward or out of place.

The world-building in this was intricate and leaned heavily on House rivalries over resources and trade. There weren’t many info dumps, everything unfurled naturally, there weren’t many instances of characters telling each other things they should already know for the sake of the reader. It was mostly show and not tell which made for an immersive read. It’s a low-magic low fantasy kind of book, too. In the very beginning, you’re told there’s magic, the main character has a magical metal arm – and yet, for the most part, it remains a mystery and isn’t seen on-page for a long time. It’s mysterious when it does appear, it’s not a hard magic system like some of the other finalists. The way Kyrra loses her arm is brutal, this is not a world where women are treated the same and sexuality can be demonized for the nobility. Losing your virginity very much so harms your ability to get married, and it can be twisted against the woman that she was a seductress and seduced the poor helpless nobleman.

The longer I sit on this book the more I like it. This is the opposite of what usually happens when I sit and think about a book. Normally I’ll find some plot hole or something that was predictable or doesn’t make sense. Maybe the ending made sense in the moment but when you take a minute to think about it later it doesn’t feel quite right. In this instance, I’m like “wow, I kind of want to read that again” to see what I missed the first time. I will absolutely be reading more from this author and will remember Kyrra and her story for a long time.

648,"The Hedgehog and the Fox*Longwinded rambling on the philosophy of fantasy writing ahead, fair warning!*  


There's a famous essay by the philosopher/historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin called The Hedgehog and the Fox. It's a bit of a long essay (though short for Berlin), but it essentially describes two primary types of thinkers: Foxes and Hedgehogs. It was inspired by a quote from the greek poet Archilochus: ""A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one important thing."" 

As Berlin lays it out, a hedgehog is a thinker who has a single, overpowering idea, through the lens of which they see the entire world. Examples he gives include Plato, Dante, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche. A fox, on the other hand, sees the world through the lenses of countless ideas, and simply can't reduce it to a single one. Examples given include Aristotle, Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin. Neither one is presented as better than the other, just different. (It would be somewhat insane to try and choose between the sides, especially the extended list he offers in the essay.)

It's important to note that hedgehog ideas are seldom simplistic, and many defy easy summation, though they're still identifiable as a single massive, overarching idea.

Of course, there are exceptions to the whole schema. Most notably poor Tolstoy, who Berlin explores at length, ultimately deciding that he's a fox who caused himself immense mental suffering by wanting to be a hedgehog.

This essay has been explored ad nauseum through the years, being applied in numerous pop business books (ugh, I hate pop business writing), works of philosophy and psychology, etc. It's remained one of the most enduring psychographic categorization systems, and people take it very seriously- much to the amusement of Berlin while he was still alive, since he'd always considered it just a bit of fun. Its popularity makes sense, though. It's intuitive, easy to use, and the fringe cases that don't fit in one category or another aren't overly damaging to the overall model- in fact, often strengthen it as the exceptions that prove the rule.

One place that I've only rarely seen it brought up is in modern fantasy literature, which is, of course, why I brought it up here.

The obvious and immediate figure to apply it to, of course, is Tolkien. Tolkien is one of the most obvious hedgehogs in the entire genre. Like many hedgehogs, it's challenging to sum up his ideas simply. (To paraphrase Ursula K. Le Guin, if she could have summed up the ideas behind her books quickly, she wouldn't have needed to write them in the first place.) We can, however, say that Tolkien believed that culture came from language, that the world he lived in was losing precious things to mechanization and modernization, and that England deserved a true mythology of its own. These all tied into his conception of ""secondary creation"", which we might call worldbuilding today. Considering the scale of Tolkien's work, and the philosophy tied into his idea, I think it's appropriate that we refer to secondary creation where he's concerned, not worldbuilding, when we talk about Tolkien. The strands clearly all tie together, however.

His contemporary and close friend, C.S. Lewis, at first glance, seems a hedgehog as well. His work seems to be a commentary on his Christian faith, and one of the most accessible Christian commentaries to non-Christians, at that. (Narnia rocks.) Given the sheer, disparate angles he approaches at ideas in his works, and the way he bounces around genre, literary format, etc, I think it's fair to accuse him of a status like Tolstoy- he's a fox that wants to be a hedgehog. (Though I'd happily accept arguments otherwise.)

(These two, I should note, are the only two fantasy authors I've personally seen fit into the schema before. Basically everyone agrees on Tolkein, less so on Lewis.)

Let's find a fox, then! And where better to go than my single favorite author, Terry Pratchett. Across Pratchett's works, you see explorations of faith, personhood, love, fatherhood, gender, politics, bureaucracy, time, childhood, history, alcoholic drinks mostly made of apples, tourism, war, etc. It's impossible to point to a single central theme in Pratchett's oeuvre. They're all recognizably Pratchett, of course, with that same humanistic bent, that same cynicism about crowds and love of individuals, that profound celebration of human absurdity and mundanity. But you can't point to a single idea that is fundamentally Pratchett's core. There's no central lens. Like Shakespeare, all the world fascinates him. 

Of course, you can also put this test to individual works, not just their authors. It's somewhat less productive when done for hedgehogs, but it's easier for foxes. (Small Gods is a hedgehog Pratchett novel, The Last Continent is a fox Pratchett novel.) It's overall not as useful for individual novels, though.  
So what's the purpose of this, beyond just doing it for fun?

...Do we really need one? Taxonomizing authors is exactly the sort of arbitrary categorization activity a lot of us nerds adore. It really is just so much fun. (And I fully expect lots of it to happen in the comments.)

...Fine, fine. There's actually a real purpose to all of this- the ongoing, perpetual debate about how it's best to think. This is why this psychographic schema is so successful- it points to a tangible, easily categorized way to divide thinkers. Do you find a single, defining idea to lead you through the intellectual maze of the modern world? Do you keep yourself light on your feet and adaptable? It's not just something that comes up in the political arena, like you might expect- you're just as likely to find foxes and hedgehogs battling it out in the halls of science or in Hollywood film studios. There will be hedgehogs complaining about frivolous, unfocused foxes. There will be foxes complaining about over-focused hedgehogs blind to anything outside their vision. They don't even need to be aware of the schema, and you'll still see them doing it, just lacking the name.

Here's the thing, though: That whole debate is bullshit. If there was a side that was clearly better, you'd see some sort of reasonable imbalance in the list of great minds they could claim, and you really don't in any sort of meaningful sense. They're both profoundly valuable modes of thinking. Great minds sure as hell don't think alike, and you wouldn't want them to. It's useful as a way to divide thinkers for the insight it give into them, not into some sort of debate about how to think.

Bringing it back into focus on fantasy, it's a way to really understand what an author is doing. Are they foxes joyfully exploring everything in the world around them that fascinates them, like Asimov? Are they hedgehogs trying to explore a powerful, even sublime idea, like Phillip K. Dick? (I think, that's a tough one.) Are they hedgehogs trying to convey their ideas to their audience, like Octavia Butler? 

(It's not just the great authors you can categorize thusly, of course- lesser authors are totally fair game. I'm most certainly a fox. I won't list anyone else as lesser authors, that would be rude, but you get the idea.)

Something about the fox/hedgehog divide allows you to really pry into an author, and ask serious questions about what, ultimately, their purpose as a writer was, what the deepest heart of their writing was. It'll only ever give you a chunk of the picture, but... that's all we ever really get, isn't it?

And for the love of every giant door stopper epic fantasy novel out there, can someone please, please tell me whether Ursula K. Le Guin is a fox or a hedgehog? I swear, every damn time I apply some new model to fantasy, or create some new formalistic metric to measure elements of worldbuilding, or whatever, she always manages to defy the damn thing. I adore her, but ughhhh.",1
649,"Criticism of Racism in ""The Tiger's Daughter"" by K Arsenault Rivera - Thoughts?For context, the book ""[The Tiger's Daughter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29760778-the-tiger-s-daughter)"" is the first in a series called ""Their Bright Ascendancy"" by K Arsenault Rivera. Its a silkroad-esque fantasy featuring a setting heavily inspired by Eastern cultures and stars a wlw couple as the main characters of the story. It's extremely refreshing to have a non-western setting featuring queer coded characters, and that's why I find myself liking the series a lot. (I haven't finished the third book yet so no spoilers in the comments please)  


However, I've read [some](https://ridethefrostback.tumblr.com/post/162145571082/in-reference-to-this-post-about-a-book-called-the) [criticism](https://vir-ghilani.tumblr.com/post/161871565208/the-tigers-daughter) of the first book alleging racism on the author's part. To summarise as best as I can, criticism of the book entails the author (intentionally or not) lazily mashing up her real life references/inspirations from Eastern cultures in order to fit the ""Eastern"" aesthetic of her universe. Examples include her use of the term ""rice-tongue"" - a real life slur - as a descriptor within the narrative context of the world, and her callous intermingling of Chinese and Japanese phrases in the worldbuilding for the Chinese and Japanese equivalent empires of her book, the Xianese and Hokkarans respectively. In addition, the fact that the author is not a Asian is not a good look with regards to the above criticisms, as it gives off the impression of an outsider looking in.   


Personally as an Asian person myself I didn't find the above aspects of the book problematic on my first read, although I still find myself agreeing with some of the points of the above criticisms. With regards to representation, I can certainly commend the series for its diverse setting and characters, but its mangled execution does leave a slightly sour taste in my mouth. Perhaps it's not good praxis to lambaste such an attempt at representation (as it might discourage other writers from doing the same in the future?) but at the same time I can't see myself wholly supporting this series in light of it more problematic aspects.  


Any thoughts?",1

&gt;**“And then the gods went mad. Not all at once. You’d hear stories of miracles out of the east, of new saints and monsters. Old ways getting swept away – but it was hard to tell what was incipient madness and what was the normal churn of events. I think the gods – our gods, in Severast – saw it first. That the sundering was an act of self-preservation. They tried to break themselves in two rather than remain part of an infected whole. Some of them didn’t manage it at all. Others did. There were two Lion Queens, for a little while. But the one from Ishmere was stronger, and without mercy.”**

The Shadow Saint is a devastatingly brilliant new installment in the Black Iron Legacy series by Gareth Hanrahan. Although the initial book, The Gutter Prayer, had a few weaknesses in the character development department, these were beautifully resolved and a complete nonissue in this sequel. Eladora is the primary focus of this novel, with Cari as a side character. Several new characters are also introduced: Alic, the spy, and Terevant, a man of Haith. As the Godswar closes in on Guerdon, the goals and aims of these three will align in unexpected ways. Fans of the worldbuilding from the previous novel won’t be disappointed; the expanded scope brings in a great deal of new information and helps fill in the cracks from the previous book. 

If it’s been a while since you last read The Gutter Prayer, the author has courteously uploaded a [quick refresher summarizing the most important plot points on his blog](https://garhanrahan.wordpress.com/2019/11/16/gutter-prayer-refresher/). I highly recommend it. [My review of The Gutter Prayer can be found ](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/12/18/the-gutter-prayer-by-gareth-hanrahan/)[here](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/12/18/the-gutter-prayer-by-gareth-hanrahan/), if you’re entirely new to the series. 

Eladora was a fan favorite from the first book, and I suspect many readers will be excited to know that she’s the main protagonist of the sequel. Although I had trouble connecting with her initially, I found myself engaged and drawn in to her new narrative. She struggles with her desire to help her city and the lingering fears and trauma from The Crisis. Thoughts of Miren haunt her dreams, and she feels the shadows watching her at every turn. She’s landed in Effro Kelkin’s political sphere, a man who formerly controlled Guerdon’s parliament. She is a political canvasser, specifically focused on The New City created by Spar’s sacrifice and The Gutter Miracle. 

&gt;Everyone else in Guerdon’s ruling elite sees the New City as a threat to public safety, a monstrous aberration that must be excised. Kelkin’s seen it for what it is – enough new votes to topple the balance of power in parliament. He hasn’t crashed his ship on the rocks. He’s beached it on a virgin shore.

The New City, however, has a vigilante saint lurking in its depths. The Saint of Knives is well-known amongst the populace, protecting the locals from criminal syndicates and foreign saints. To some, she’s a figure of shadows and fear. To Eladora…. She’s her cousin, Carillon. Cari has much less screen time in this sequel, but I was much more interested in her nevertheless. I felt cheated by Spar’s death in The Gutter Prayer, but as it turns out, he’s not entirely gone. Spar has been transfigured, stretched, and contorted into becoming a *part* of the New City, nearly godlike, with Carillon as his erstwhile saint. Together, they change the very landscape to suit their needs. Unlike the true gods, however, Spar is unable to regenerate himself with souls or though any other magical means. Each expenditure of power lessens his ability to interact with the New City, and Carillon struggles with doing what is needed when the price is her friend. 

Alic, or X84, or Sanhada Baradhin, or simply “the spy,” is perhaps the best embodiment of The Black Iron Legacy’s primary theme: change and transfiguration. Alic sheds identities like we should shed a coat. He lives in limbo, never fully committing to any one personality. Although he is, ostensibly, a spy for Ishmere, it quickly becomes apparent that his motivations are muddy and unclear at best. His loyalties are uncertain, but as he lives his Alic identity, he becomes more and more enmeshed into it until it’s difficult for him to know where Alic ends and the spy begins. His ward, a saint of Fate Spider, becomes important to Alic… and ultimately Alic begins to overcome and change the spy, in his own turn. 

&gt;Taking on the roles of refugees from the Godswar was easy for both of them. Walk like you’re hollow. Keep your voice low, as though speaking too loud might attract the attention of some mad deity. Shudder when the weather changes, when light breaks through the clouds, when certain noises are too loud, too charged with significance. Flinch at portents. The man whose name is not Sanhada Baradhin and the boy who didn’t have a name arrived on board the steamer a week ago with bowed heads, shuffling up the gangplank with a crowd of other survivors.

What we see of Ishmere, largely through Alic, is horrifying. Ishmere’s pantheon is currently set to win the Godswar; to the lion-headed goddess, Pesh, the Lion Queen, war is holy. War is endless, To conquer in war is her only purpose, and she will fulfill it at all costs. Every soul that dies on the battlefield goes to her, grows her, expands her. With support of the Kraken, Cloud Mother, and the rest of the pantheon… the Kept Gods of Guerdon, starved of soul-stuff and with only a handful of saints to their name, have little hope of defending their shores. 

&gt;The goddess Pesh, Lion Queen, war-goddess of the Ishmeric pantheon – or rather her avatar, made from Captain Isigi – purrs in satisfaction and settles back onto her seat. The spy notes without alarm that the simple wooden chair is now a throne of skulls, that the trestle table has become a blood-soaked altar. The hearts begin to beat again, squirting jets of crimson across the floor. The file folder, though, is still a file folder. Isigi – or is the overlapping entity in front of him more Pesh than Isigi now? – picks it up, extends a claw and slices through the metal seal holding it shut. The spy shudders at the grace of the movement, knowing that those selfsame claws recently tore a half-mile rent in the hillside below. Isigi removes the papers, reviews them in silence. The tent reverberates with her divine breath, which smells of meat and sandalwood. Everything comes down to this.

Through Terevant, brother to the Erevesic, we see a glimpse of the other side of the Godswar. Haith has been the primary opponent of Ishmere thus far, holding the front lines. Their god of death isn’t exactly present in the same way as Ishmere’s pantheon, but the undead Vigilant who hold front lines of the war are existence enough. In Ishmere, you’re no one one until you’re dead, after all. The great houses hold phylacteries, such as the Sword Erevesic, that allow, once again, a soul to be transfigured into a piece of a greater whole upon death. Terevant is still alive, and is very much hoping to remain that way. The political situation in Guerdon is fraught with danger for him, as his brother and his brother’s wife pull him in opposing directions. 

The biggest and most important change between The Shadow Saint and the Gutter prayer lies in the characters. Here, the characters feel less like they exist to support and a plot, and more like agents who *create* the plot as their actions and decisions impact the world around them. They all interweave beautifully, creating an intricate web of cause and effect that I felt was missing in the first book. The worldbuilding, which previously became a bit of an infodump at times, now happens organically through the knowledge and experiences of the characters. Terevant and Alic, in particular, showcase Guerdon from an outsider’s perspective. To them, The Crisis was distant history; they weren’t a part of it like Cari and Eladora. It’s a fresh, new perspective on the city as it currently exists vs the perspective of those who have lived through its most recent incarnation. 

I’ll confess, I was slightly hesitant when I picked up this book based on my experience with The Gutter Prayer; I was worried that it would drag, that the hefty page count would feel slow. Instead, I found myself anxious to pick up the book each time I had to set it down, constantly on the edge of my seat, and unable to wait to find out what the characters would do next. The final third of the book, in particular, had me curious and guessing. There was a small portion in the middle that felt a little slow, but it paid off in the end. Hanrahan’s growth as a writer is deeply impressive, and I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in The Black Iron Legacy.

Fantasy has always been my favourite genre, but I have read more middle grade/ya fantasy than anything else. Last year, I read the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, and I ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE. I have gotten to a point where I guess the plot and the plot twists of most of the books I read, but Mistborn was something else entirely. 

I already plan to read the rest of Brandon Sanderson’s books, so no need to recommend them.

I am looking for high fantasy with intricate plots and non-flat characters. Anything that made you fall in love with a series/author. 

Thank you in advance!",1

659,"What little things/“idiosyncrasies” do you have with fantasy books in general?I have two I can think of.....

1. I hate to start an unfinished series. I started the Wheel of Time series..... when the Dragon Reborn just came out 🤦🏻‍♂️. Prior to that, I’d finished the Belgariad and the Mallorian.... and had to wait on the last book. (I even have a shelf in my Goodreads account for book series that fall in the “Wheel of Time rule”)

2. I dislike books with LONG chapters. I’m stuck in The Fifth Season due to the chapter length. I’m starting to get bogged down in The Bloodbof Elves for this same reason.

Come on, share away. I can’t be the only one with such tendencies.",1
660,"r/Fantasy Writer of the Day: Jonathan PembrokeReddit Writer of the Day

Hey everyone! Jonathan Pembroke here, honored to be r/Fantasy’s Writer of the Day.

Lifelong fan of fantasy, starting when I was knee-high to an elf. I’ve been writing for almost fifteen years, though only in the last few years have I taken the plunge to get some things published. I really enjoy writing and telling stories and can’t see ever giving it up, even I never get rich or famous at it. Stephen King and Michael Moorcock were probably the most influential writers on my early development. I’ve had my writing style compared to Mark Lawrence’s and Richard Matheson’s. Obviously, each of those comparisons was just one soul’s opinion but I’ll admit, reading each made me smile.  

I (self) published my first book, *Pilgrimage to Skara*, in 2016. It’s a stand-alone quest story set in a far-future crumbling society, with some western elements thrown in. An aging Pathfinder—those who escort the chosen few on their journeys in search of special powers—is recruited to shepherd the daughter of the woman who jilted him years earlier. *Pilgrimage* was a finalist in the third Self-Published Fantasy Blog Off (SPFBO) in 2017, though the official reviewers had a low-hate relationship with it.  [Find on Amazon here.](https://www.amazon.com/Pilgrimage-Skara-Jonathan-Pembroke-ebook/dp/B01JB0ATU0)

My latest book, *Rumble in Woodhollow*, is the first in the series *The Holly Sisters,* and hit Amazon in Kindle/print format this last October.  It’s a fast-paced action-adventure style of read—or, at least that’s what I aimed for.  *Rumble* is about a young faery named Sydney who joins her sister Marla in the titular city of Woodhollow—a crowded, industrial, semi-slum of varied races—where Marla runs a criminal gang of faeries. The two sisters have to cope with mercenaries, peacekeepers, and a semi-immortal serpent ruler, all while rushing towards a confrontation with their arch-rivals, the Leprechaun Gang. So far the feedback has been decent and it feels like it’s a better book than *Pilgrimage.* Improvement!  [Find on Amazon here.](https://www.amazon.com/Rumble-Woodhollow-Holly-Sisters-Book-ebook/dp/B07XCB5TGH) 

The sequel to *Rumble* is due out in October of this year and is titled *The Mauler.* I hope to get the third book out towards the end of 2021 and wrap up the loose ends of the story. Initially, I didn’t plan to go past the trilogy but I am having so much fun writing about Sydney and her friends that I am sketching out the plot for a second trilogy with the same characters—or, at least the ones who survive!

After that? I have a 4-5 book series planned out about a teenage girl and her grandmother, who are royalty in exile, and harbor a terribly destructive power that is as much a threat to them as their enemies. The first two books are written and in draft status, so we’ll see what happens.

Let’s see, what else? I also write in another genre under a pen name. I read a lot. I’ve really started liking indy fantasy, and FB groups like Indy Fantasy Addicts and SPFBO (and here on r/Fantasy, of course) have been great for finding new authors.  I blog a little, though it’s more rambling BS than anything substantive, and try to read a bit on FB writing groups. I am, however, abysmal at even looking at my Twitter feed.

Apart from reading and writing, I play some video games; mostly single-player RPGs though I go through spurts of playing an MMO (Lord of the Rings Online). During the warm months I do a lot of work in my orchard and garden. In my former life, I spent twenty years in the American military as a meteorologist. I live in a small town in upstate Arizona. I’m married, I have one son who’s grown and out of the house, and also have an adorable red-headed granddaughter. If I have to choose between dogs and cats, I take dogs. Have three mutts and they’re a lot of fun.

Anyway, I love to talk about fantasy books (mine and others), games, and movies. I’d love to answer any questions you have about my works, my fantasy likes, or my sanity. If you want to provide some critique on my books, that’s fine too, even if you hated them.

So ask away!",1
661,"About to read my first Fantasy Book Ever (And first book in probably a decade)I'm making this post solely as motivation to not puss out. I was a pretty avid reader until my Senior year of HS, but I just stopped reading cold turkey. Ya know that feeling you get when a show you love ends and you feel like all of those characters you essentially became friends with have died? Well, I get that same feeling from books. And I hate it. There have been many shows that I love but have never finished because I can't face it actually ending. There have also been many shows that I want to watch but haven't, because I'm afraid of the journey. Like people who don't get pets because they don't want to have to deal with loving something and then it dying in 7 years. Same goes for me with books. They're a journey, and my pansy ass heart can't handle it.

I should say, though, I never stopped loving books. One of my favorite things to do over the last decade is watch ""Spoiler Reviews"" of Books I'm mildly interested in. That way I can know what happens without going on the journey. Seems stupid, but it's how i fill the void. I'm someone who hasn't read a book since probably 2012 and I can tell you about a good portion of the popular Fantasy and SciFi books that have come out in that time.

Now, what book have i chose to finally read? Well, only twice in the past 8 or so years have I read actual words of a book. I got on a Stephen King kick (The only person that can go on a SK kick without ever actually reading any of his books) and the only book of his I could find at the Good Will was the Dark Half. Read about a chapter or two. It wasn't bad or anything but it didn't grab me. I also read maybe 40 pages of another book that i can't remember the name of. But a woman wrote it and shockingly, the star QB was gay. All of the ""Female Authors writing Men"" tropes were present and I couldn't handle it anymore(i understand that lots of male authors can't write women, either. I'm not shitting on female authors). So I quit. In all of these years of watching reviews of books, the first one who's plot interested me so much that I actually didn't want to spoil it for myself and make a big boy decision to get back into reading?

The Way of Kings.

I basically just heard a synopsis of...I don't want to look his name up, but the slave. The bridge guy. And holy hell did it sound bad ass. If I'm gonna read a 1000 page book, i need myself a bad motherfucker to root for and I hope I found the one. I know there are like, levels to fantasy reading. And the Stormlight Archive might be a little too deep for someone to jump into the fantasy world with, but I'm a big boy. I think I can handle it. And I know all about all of the other big Fantasy Authors and Series. I've watched reviews on all of their works. Gaiman, Goodkind, Abecrombie, Jordan, Tolkien, and Martin. I know all of their bibliographies. Stormlight Archive just grabbed me. Heavy.

So, yeah. I think Brandon Sanderson is gonna get me back into reading. Which would be a life changing event. And now I feel pressure to actually do it because for some reason I made a post about it on Reddit.  Wish me luck, kids.",1
662,"eBook vendor alternativesHey all!   


Can anyone tell me of eBook vendors that are not Kobo or Amazon? I find many of the authors I want to read are only found on one of these sites and I'd prefer to give my money directly to the author (or at least their publisher) than put any more money in Bezos' pockets.

We might not have that one alien from alien with it's mouth inside it's mouth which is double redundant but whatever, but at least we have an entire species of reptilians and amphibians that fucking shoot out tongues at light speed to catch any and all flies within a one meter radius, and a lizard that fucking runs on water because JESUS.

We might not have electric mouses but we do have spiders that use fucking electricity to fly over the goddamn ocean because why the fuck not, just look it up, they actually do that and it fills you with a sense of dread that the spider revolution is coming.

We might not have giant Leviathans and see monsters, or.. sin?? Whatever the fuck sin is from that one final fantasy game I've never finished but we have giant mammals called whales and dolphins that used to be on land, and were.. originally in water, and then they went back to the water after evolving legs?? I-its a mess but they're called whales and they like to shoot water out of their brains and do neat water flipping tricks which is amazing especially considering their fucking size. 

We might not have zombies but we have a fucking virus that is super goddamn deadly and can possibly be programmed to kill other viruses and evil bacteria, and also there are viruses that literally, instead of turning cells into virus sacks, will turn humans into virus sacks and make them want to get help aka population centers with hospitals making them a deadly fucking time bomb but I forgot what it's called but I know we read about it in highschool last year, and I believe it came from africa or some shit. Dang why do so many dangerous things come from africa?

But seriously like, this world is fucking amazing but I'm sick of people who love this genre going ""ugh there are no dragons this place is boring"" LIKE WHAT??? WE HAVE ACID BREATHING LIZARDS AND FLYING SQUIRRELS, ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!

672,"Always thought Neil Gaiman was overrated... then I binge read all 75 issues of The SandmanI snootily ignored the entire medium of graphic novels for most of my life. Then I got interested after seeing all the beautiful artwork displayed at my local Comic Con. The obvious place to start was Gaiman's Sandman, often touted as the best of the best. So, despite the fact that I've read or attempted to read most of Gaiman's books without being impressed (with the exception of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, that one was gorgeous), I jumped in.

Holy. Shit.

The Sandman follows the story of Dream of the Endless, the prince of dreams, a powerful, aloof character somewhat reminiscent of Bowie's Goblin King in Labyrinth. The storyline is surrealist and non-linear, with some truly trippy art. There are stories within stories within stories here; characters tell stories, and characters *within* those stories tell stories. Some are dreamy and fairytale-like, some gritty and violent and realistic. It's never really clear which stories are ""real"" and which are ""just"" stories.

Does it get confusing? Yes, it's confusing as hell, but in the best possible way. 

The characters feel so incredibly real. There's a huge cast of characters, humans and gods and animals and historical figures from all manner of different worlds, mythologies, and timelines. Yet no character is extraneous. That random side character you encountered in Issue #3? Probably going to pop up at some point and prove to be important after all. 

It was an absolute masterpiece of fantasy storytelling. I actually found myself choking up at certain points in the series. Finally, I get what everyone sees in Gaiman's work. Maybe his novels don't do it for me, but anyone capable of writing The Sandman has got to have some kind of creative genius. 

So, bottom line: if you're not a comic book fan, if you're not a Gaiman fan, read Sandman anyway.",1
673,"Charlotte Reads: The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison&amp;#x200B;

*""'We consider it cruel,' Maia said. 'And we do not think that cruelty is ever just.'""*

Welcome to my first review of 2020! Today's book is Katherine Addison's *The Goblin Emperor.* Spoilers follow (marked), and a mention of abuse.

**So What's It About? (from Goodreads)**

*""The youngest, half-goblin son of the Emperor has lived his entire life in exile, distant from the Imperial Court and the deadly intrigue that suffuses it. But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an ""accident,"" he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir.*  
*Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an attempt on his life at any moment.*  
*Surrounded by sycophants eager to curry favor with the naïve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while, he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend . . . and hoping for the possibility of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest he lose his throne–or his life.""*

**What I Thought**

Anyone who knows me well knows that I have a dragon's hoard of Elf Boys That I Would Die For. After the first few pages of this book, I was already entirely certain that Maia was going to join the ranks  - he is simply one of the most precious, wonderful characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about. There are few characters that I can unabashedly say that I love, and he is now one of them. He is a sweet, kind person who is determined to be good to others around him, and over the course of the novel he overcomes his shyness and insecurity, coming into his own and learning how to better exist in a demanding new world. I loved seeing him grow in capability and self-confidence, and I think the fundamental message is that goodness is ultimately rewarded with goodness in kind, that his unpretentious, genuine way of relating with others around him does truly make a difference. It's an incredibly comforting, cathartic, hopeful thing to read.

I loved seeing characters gradually come to look past the title of Emperor to come to know Maia for who he truly is and begin to care for him for the wonderful person he is, and it helps that all of the other characters are just as well-written and interesting, from Setheris to Cala and Celehar. The relationship with Setheris is especially interesting, as the formerly abusive guardian figure is suddenly at the utter mercy of the boy that he tormented and despised for years. Not going to lie, this particular aspect of the story is also incredibly cathartic, and I really understood Maia's choice  to put aside the temptation of revenge, instead arranging circumstances in order to simply be free from Setheris's influence over his life.

The setting is beautifully realized, opulent and fascinating, but herein lies my main struggle with *The Goblin Emperor:* the sheer number of incredibly difficult elf names to remember, from courtiers to government members, parts of the world and parts of the government. There is a glossary in the back that was really helpful, and the rest I usually managed to figure out using context clues. Is it just me, or am I getting better and better at understanding complex fantasy world-building, or at least going with the flow when I have no idea what's happening?

The Steampunk setting is an interesting one, and I have to say that it stands out among the crowd of Steampunk that I've previously read because it manages to make the world all its own while looking past the cool asethetics to get to the heart of what makes the Victorian/industrial setting so fascinating and ripe for exploration: the social tumult and instability and the rapid changes leading to tension and uncertainty. To talk a little more about that, it's time for the next section!

**The F Word**

Part of what makes me love Maia as much as I do is the fact that he is so acutely aware of and empathetic about the plight of people who do not have power in society or are treated as lesser-than, having known this from his own experiences before becoming emperor. This shows in his relationship with his sister Vedero - he refuses to force her into marriage, instead encouraging her to continue in her pursuit of astronomy. The women in this book are all women who fight to find a place for themselves in a patriarchal world, from his fiancee Ceredin who swordfights and speaks her mind to Vedero and her scholar friends determined to find a place for women outside marriage and motherhood, the woman who was overlooked for the honor of becoming his personal guard until Maia chooses her and the opera singer who tries to use Maia's crush on her to get him to learn about her sister's plans for a bridge. Maia respects and understands them in a way that his father did not.

The last thing that I want to discuss in this section is the group of people &gt;!behind the bombing that leads to Maia's reign - the best way I can describe them is as elf communists. I would have loved to see this bit of world-building developed in more detail, and it would have been interesting to learn about the experiences of other progressives who do not turn to terrorism to pursue their goals. Maia has a really interesting conversation with the man who developed the plan - he felt that radical action was the only solution to the oppression that people faced under the previous emperor, and that the deaths he caused were worth it just for the fact that they put Maia in charge, as someone who is an outsider and has already brought change to the position of emperor. I would have liked this plot to be fleshed out more, and to have further addressed the inherent flaws of a system that places so much power into the hands of one man, chosen for his blood instead of his capabilities.!&lt;

**About the Author**

675,"[Spoilers Licanius] So, I've just finished Licanius and fall into the camp of people who think it's the best thing ever. Any recommendations where to go next?EDIT: I'm talking about the Licanius Trilogy by James Islington, which starts with Volume 1: The Shadow of What Was Lost

'The best thing ever' is a slight overstatement of course, but I enjoyed it more than a lot of books I've read lately, probably the most since I've read Wheel of Time (which is probably still my favourite series after all these years).  

What I liked most about the trilogy was, structure-wise:   
the dense plot, the twists and turns that all seemed to come naturally and fit together and rarely felt forced, new revelations every other chapter


What I liked most story-wise:  
A group of old mysterious, seemingly all powerful people in the background of the world (the Venerate), the well-executed time travel, the (IMO) supremely well done grey morality - not a lot of people felt truly villanous, and not many people felt truly heroic, no matter which side they were on. (I'm also a big sucker for people willing to talk to each other and hear each other out and at least seeming reasonable, which these books delivered on a ton)

What I didn't particularly care for:  
The overarching tropes, while well executed, feel a bit used up, what with the suppressed gifted, the big wall and the evil Dark One Bent On Destroying The World For No Particular Reason. Shammaeloth was built up really interestingly and I was a bit disappointed for it to turn into a big, shadowy mass of evil at the end regardless.  

Do you have any recommendations for books that I might like based on what I've written above? :) One of the most important aspects to me is the twists &amp; turns &amp; revelations, preferably with a lot of 'old history' of the world to discover. 

I've read most of the big fantasy series that are often mentioned on the sub (excluding Malazan).",1

683,"Realism isn't real. History and fantasy.Spurred on by the debate on 'realism' in the 'homophobia in fantasy' thread, I decided to write about how 'realism' isn't really real, and how the veneer of historical truth is often utilized to justifying the continuation of modern-day bigotry into wholly created fictions, instead of, even, reflecting how bigotry worked and why it existed in historical settings. We can see this in a couple ways: just copy-and-pasting bigoted attitudes from the present into the past for, I don't know, 'grit', exclusion of people who 'wouldn't have existed', assuming the mores of the upper class was the mores of everyone (or even depicting the peasantry of a mass of regressive attitudes and nothing else), and general lack of research and actual knowledge in actual history, and just going by 'common knowledge'.

But first, I'd like to dissect what realism means the context of fantasy and how it, fundamentally, can't actually reflect real history because of a couple reasons. To start, as anyone who has done historical or anthropological work knows, our actual knowledge of history is full of holes, often holes the size of centuries and continents and entire classes of people, and there is a couple reasons for this. The biggest one is often the lack of a historical record--written reports (and as a subset of this, a lack of a historical record that isn't through the viewpoint of relatively privileged people--those who can read and write), and I would say the next biggest one, in relationship to archaeology, is often the utter lack of cultural context to make sense of the artifacts or written record. So when people say they want 'realism' or are writing 'realistically' do they mean that the presenting a created past that, at the very least, pays attention to amount we simply don't know, and is being honest in the things they create? Often no, they are using the veneer of 'historical truth', which is often far more complex and incomplete than they are willing to admit, to justify certain creative choices as both 'correct' and inevitable. Its incredibly dishonest and ignorant. If we don't know our past in any kind of firm-footed way how can invented created works claim to be a reflection of that?

Second, I often see people who claim realism also seem to reject, or omit historical records that don't meet their preconceived understanding of history, and often a very idealist understanding of history (as in ideas being the main driver of history, not a positive outlook of humanity). Lets look at racism--a big sticking point of people who like 'realism' in fantasy. Racism as we understanding doesn't *exist* per-scientific revolution, or per-understanding of humanity as a biological organism, at the very least, because racism, at its very base and conception, is a scientific creation that views different types of people as biologically inferior, and often in the historical context, and as justification of colonialism. Recreating racism, as we understand it in a per-modern setting is incredibly ahistorical, and yet...it happens in the name of realism (or is, at least, hypothetically defended in the name of 'realism'). This doesn't mean ethnic bigotry didn't exist, it did, it just didn't exist in the same way. Romans were huge cultural chauvinists, but you'd could be black or white or German or Latin and still be Roman--it was a cultural disposition and familial history that was important, not genetics or biology (same for a great number of other groups).

Lastly I'd like to look at the flattening of historical attitudes towards gender, race, class, and sexuality into one blob that constitutes 'history' and thus 'realism', because it happens a lot in these discussions. 'Of course everyone in the past hated gay people', which is an incredibly broad and generalized statement, and ahistorical. Different cultures at different times had different attitudes towards homosexuality, and many made cultural room for the difference in human sexuality, and many didn't, both of which are real in the same sense. Beyond that we can also consider personal, of individual opinion, which we often lack access to, and assume that this, as it does now, varied a lot of the ground. Painting the past in a single colour with a single brush is often the first and biggest mistake people make when taking about history.

Note, throughout this all I did not mention elves or dragons or magic because fantasy is about, fundamentally, creation, and imagination. People who like fantasy have an easy time accepting dragons and real gods and wizards who shoot fireballs, partially because of tradition, and partially because we want to. So I think when people have a hard time believing in a society that accepts gay people (which existed), or view women as equal to men (which existed), or was multicultural (which existed), or some other thing, and then claim realism as the defense of that disbelief I think they should be rightfully called out. Its a subversion of the point of fantasy, and its absolute abuse of the historical record to, largely boring ends.",1

685,"Fantasy books that focus more on architecture or building things than fightingHello everyone. Right now I'm looking for a fairly unique fantasy book that puts a lot more emphasis on architecture, buildings, structural support, exploring stone, etc. than combat.

I suspect the Gormenghast series will be like this to some extent and I'm very excited to read it. Is the Books of Babel series like this too? Ostensively it's about the Tower of Babel, but I'm not too sure if the author cares about the architecture of the tower and its various parts more than making each new place unique and strange. I haven't read it yet though; it might be what I'm looking for.

688,"Book without a traditional plot... does this exist?OK, so I've wished for this for a long time. Today I was thinking, what if it exists? I tried Googling, but it's far too specific to be able to formulate into search terms. 

In fantasy books, I've always enjoyed reading about the supernatural elements, the deep hidden mysteries, etc. more than the big good vs evil plot of the book, or whatever the challenge is. Sorry to use such a basic example, but for instance, in Harry Potter, I was always most interested in the parts where they were just learning about magic and finding out what they could do with it. This wasn't just gravy to keep me interested in the main plot, it was the main focus for me. The actual battles and such are kind of just a distraction for me.

I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but really, what I'd love to read is a book where the protagonist(s) just do cool stuff the entire time, without really having to deal with any big challenge, any significant event, any quest, etc. Basically, kind of like a drone song that does away with traditional verse/chorus structure and just plays a killer riff over and over with subtle variations.

689,"The Wheel of Time is sexist and that is ruining my enjoyment of the seriesI’ve been reading WoT lately (I’m currently at the beginning of book 5) but I’ve come across a pattern that I’ve found so disturbing that I’m considering quitting the series. It doesn’t just have sexist characters/cultures (which also bother me) but is, itself, sexist. I’m looking for motivation to continue, proof that it gets better, and to feel more justified being as uncomfortable as I am with the sexism. I know it’s written in the 90s but I’m reading it now so just because there was casual sexism in fantasy then is no excuse and I’m not looking for anyone to try to excuse it.

These are some sexist things that have bothered me.

Robert Jordan said himself that he had a no male nudity rule [see link ctrl f for nudity](https://www.theoryland.com/intvsresults.php?kw=female+dragon), which often is shown through the excessive use of exclusively female nudity. I’ll quickly highlight many of the times this rule has come into play throughout the books. 1) naked women ritual to become Accepted Aes Sedai 2) naked women ritual to get into Rhuidean 3) Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene all spontaneously losing their clothes in Tel’aran’rhiod 4) Aiel sweat tents which have exclusively featured women on screen 5) Rand’s MULTIPLE dreams featuring him and his love interests naked in a pool of water.

I have no issues with nudity. However, the fact that it is exclusively women getting naked, makes it sexist and/or fan service which I find highly uncomfortable.

It’s not just the nudity but the thoughts of the characters that demonstrate sexism seeping from our world.

When Nynaeve and Elayne are in Tel’aran’rhiod and their clothes turn into what amounts to lingerie they both think “I wonder what Lan/Rand would think of me like this”\*blushes furiously\* By doing this they are sexualizing themselves. It’s their POV chapter and yet there is an overlayed male gaze. This would be fine if the men also thought like this but they don’t. The closest comparison is Perrin keeping his beard because Faile likes it, but it’s not the same thing. Perrin never puts on a pair of pants and thinks to himself that he hopes Faile likes his ass in them.

I already mentioned it but Rand’s sex dreams featuring all his love interests (and Lanfear and Egwene once if I’m remembering correctly) standing around naked and silent, ready for a foursome shows objectification of women. There is no equivalent shown in female thoughts. The closest we get is with Nynaeve’s ter’angreal dream where she marries Lan and has his babies or Egwene’s where she marries Rand and has his babies. The thoughts of both the women and the men are shown to be limited here. I’d have no issue with Rand’s sex dream if Egwene had one with Galad and Gawyn. I’d have no issue with Nynaeve dreaming of having Lan’s babies if Rand dreamed of babies he wanted.

Has the clearly present sexism also bothered you? What have you done to get over this? Does it get better while Jordan is still writing it (I know it will be better when Sanderson takes over &lt;3)? Spoilers that you think will help are welcome.

EDIT: One thing I don't think I made clear was that **my post is about some of the writing of WoT being sexist not the in-book sexism**. Clearly throughout the entire thing the women are sexist to the men and act accordingly and the reverse is also true. So demonstrating the in-book sexism that happens later on, while interesting, doesn't make me wrong.",1
690,"Witchmark by CL Polk - reviewI read this for HEA bookclub, but then managed to miss the end of month discussion thread, probably because I was busy eating. 

I know nothing of romance books, but [Witchmark by CL Polk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36187110-witchmark) was the HEA bookclub pic for december on r/fantasy, and I’d heard only good things about it, so I went in. I was expecting a nice chill love story between two men, maybe some sort of fantasy of manners. I was not prepared for the wild ride this book had in store for me. Yes there was a love story and it was very sweet and I liked it, but oh boy was there a lot of story beyond that, and it got seriously dark. 

It starts off pretty slow and chill, with Miles Singer working at a mental hospital. He’s a very good man by the way, he’s so compassionate and kind, a sort of Hawkeye Pierce but with magic instead of sarcasm. Then a poisoned patient is brought in by a handsome stranger, and I thought oh right, this is gonna be a murder mystery, nice. While trying to find clues about this murder victim, Miles is also trying to solve a medical mystery, a dangerous madness that affects soldiers recently come back from war. So about a third/halfway into the book I thought, ok this is gonna be about solving this puzzle with the soldiers. But then in the last third it becomes clear that there’s an even bigger fish, strap in everybody cause it gets insane. The final showdown ending scene is so dramatic, powerful and emotional. I wasn’t expecting it all to wrap up so well in a relatively short book, but I was very happy with the ending. 

I really liked Miles, but I’m generally a huge fan of good characters. I passionately hated his sister, especially because she was seemingly moderate, wanting change for the oppressed class, but really pulling the same oppressive shit herself. She’s gonna be the protagonist in book 2, and I’m very concerned over how that’ll go. I thought love interest was interesting enough, though I was expecting a lot more of the book to be focused on their relationship, that’s not a complaint just an observation. 

Oh I almost forgot, bicycles are an important part of worldbuilding, with even a bicycle chase at one point, and that’s super cool.

**Book 1:** *Into the Labyrinth*

*Hugh of Emblin is, so far as he's concerned, the worst student that the Academy at Skyhold has ever seen. He can barely cast any spells at all, and those he does cast tend to fail explosively. If that wasn't bad  enough, he's also managed to attract the ire of the most promising student of his year - who also happens to be the nephew of a king. Hugh has no friends, no talent, and definitely doesn't expect a mage to choose him as an apprentice at all during the upcoming Choosing.*

*When a very unusual mage does choose him as apprentice, however, his life starts to take a sharp turn for the better. Now all he has to worry about is the final test for the first years - being sent into the terrifying labyrinth below Skyhold.*

***Book 2:*** *Jewel of the Endless Erg*

*After surviving Skyhold's deadly labyrinth, Hugh and his friends are  looking forwards to an uneventful summer. Their teacher, Alustin, has chartered a sandship for a training expedition into the vast sea of sand known as the Endless Erg, aiming for the wealthy and powerful desert city of Theras Tel. Hugh's happier than he's been in a long, long time,  and he's quite excited for the fresh air, sunshine, and quiet.*

*Of course, given Hugh's luck, their summer is going to be anything but quiet. They're about to be plunged into a morass of pirates, monsters, warring cults, flesh-tearing sandstorms, and a conspiracy against Indris Stormbreaker, the dragon queen of Theras Tel herself.*

I got into reading fantasy from casually playing RPG video games. I usually play a magic using character and like magic-heavy fantasy books, but also enjoy support/healing/priest roles.

699,"What would you recommend to gift to 3 non-fantasy readers (yet)Hi everyone, 

TLDR at the bottom if you don't care for long read and just want to give ideas.

I'm a lifelong fantasy fan, and a aspiring evangelist for the genre. Long story short, i'm trying to show to 3 of my family members (different ages and personalities) the beauty and learnings of the Fantasy genre, by offering them each a book to start their journeys.

But that book needs to click with them, i'll probably only have 1 shot at this. I've read many, but not all, and their names might have fadded with time. Also i've forgotten exactly when i read which, and maybe your experience with a book at one age was special and you'd recomend it. 

I've got ideas, but i'd be happy to get your opinion and suggestions! 

What books to you recommend to:

\- 1) father of 2, middle-aged, likes painting cultural references, history and well-thinkers. Tried LOTR once but never passed the 3rd chapter (for which i can hardly blame him)

\- 2) a young woman of 19, very cultured introvert, loves reading and traveling but ""the serious stuff""

\- 3)  teenage of 15, super dynamic and lively, loves animals and reading but never got given a (real) fantasy book to try her teeth on

&amp;#x200B;

PS: they saw GOT (the TV show) so that's off the table - i want them to feel the hunger for what comes next. 

Current ideas:

For the 1) Father: NO IDEA - It needs to have a valuable life lesson in, something to embody the power of empathy and epicness that fantasy can bring, but needs to stay on the ground. Maybe Anne Mc Caffrey's Pern, but the dragon are a big risk. 

2) the 19yoF: Anne Mc Caffrey's Pern, too. The Name of the Wind  - P. Rothfus

3) the 15yoF: Royal Assassin by Robin Hobb (for NightEyes) - Or SilverWing by Kenneth Opel (but i read it a while back, is it good for a 15yo?) - Or Eragon?

I loved it. Having read most of the big fantasy series and being a little jaded by the genre, this was a much needed book for me as a reader and as a person. It uses familiar ideas and tropes but are executed to near perfection. There's so much to talk about, but I'm most impressed by the sheer amount of themes and issues M.L. Wang addressed in a standalone: traditionalism vs modernism, culture, propaganda, family, duty, honor, feminism, masculinity, growing up, identity, motherhood, parenthood, &gt;!war, rape, abuse, suicide, abortion, !&lt; and it all works so well.

I think there are two reasons for this: First, the characters. The small cast of 2 POV protagonists and 5-6 supporting characters were excellent. Mamoru offered the traditional coming-of-age perspective but his intelligence and good nature made his inner conflict more interesting without being frustrating to read about (Fitz) or divisive (Kvothe). I was able to identify with him because he made sound decisions even when he was distraught. Maturity in a coming-of-age story sounds counterintuitive at first but gives real weight to his problems. Anyone would feel the same in his position - even an adult.

That's where our second protagonist comes in. Misaki is a sharp contrast to Mamoru in her responsibilities and inner conflict because of her gender and age. She's Mamoru's mother instead of a love interest/rival. This was a first for me. It  creates a preexisting dynamic that is rarely explored in fantasy that adds another layer to an already interesting character. She is haunted by a violent past that is the core of her character, and feels that way - too many times in fantasy, we're left with snarky references and hints that needs multiple books of buildup before the payoff. The fact that she faces the issue every day &gt;!and how quickly it became relevant!&lt; made it more impactful.

Between them we can see life in their village from every aspect. In my opinion, a character is shaped by their relationships with others rather than their backstory. The supporting characters all served to challenge or help our protagonists' while remaining fully fleshed out themselves.

Still, they never steal the spotlight. Our focus remains with the two protagonists. Mamoru was a gentle soul trying to find the right direction in his life while Misaki was already accustomed to violence and a purpose in her life only to have it wrenched away and forced into a different path. Their similarities and differences played off each other very well &gt;!(even more impressive that they only had one interaction)!&lt;, and made it easy for me to be invested.

They're excellent characters with growth and flaws. But that's nothing new. I found myself wondering why I was so attached to them and to the story. The answer is the second driving force: the setting.

The worldbuilding is good. It's unique and interesting without being unfamiliar or confusing. But I'm not referring to the grand, imaginative work that is associated with Sanderson or Erikson. It's the culture that stood out for me. It's nearly identical to Japanese culture, down to the mannerisms and language, and as a fan of manga and anime, it was a little amusing when I first realized it. But as the book continued, it became more and more meaningful.

I'm Southeast Asian with Chinese blood. I grew up surrounded by Chinese friends, teachers, peers, relatives, holidays, celebrations, and traditions that have many similarities with Japanese culture. It was a delight to read an Asian-inspired fantasy.

I always hear about the importance of representation but never bought into it. I dismissed them as shameless plug-ins or shoehorned plot points to appeal to a wider audience: unnecessary at best and cringy at worst. But for some reason, the Sword of Kaigen nailed it. I realized then that this is what representation should mean. It portrays the good and the bad. Everyone likes reading about samurai, honor, and bravery, but the sexism, racism, and abusive families that are equally prevalent in Asian culture needs to be brought up too. Representation becomes delusional when you focus on the good and insulting when you focus on the bad. The Sword of Kaigen manages to find the balance.

I was so invested because the problems that they faced were real to me. Their challenges were analogous to the expectations set in my culture for men (be brave, be strong, never show emotion, lead the family, be tough with your children, be more successful/richer/more hardworking than your wife) and for women (be gentle, soft-spoken, and meek; raise a family, avoid friendships with men, be skinny, be beautiful, marry into a good family, have sons, handle the household). It's disturbing how easy it was to put myself in Mamoru's shoes. If I were a girl, I don't doubt it would be equally easy to put myself in Misaki's shoes.

I've read a lot of good fantasy but nothing reached out to me like the Sword of Kaigen. This is the first book that spoke to me on a personal level. I know that's wishy-washy and cliched, but it's true.

Mamoru's journey for identity, purpose, and maturity; Misaki's avoidance of her responsibilities; Takashi's frustration with his duties; Setsuko and Hyori's struggle for independence in a man's world; Kwang's difficulty to accept his country's traditional culture, and most of all, everything Takeru's had to face. They all hit home.

The awesome and clean action was amazing and would've been the focus of a review for any other book, but it's the themes, cultures, and characterization that launches the Sword of Kaigen into my personal pantheon of fantasy books along with the Percy Jackson series for introducing me to fantasy, A Game of Thrones for teaching me that fantasy could be complex, The Name of the Wind for teaching me that fantasy could be beautiful, and Oathbringer for teaching me that fantasy could be inspirational.

But this isn't a perfect book. The writing in the first quarter of the book was a little weak. There were some odd choices with sentence/paragraph structure that jarred me and a few missing words here and there. The ending felt like a forced setup for future novels. I think the last quarter or so of the book could be revised and condensed to improve the story massively.

TL;DR: That being said, The Sword of Kaigen is the first truly meaningful novel I've ever read. It's a little rough around the edges, but for everything else that matters - story, characterization, worldbuilding, action, dialogue, pacing, and structure - it's perfect. I loved this book. I doubt I'll reread it because the story and characters will stay with me forever.

Objectively 8.5/10 but personally 11/10.

703,"Say one thing for Steven Pacey, say he's an amazing narrator. And Joe Abercrombie a great writer part 2 (Before They Are Hanged, Spoilers).Since my previous post about [The Blade Itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/e9fnkr/say_one_thing_for_steven_pacey_say_hes_an_amazing/) was received well I figured I would do another one. I finished Before They Are Hanged today, and I am already reading the Last Argument of Kings.

Overall I really liked it even if I have mixed feelings about 1/3 of the plot. Let me just say that Glokta's storyline and West/Dogman's misadventures in the North were my favorite parts, I really loved both of them even though I guess they were more of the side plot? I was actually really excited about the war storyline and kept waiting for it to happen in book 1 so I am really glad that the second book delivered on it, I really enjoy West as a character too and seeing him elevated to more of a main player (or at least that is what it felt like) this book was nice. And Glokta's plot had a lot of urgency and I really enjoyed seeing him politicking around.

As for the main quest, I still really enjoyed the characters Logen, Luthar (his development was like the best part of the book though), and Bayaz being the highlights here, with Longfoot being good for a laugh every now and then. VENGEANCE is fine, but she cannot carry scenes for me the way the main trio can and there was a lot more of her in this book than the last. Her little romance with Logen was really funny though, LMAO I need more Steven Pacey narrating sex scenes in my life.

My issue would be that the whole journey was just not as interesting, the setting was not as good as the city from the first book (there is a distinct lack of Ardee in this one, also Sult who I thought was called Salt until I looked it up) since the path of the journey does not feel lived in, intentional probably I know but Logen going B9 against a bunch of ~~Orks~~ Shanka is not as engaging as him doing the same against humans, and while interesting things do happen, there is some nice worldbuilding, and the character moments are awesome I did end up feeling like this was the weakest storyline. It did not help that sometimes 2 chapters one after another were both about this plotline which I don't think even happened in the first book which made things feel fresher every time. Also, is it me or was Quai really different in this book than the last? I just felt like his character was pretty different from when he was first introduced, maybe someone else who binge read the books can tell me if they felt the same.

But anyways I do not want you to feel like I did not still enjoy these parts, the banter between Bayaz and the female magi was great, and I was laughing out loud in the morning about this entire little detour being essentially a shaggy dog story character development aside. Now quickly for the characters:

**Collem ""Furious, Nice Guy"" West, and Prince Ladisla:** Like I said I enjoy West, he is absolutely terrible, but I can enjoy a character who actually cares about his fellow man. We already knew about West's horrible temper, now we know he is a real charmer around the ladies though (poor Cathil deserved better) but in this book, he really tries his hardest to keep things together and tbh the Union should probably thank him for not losing the war right then and there. As for Ladisla, he was the perfect vain oaf, I really enjoyed the accent that Pacey went with for him. He was absolutely horrible, but very entertaining and frustrating. I know West killing him was not a triumphant moment, but holy shit that guy was a waste of space.

**Dogman, Threetrees, and Black Dow:** Dogman is probably who I have the least to say about out of all the perspective characters in this book. Threetrees was really epic in that final charge, and tbh I just really liked him as a leader. Black Dow is so comically awful that I find myself laughing every time he opens his mouth. Oh yeah Shivers was nice too even if only see him for like all of 5 minutes.

Thank you for reading, I realize this was a long post. I am really enjoying this series and I look forward to posting my thoughts about the final book in the trilogy!",1

707,"How do you guys feel about fantasy homophobia?I'm in an rp server for a video game that I play, and it takes place in a fantasy world of course. They try really hard actually to be accurate with how life was in super early medieval times by having the buildings be time-accurate, the social/political structure of the land, the economy, jobs, all that fun stuff.

Thing is... they also decided to bring in normalized homophobia, with a death penalty for High Elves, because they have a really hard time reproducing and are essentially purists/nazis. They did this because they wanted the server to be more ""accurate"" for the times. As a gay guy, I just frankly find this offensive and unnecessary. You get to build this fantastical world where anything can happen, but yet you still decide to bring in homophobia for the ""authenticity"" and ""realism""? Come on. And the other people on the server defend it too! Saying things like ""it's realistic/accurate"" or ""It makes for interesting rp!"". Which honestly makes me feel even worse about it!

There are people out there suffering from real-life homophobia and are at actual danger from exposing themselves to other people. But yet people enjoy RP-ing that kind of experience in a fantasy world because ""it makes for interesting rp"". Give me a break. I've experienced it for real, and it's not fun or INTERESTING. It was painful, and to see people think that it makes for interesting rp just makes my experiences feel trivialized.

Someone else on the server I got in a heated discussion with told me that I'm taking this way too personally and that I don't have to be there if I don't want to. I also told him that as a writer it feels cheap, and then he asked me if I wrote a 10 book long fantasy series, I wouldn't have homophobia in any of it. I said yes. Imagine a whole series like Fire and Ice where nobody gave a fuck about being gay. He said that it was retarded.

I can see why he'd think I'm taking this too personally, but I still think my feelings are valid about this subject. What do you guys think about the concept of homophobia in fantasy worlds?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: So, just to clarify first and foremost, I'm not saying that homophobia is worse than murder, war, rape, genocide, etc. I'm just complaining about homophobia specifically within fantasy settings, not about any other kind of problem because that's not what this post is about. Anyways, the server claims that the homophobia thing doesn't reflect the views of the staff and apparently a lot of people play openly gay characters. Even the king is supposedly bisexual. It's just the elves that can't be gay. Still, I think it's pretty derogatory and it makes me feel weird to have people wanting to RP as a gay-persecuted character cause it's ""interesting"". I get why people would want to include it though, the same thing with fantasy racism/sexism. Thing is, I understand it if it was in a novel, movie, show, or a single-player game. In an RP server it just makes me feel legitimately uncomfortable that it's expected to act homophobic towards gay characters because as others said, it feels like a reason to act out homophobic fantasies and all that. I'm going to keep playing on the server, but to be quiet honest it has put me off a lot about the whole thing, and it really makes me hesitant to create gay characters because I'm scared that they're going to get killed for being gay, which isn't an experience I want to live out or RP as.",1

The most important thing I'm looking for is a strong emotional pull toward the main protagonist, with no other guy in the picture. A few examples of books I've read that I enjoyed.

Overworld Chronicles by John Corvin. If you can look past the atrocious cover, its a fulfilling if a bit simplistic YA series.

Daniel Faust by Craig Schaefer. Similar to Dresden Files, but with an incredibly well done romance that lasts the entire series.

Empath Rising by Archibald Bradford. One of those guilty pleasure silly erotic harem books, but probably the best one of the bunch.

Zero Sight by B. Justin Shier. The best book I wish i never read. The author stopped after the second book and the ending was heartbreaking that promised more in the future.

The Rhenwars Saga by M L Spencer. The main romance intrest only appeared from book 2, she hated him at first, only to be an incredible love between husband and wife.

Is there a fantasy novel that has these types discover a ""primitive"" people that actually have magic, killer amazons, hidden supertech like Wakanda, dragons or whatever?

I honestly would write this myself, but I'm not enough of a historian to write about actual conquistadors or British imperialists meeting the wrath of pagan gods or some such.

I blame the pesky vagaries of a Western education that was much more focused on proper punctuation than on the arcane workings of internet boards. Also, it is worth mentioning I am not a native speaker, so grammar nazis beware.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not, of usual, have made a post. In fact, as stated above, I quite litterally never have before. On any other day upon finishing that chapter of **Children of Blood and Bone** circa page 200 I would have simply -internally or externally- shaken my head in silent disapproval and carried on with my day (which turned out to mean, Reddit notwithstanding, buying **Nevernight** and **Grey Sister**, to replace CBB as tonight's entertainment). However, I had an argument -a friendly one, with taunts and jests, not the Thanksgiving throw-plates-at-your-sister-in-law type- with a friend of mine pre-Christmas, and between the bilge he talked and the fact that I do not have that many friends who read fantasy, I decided to turn to the internet. The internet, of course, always makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

**Children of Blood and Bone** is, in a word, not good. This post is not meant as a review of the book, so I shan't get into it much more than that, especially since I have been able to find on this august board a couple of reviews that capture my thoughts about it rather neatly -one of which is even up for one of those fancy Stabbies people seem to be so excited about. Others, of course, disagree with my opinion of the book, and in fact rather like it, which is naturally perfectly fine - as long as we're understood that when I rise to power, those sorts of people will be the first to go.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not surprising to find a bad book, the abound. They are, like Thanos, inevitable. It is somewhat more surprising to find a bad book that has received multiple awards and the amount of acclaim **CBB** has. One raises an eyebrow, and wonders how much something like the fantasy-Nigeria part of the premise might have spurred the excitement of the more woke-oriented members of the readership, but that is not what this post is about either. Rather, and I promise I am coming to the point now, it is about a sentence, a defence of bad writing I often find when I browse the internet in search of opinions on books I have usually already read, a defence I found today on the topic of this selfsame book, and that my friend uttered the other day with the you're-taking-this-too-seriously tone my friends sometimes get when I ramble about narrative consistency or the demographics of Harry Potter:

&amp;#x200B;

« It's fantasy! »

&amp;#x200B;

As inoffensive as this particular disposition of words may be, I find it stomach-churning. Although I admire and envy the brevity of it, its meaning borders on the offensive. It means something like:

&amp;#x200B;

« It doesn't matter. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? »

&amp;#x200B;

« This is only a second rate genre, what were you expecting? »

&amp;#x200B;

« Who cares about that, it's just fantasy. »

&amp;#x200B;

« You can't apply the same standards you do for *real* books - for literature. »

&amp;#x200B;

And there is my Hodgmanian crux, the proverbial root of the matter. It seems to me that fans and detractors of fantasy alike too often employ standards inferior to those they otherwise would when it comes to the genre. Of the detractors, this is to be expected ; of the fans, it is altogether more perplexing. It is, in fact, entirely paradoxical.

&amp;#x200B;

Presumably, people who spend time reading fantasy novels, and potentially talking about them with their friends or on the internet actually like the stuff. I will go so far as to say they quite enjoy those books and hold them in some level of high regard reminiscent of how Wallace looks at cheese. A subset of the fantasy readership is content with subpar writing. They might welcome good prose and careful structure, but do not consider them a necessity. Events need not make sense, character development may be sloppy, and logic is a high minded luxury. Often there is an appeal to escapism. Made up worlds need not abide by the stringent laws of sense and reason. To demand style and wordcraft out of books about wizards and dragons is pretentious and a corruption of what should be an easy read.

&amp;#x200B;

The attentive reader will have guessed that I -rather emphatically- disagree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback to the discussion with my friend on the topic of **The Witcher** series of books. While he was arguing that the novels started off well but became odd and disjointed later on, I posited that there were significant weaknesses all the way back to **Blood of Elves**. One of my main gripes (this is a complaint I have about multiple series) was that the entirety of Ciri's training and study of the witchering arts happens during her stay at Kaer Morhen. By the end of something like six months, and at the ripe old age of fourteen, Ciri is so formidable a fencer that there is only a character in the entire series that gives her any trouble. To my scepticism about the verisimilitude my friend replied, you will have guessed it,

&amp;#x200B;

« It's fantasy! »

&amp;#x200B;

I care about verisimilitude. I realise many people are of the opinion that bending certain scientific and logical norms as the premise of fantasy opens the door to all sorts of shortcuts, but I belong to the School of Logical Within the Bounds of the Premise. I am hardly a maverick, many other people subscribe to this philosophy, but I shall restate its central tenets nonetheless:

&amp;#x200B;

* *The premise behind the series is the sole permitted breach of the laws of physics, human nature, and reason.*
* *Within those bounds, all must follow the customary logic of things.* 

&amp;#x200B;

When I hear people dismiss what I consider plot holes with a special dispensation they reserve for fantasy, it does not strike me so much as a difference in philosophy than as a lower standard to which they hold the genre. There is a reasonable exception to be made of literature meant for children when it comes to themes they are not old enough to deal with, or **Harry Potter** would have had to be substantially saucier. Any other time however, when I hear that « it doesn't matter » if the children are acting on the level of rationality of adults, or « why do you care » if power levels are entirely inconsistent, what I hear is « the genre we both enjoy is not worth the effort required to construct a story seriously and with care ». I resent that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also resent the notion that, for some reason, style does not matter. I will be the first to admit I love **Mistborn** and **The Stormlight Archive**, even though, by his own admission, Sanderson is by no means a master stylist - and I hear there are complaints about his dialogue. But while there are some fantastic books out there written in plain, unremarkable prose, I in no way see that as a reason not to want the best possible English out of any book I read, whatever the genre may be. There is some gorgeous prose out there that proves that, not only is it entirely feasible to write fantasy well, the genre can be an opportunity for downright groundbreaking stuff. I couldn't name two non-epistolary series written in the second person to save my life. **The Broken Earth** does not only that, but also delivers in sheer quality. Not everyone can be Jemisin, but they could try (Adonalsium knows it couldn't hurt Adeyemi).

&amp;#x200B;

I do not begrudge people who look for something different in fantasy than me. If they are happy reading something that would make me roll my eyes or look up the author's contact info so I could shout at them about their split infinitives or their violent overuse of mentions of the tugging of braids, so be it. It is only when I hear remarks about what fantasy « should » be that my hackles rise. A personal preference has nothing to do with the character of the genre as a whole, and to reduce it to whatever one's cup of tea might be is an uncalled for reduction that can only be harmful. It invites unhelpful kerfuffles about conflicting predilections and limits, for all involved, the scope of what fantasy *could* be.

&amp;#x200B;

« It's fantasy! » is such a reduction. It limits the possibilities of fantasy by waving away standards. It is a surrender that all but ensures we won't see great books in the future because expectations can only be shattered if they're there to begin with. It discourages those who would do better and threatens to destroy the very idea of quality, for when standards slacken or disappear we are left with no reference point to judge a book. To paraphrase ol' spiky hair, if all books are good, none of them are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I should come to a conclusion at some point. What started as a post has become a protracted rant (I think the polite vernacular these days is ""essay"") and one would hope there might be a point to it all. I will therefore wrap this up with a plea.

I felt like both Sarene and Raodyn had well-developed motivations and personalities, so it didn't feel like their initial conflicts were contrived or overdone. One other problem I often have with this trope is that the female lead can come off overly callous and/or open up way too drastically/suddenly, but I didn't feel that was the case here. Their dynamic feels very grounded to me.

The romance aspect was also a great jumping-off point for the development of Sarene, who is hands-down my favorite character in the novel. I'm not shy about the fact that I like tomboy-ish women and I was actually able to relate to her personal struggles and insecurities quite a lot despite being a man. She especially shines in comparison to Raodyn, (whom I felt was a bit too ""perfect""), striking a greater balance of flaws and badassery. 

The exploration of sexism and traditional female gender roles in the novel was also well done. Sometimes these things can be overly preachy about the anti-sexism aspect (we get it, sexism bad). I really admired the way she stood her ground and was unapologetically who she was without playing the victim. The text itself doesn't come off as white-knighty either. All in all, I think it's a pretty even handed and mature take on both sexism in real life and the type of sexism one might expect to find in the sorts of medieval societies that fantasy novels are often based on. 

I actually found myself enjoying Elantris for many reasons, though. The split perspective of Raodyn, Sarene, and Hrathen was masterfully done. I enjoyed seeing their various takes on one another, their incomplete information coloring their perceptions and schemes in logical ways. Sarene's political duel with Hrathen over the throne was the highlight of the novel for me. I come from mainly reading old school high fantasy/pulp/sword-and-sorcery tales, so a slow burn court intrigue was quite the change of pace for me and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. 

My only complaint is that Elantris is perhaps a bit too slow at times. Some scenes seem like gratuitous filler that serve to provide expositionary dialouge about the setting, either reminding us about something for the xth time or filling in a random detail about the history of the world. While I enjoy Sanderson's imagination and Opelan did feel like a very rich and interesting place, cutting some of this down and making the narrative tighter would have been more to my liking. Some of the ""mystery"" elements were a little weak--come on, surely they could have solved a few of them a lot more quickly for how smart the characters are supposed to be. 

Overall though, I think my gripes are very minor. There were very few times I wasn't having fun ""reading"" this book and would be inclined to check out more works by Sanderson or even similar works by other authors.",1
720,"Is it just me, or most fantasy games from Japan feel far more magical, dreamlike, adventurous and fantasy than their Western counterparts?As a very big fantasy fan, I have been playing mostly fantasy related games (there are always exceptions of course) and after all those years I have realized this: that most fantasy games from Japan feel far more fantasy than most of the Western ones. 

Personally when I am looking for a fantasy game, I want to feel like I am actually playing a fantasy game, I want to feel this sense of adventure, I want the world around to feel magical, like it came out from a dream, I want to really feel the fantasy if you know what I mean. 

Fantasy games I have played that felt like they are magical, fantasy, dreamlike or came out from a fairy tale were most of the time Japanese ones. 

Honestly almost every Western fantasy game that I have played, it felt like a boring, uninspired and generic realistic setting that developers just tossed in some fantasy elements and called it a day. 

I never felt like they even tried to make you believe that they are fantasy games, they were more like ""well yeah I have elves, dwarves, dragons and some magic so I am a fantasy game because of that"" or something like that. 

Some of the best Japanese fantasy games that I have played, games like Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time, Breath Of The Wild, Final Fantasy VII, Shadow Of The Colossus, Dark Souls and Chrono Trigger almost always deliver this sense of magic, mystery, adventure and fantasy inside them and really make you feel the fantasy. 

On the other side some of the best Western fantasy games that I have played, games like Skyrim, Dragon Age Origins, Star Wars KOTOR, Fable The Lost Chapters, The Witcher 2, Shadow Of Mordor, a little of Baldur's Gate 2, Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2,  almost none of them made me feel this sense of magic and fantasy in them, seriously almost all of them felt exactly that: boring realistic settings with some fantasy elements tossed in just to slap the fantasy tag on the cover while barely trying. 

From all of those fantasy games only Star Wars KOTOR, Warcraft 3 and Fable The Lost Chapters made me feel that, but not as much as the Japanese ones, and almost all of the other fantasy games I have played, their fantasy aspect felt completely soulless and dead inside, I cannot describe it more accurately. 

While on the other side all of the Japanese fantasy games that I have played and mentioned above never felt like that, but felt like actual fantasy games. 

Am I the only one feeling this way or it is indeed true?  Because as a huge fantasy fan who is always searching to experience this sense of magic, dreamlike experience and adventure it almost never came from Western fantasy games, but almost always from Japanese ones.",1

724,"Thank You Everyone, From an Author (using an alt account)Hi everyone.

I am one of the active indie authors on this sub. For the last couple of years I have partaken in the conversations, posts, discussions, art, promotions, along with every variety of other shenaniganry which takes place here on r/Fantasy, and I wanted to take the opportunity to say something pretty simple that a *lot* of authors might wish to, but can to easily be seen as self-promotion.

So, using an alt account that has nothing to do with my profession profile:

**THANK YOU. YOU ARE ALL AWESOME.**

This is a moment appreciation from all of us, trad and indie authors alike, for the likes of every friendly, positive, serious, and valuable contributor on this sub. To the lurkers who buy our stuff and like our posts. To the conversationalists who take part, offering valid discussion and topics to talk about. To the reviewers who take the time to read and give feedback on our books (even if we don't always like it). To the mods who (even though we all gripe about you at some point for some reason or another, myself included) sacrifice the time and make the effort to do the largely-thankless job of keep this sub as clean, friendly, and inclusive a place as possible, where everyone has a voice and a place to make it heard.

This sub has directly contributed to my own success so-far as a writer, and has done much the same for many others. Beyond that, however, you have all created an incredible platform from which authors can keep up to date on topics, take part and make a name for themselves, keep up on the latest trends, and get feedback on their work in some form or another. 

It is hugely, and genuinely, appreciated.

With 2020 rolling in strong and the possibility of 1 MILLION members in this sub, I hope r/Fantasy continues to be the positive place it has been (at least for me), and grows for the better in every way it can. I'm excited for my own new year, and I foresee this space being a big part of that enjoyment.

Keep reading, friends.

Sincerely,

However, I have no idea how to read the book. There's no real introduction, it just throws you in the deep end on everything and talks about a lot of characters as if we already know who they are. It also keeps jumping around and there's not enough time to get used to the characters I'm reading about before there's a scene change. I managed to get to the part where the ancient hero guy tells one of his subordinates that the little girl who might be the main character (it's unclear) that she can level a city but is terrible at basic Craft. The world of hell interests me but it's also so confusing. we meet so many characters in the space of a couple chapters that it seems way to hard to keep up with. I can barely remember any of their names and I have no idea who the main character is and the book will just start up a new scene and then drop it. It feels like I'm reading a book in the middle of the series recapping the events of the previous book. I'm not sure how to proceed.",1
727,"Ex-Purgatory (Ex-Heroes) by Peter Clines Book Reviewhttp://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1764-expurgatory



3.5/5

Ex-Purgatory is the fourth novel in the popular Ex-Heroes series. It's been fun watching the survivors of a comic book universe deal with a zombie apocalypse and try to slowly rebuild civilization. Likewise, it's been nice seeing a lot of classic comic book plots reinterpreted for a post-apocalyptic zombie-filled world. The premiseis a reinterpretation of the classic Superman plot by Alan Moore, ""For The Man Who Has Everything."" Basically, that superheroes are trapped in a dream-like state and live lives where they don't have to deal with the responsibilities of being a superhero (or at least its downside).

This plot has been re-interpreted numerous times, most recently the House of M crossover event for Marvel. I also feel there's influence from the movie Inception and The Matrix with an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation name checked for good measure. It's a good plot that changes every time it's used with different players. Why? Because it's a good plot and a great way to show off characterization.

Ex-Purgatory begins with Saint George a.k.a the Mighty Dragon working as a janitor at a local university. He is haunted by strange dreams but the world hasn't been destroyed so he's reasonably content. The mystery of what's going on occupies roughly 75% of the novel with the villain responsible revealed early but not the how. Ultimately, the book ends with an effective twist.

The book increases the role of Madelyn a.k.a Corpse Girl dramatically. Introduced in the previous volume, we get some more insights into her personality and ideas. Sadly, we don't get to know much more about her past. What sort of life did Madelyn live before things went to hell? What would she have preferred to do? We do get insights into just about everyone else, however, with Stealth's backstory being the most fleshed out. I'm not sure I cared for it but I trust Peter Clines knows what he's doing.

If I have any regrets, it's the fact Ex-Purgatory is a little too ""safe."" Ex-Heroes and Ex-Patriots introduced most of the concepts that have been used in this book and its predecessor. I'm eager to see something new and exciting. Unfortunately, this feels very self-contained and a little bit like a reunion special. The plot isn't moving forward and I'd very much like to see something radical happen like the discovery of another survivor settlement or a trip to the future.

We get some insight into the backstory of Stealth that reveals she's the daughter of a prominent Somali terrorist but this tantalizing bit of backstory is not something that gets much insight. I would have liked a lot more discussion of this as it helps change the character's Doc Savage-esque origin to something darker. How she was trained by her father and what purpose before she became a model as well as genius would have made a fascinating story on its own, even without the brainwashing element.

There's also the fact, for a zombie novel, it doesn't have that much in the way of zombies. The ""Exes"" make an appearance in the book at critical moments but feel almost like an afterthought. Despite the critical threat they posed in previous books, they're treated barely as a threat in Ex-Purgatory. While I wouldn't recommend going Walking Dead on the cast, I'd like to see them take center stage. The Exes are what separate this series from other superhero comics.

Fans of Ex-Heroes will continue to enjoy this new volume in the series but those who are looking to pick up the series should start earlier. Ex-Purgatory is a very continuity-reliant book and would be almost incomprehensible to a new reader. Still, I enjoyed it. The humor is sharp, the characters are likable, and the story allows them to show new sides of themselves. Unfortunately, this book suffers from the fact that not much progress is made in the storyline. It feels like the characters and the world are in the same place at the end of the book that they were at the beginning of it. Sadly, there is only one more book left in the series that leaves many issues unresolved.",1

730,"Book about a protagonist with an interesting ""class""I read a few fantasy books and in every one protagonist falls into a d&amp;d category. It is usally a warrior or a barbarian like Bloody Nine in First law,a mage/wizard(Dresden) or a rogue/thief(Locke Lamora). Maybe even a combination of the two and it is not a bad thing by any means. I was just wondering if there are any fantasy books where a POV character is something very different like an engineer or an alchemist. I am reading Malazan and I am enjoying Fiddler as a character a lot especially because he is a sapper,he can barely use a sword but he is very deadly with crossbow and explosives.

Sort of like the old pulps like Doc Savage and Princess of Mars, etc. That said, I'm looking for more modern books, if you know of them. The more recent the better.

One other reason, other than just wanting to read something like this, is that I'm a writer and want to see what other writers are doing in this particular space.

I originally got into it through forum boards, and did that for several years. Then I discovered D&amp;D, and sinthat for many years. Now I get my fantasy fix from a Minecraft RP server and I can't imagine RPing any other way now.

How do you guys prefer to RP and get that Fantasy fix? RP in another type of game? Forum Rp? Discord?

737,"Do you guys feel differently post-reading a book when you hear that it has a deeper religious connotation that isn't presented directly?I've read a number of fantasy and Sci-fi books that I really enjoyed and upon further analyses (Googling and forums) and conversations with friends I'd discovered that some of them were really about presenting certain religious ideas when looked at much more deeply. 

I personally didn't have a problem with this. At the level at which I had read and enjoyed the story, I missed some religious connotations and post-reading, learning about them didn't hinder my view but I have heard that for some people this really does spoil a book sometimes.

I've been wondering why and if it's only a small group who feels this way. There are many levels to stories and what is presented at a higher doesn't necessarily have to negate the lower levels of the tale [IMO].",1

Websites like royal road, but recently i came across a book, called a journey in black and red. This is the book that i am recomending. And if anyone knows it, are there any books like this!? I have really enjoyed the look into vampire society and politics that are in the book. I love how all of the powers are used, and i like how vampires are portrayed in the book. So if anyone has any recommendations for a vampire book where
The lead is a vampire,
The book goes into vampire society. (in the a journey of black and red it is set roughly in 1619, and the vampires have ""houses"" which each have their own teritory and politics between each other)
It explores vampire powers in interesting ways
Vampires arent inherently evil, its just what they are the hunt and kill because that is their nature.

What i am not looking for: traditional mystery or classic vampire novels, i apreciate novels like dracular and how it influenced modern Literature but im afraid to say i never really enjoyed it. Maby i was too young when i read it. 

What i am looking for: a book that takes all the vampire myths and powers, (having to be invited in, shape shifting, charm powers, etc) and using them in new and interesting ways in a fresh take on vampire fiction) 

Sorry for the long post. 

TLDR: recommend me good vampire books about vampire society and politics, with a vampire lead, where vampires arent inherently evil.",1

##**[The Memory Police by Yoko Ogawa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45165750-the-memory-police)**##

&gt;A deft and dark Orwellian novel about the terrors of state surveillance, from the acclaimed author of *The Housekeeper and the Professor*.

&gt;On an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, things are disappearing. First, animals and flowers. Then objects—ribbons, bells, photographs. Then, body parts. Most of the island’s inhabitants fail to notice these changes, while those few imbued with the power to recall the lost objects live in fear of the mysterious “memory police,” who are committed to ensuring that the disappeared remain forgotten. When a young novelist realizes that more than her career is in danger, she hides her editor beneath her floorboards, and together, as fear and loss close in around them, they cling to literature as the last way of preserving the past. Part allegory, part literary thriller, *The Memory Police* is a stunning new work from one of the most exciting contemporary authors writing in any language.

743,"[Review] Turning Darkness Into Light by Marie Brennan **Writing Reviews on New Year's Eve eh. You animal...**  
Look sarky alter-ego, this review is very overdue. I got this one from Netgalley and read it months ago, and what better time to complete tasks I should have done a long time ago? I probably should have done this before Christmas so you could know how awesome it is so you could have all asked for it for as a gift. But hey, at least I got my mum it, so that's one person who gets to know.  
Besides, what better title than 'Turning Darkness Into Light' for the end of a year like this?  
**Explain the Awesome.**  
*Turning Darkness Into Light* is the story of a young scholar asked to translate recently discovered and politically sensitive texts belonging to an ancient Draconian accent. And it's told in the form of diaries, letters and translations.  
And it is written incredibly well.  
Sometimes when reading a book, I feel like I can almost see the author smiling in satisfaction at just how much they're nailing the story. Like they're an athlete showboating. That's almost certainly not what's happening but it's what my mind's eye sees anyway. And *Turning Darkness Into Light* reads like Marie Brennan's completely utterly confident about her brilliance. I mean, she'll write the same passage of translated text twice, but once as poorly translated and once as expertly translated. How utterly boss is that? This is a difficult format for a story and Brennan makes it look easy.  
**Is this more than just awesomely written and smart?**  
Yes. I don't buy my mum less than excellent books. The characterisation is sharp and while perhaps a tad reliant on stereotype, it's well done enough that not many people who like the stereotypes will complain. The plot in particular is really good though. It is slow moving - as if Brennan is perfectly confident the quality of her writing will keep people invested enough for it to get going - but compelling and a little twisty. The last minute reveal in particular got me.  
The ending did feel a tad on the nose for me, and the subplot maybe a little too rooted in romance, but these are minor gripes. And the subplot's more about a failed one than a beginning one, which makes it more interesting.  
That said, I am mainly just here for the writing and the idea.  
**Any other weaknesses?**  
There's a long list of things *Turning Darkness Into Light* isn't but those are authorial choices, not weaknesses. And it looks like everything Marie Brennan did set out to do, she did. She did it really well. I feel confident that 9 out of 10 readers who are up for the diary written account of a not-Victorian Fantasy academic will really enjoy this book.  
And that sums up everything I have to say. *Turning Darkness Into Light* is one of the most astonishingly well executed books I read all of last year.

744,"A Useful Read for Fantasy Authors 

I think it's hard as a fantasy  writer - particularly a non indie author - to look strategically at the business of publishing. Most people who write comments or make predictions, tend to do so from the specific viewpoint of where they are in the industry (only natural) and, hence, it's very hard to develop a strategy approach that encompasses both the high level drivers and the detailed responses to them relative to an individual business/author.

Mark Coker's yearly Publishing Predictions is one of the few reliable sources of informed oversight on the larger drivers that I find worth looking at. He clearly has an intellectual interest in the subject and does a pretty good job at identifying the incoming changes to the industry (although this year I think he's missed the tangible effects of climate change which we're going to see as a rising cost from this point on). Overall, the drivers in this years predictions strike me as pretty solid but of course they're long-terms drivers: some land hard and more immediate, some take several years before the impacts can be felt and all you can do is develop your own strategy to respond to. In either case, its an interesting read for all authors.",1

749,"Hopeful, comforting fantasy readsI just finished The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison (and will be reviewing it soon!) and I realized it's been a while since I read anything that was so hopeful and cathartic. I've read plenty of books with happy endings, but none that are quite so explicitly about the power of being a kind, genuine person and trying to make the world a better place. It was incredibly refreshing and I was hoping I could get some ideas for books that are similar. Off the top of my head I can think of Becky Chambers and Terry Pratchett. Thanks!!",1
750,"I just finished the Licanius Trilogy and I have to talk about it. (Spoilers Marked) Must-read for anyone who loves a complex Epic Fantasy.With the recent release of the final Licanius novel in December, I decided it was finally time to consume the series.

I'm going to be honest: It took me until halfway through book two before I was committed. (Edit, to elaborate, not the book's fault, but I had just finished a tonally different fantasy series and wasn't really feeling such a jarring sub-genre change).

By the climax of the second book, I was sold and was convinced I would read anything James Islington published in the future. Before that, I wasn't even sure if I was going to finish it. But I had to stick with it and see if the payoff was worth it.

So, was it?

**Absolutely.** Those of you familiar with Brandon Sanderson are familiar with the absolute avalanche of information that is part of the Cosmere experience. I would say that *The Light of All That Falls* exceeds that feeling substantially. The plot is complex, the characters are consistent and the story is EXTREMELY tropey. But that ending. Rather, the last fifteen hours of the audiobook.

My advice is to read this series, treasure these characters and enjoy the ride, because it was beautiful.

Please mark spoilers in the comments.

&gt;!The Time travel was handled well, and I loved how Tal's story ended. The reveal of Davian's parentage was perfect, and the Zevalar reveal (being stuck in a time bubble while the city falls apart) were the highlights of the climax.!&lt;",1

753,"1st Gaunt's Ghost Omnibus on sale for £1.99 on amazon UK - normally £13.99Not read it yet but had it on my wish list for a while. Supposed to be pretty good.

754,"Does anyone else hate the “Magic Goes Away” trope?I don’t know if it’s just me, but I’m sick of fantasy settings where “magic is dissipating”, where humans are drying out magic or drowning out other races due to expansion. When I was younger, I thought simply, “oh no! That’s so awful, but interesting!!” However now it’s so blatantly overused that it seems more like a scapegoat to not use/explain magic or fantasy races. Things like the Witcher, where the Witchers are dying out and the elves are driven away, or the Good Hunting episode of Love, Death, and Robots, where magic/spirit magic dies out due to industry. I apologize for my rather lacking examples, as it’s about 1:30 AM right now, but I hope my question is clear.

Edit: I’m elated to see all these different opinions on my first real post, as well as excited at all these book/series recommendations! I should say though that my core point was my distaste for when Magic dying out is at the end of a story, and I see in rereading how I didn’t convey that as well as I could have (sorry, it was late!).",1
755,"What are heroes that you’re supposed to love but want to punch instead?That’s something I’m very sensitive about because for me a story succeed in grabbing me only if the characters are likable. They don’t need to be “good” or “bad” but they need to make me want to root for them.

But lately I’ve been reading more and more books that are fine in and on themselves, but I can’t manage to get into because the protagonists are so dull and insufferable that I don’t care at all if they live or if they die. So I decided to channel my frustration and made it a question for you instead.

What are the type of characters that you can’t stand in fiction?

For me, there are three kind:

- The whiner, the one that keep lamenting themselves about how unfair the world is. I don’t mind a little pathos but most of the time those characters are rarely proactive and there is often a much more competent cooler side character to guide and protect them.

- The chosen ones: I prefer people that beat the odds to the ones that are destined to win.

- The complete asshole. Some people root for the MC in a Clockwork Orange. I’m rooting instead for the people they rape or kill instead. The sooner they die the better.

What about you?",1
756,"Super geniuses, should they be major villains/characters? General (but not detailed) spoilers for the Flash, Long Earth Series, and Thrawn's battle methodology, inside.I just finished season 4 of the Flash and the entire season builds up the genius of DeVoe and how insanely amazing he is and how his final plan is beyond normal mental comprehension.  But basically he wants to build a big dumb ray and take over Earth and constantly forgets what emotions are.  That's like...  Kinda genius at best, and only because he can make specific superpowers appear.

In the Long Earth series a sub-species for super intelligent humans comes to light and they're constantly evolving language and grammar *even as they talk*.  But no examples are ever given just some ""Oh yea, they make new grammar as they talk, it's amazing, they're just way too smart for us!""

In Thrawn he automatically wins battles by looking at art, because you can predict everything about a species by its art.  Somehow.  Although I'm semi-curious what he'd say about Picasso.

Two of these are very hand-wavey intelligence and one of them is just....dumb.  I'm kind of the opinion that authors and creators should steer away from super-genius characters and subtypes unless they're very minor characters, because otherwise it all falls apart.  The genius character doesn't seem like a genius, just someone who's incredibly lucky.  Authors can't write someone more intelligent than themselves, so to write a super genius you'd have to be a super genius.  Which... would be super awesome and I would totally read that book, but I've never seen this done well.  

I'm not saying something should **never** be done, but I think authors and writers in general should be a lot more wary of the super-genius character.",1

758,"Thoughts on female writer dominant Goodreads choice awards in the fantasy genreI've been checking the goodreads choice awards and I've noticed that the majority of books there (13/20) are from female writers. Most of the top places are taken by women and 5 of the 7 men are in the bottom 6 places (from the 20). With only GRRM in third places and Marlon James in 9th.

I've always thought that there was some discrimination against female authors, is this a sign that our genre grew out of those prejudices? How prevalent was this discrimination to begin with ? 
Do you think people are consciously trying to support women to fight the discrimination or is this just a natural consequence of readers being less prejudiced?

[Note: this post can also be viewed (with cover images and updated formatting) on our blog.](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/blog/2020/01/02/2019-year-in-review-booktackular/)

Pull up a chair and warm yourself by the hearth, good traveler! The day is late, and we’ve all journeyed from afar to get here. Our voyages over the past year has carved many a winding path through the vast fields of genre fiction; some roads have been recognizable, and others were unfamiliar and untrodden. This is why I’m going to do things a bit differently this year. Instead of a single list of Top 2019 Reads, I’m splitting it up into two categories:

**– Favorite Traditional Published Books of 2019**; and  
– **This Year’s Hidden Gems**

Let me first clarify that I don’t think that traditionally published books should be categorized or judged on a different scale than self- or independently-published books. I have read over eighty books this year, and I think we’re in a golden age of fantasy writing worldwide. Creativity, exploration, inclusion, and brilliant storytelling are consistently setting new precedents, regardless of the author’s background or marketing support. The goal here is to applaud the flat-out incredible range of popular SFF books I’ve read in 2019, while also calling attention to some of the more underground, underrated, or less talked-about gems that I think deserve a bigger audience.

# Favorite Traditional Published Books of 2019

The following list contains wide-release books I read in 2019. Not all have been published in 2019; some will be released in 2020. They are unranked, but if I were to rank them, the group at the top of the list would be listed the highest. (At least, today they are. Ask me again tomorrow, and the order might change. And this is why they’re unranked.) Much has been said about many of these books already—I’ve included links to my full reviews of each one—so I’ll keep my additional comments to a minimum. Without further ado…

**The Hod King**, by Josiah Bancroft  
The third book in Bancroft’s *The Books of Babel* tetraology solidifies this series as a generational classic in the making. Hot on the trail of finding his lost love, Thomas and his crew are catapulted further into the mysteries of the Tower as it starts to crumble under the strains of populist strife. Poetic prose, clever humor, heartfelt character connections, and wondrous mysteries abound. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Josiah-Bancroft/The-Hod-King.html)

**The Unspoken Name**, by A. K. Larkwood  
One of the best debut novels I’ve read, full stop. A genre-defying story of hidden gods, trans-dimensional portals, priestess-turned-assassins, thievery, artifact-hunting, sky ships, ancient myths… there is so much story packed into this one novel, it feels like you’re reading a full series by book’s end. If the gods are just, this book will have a massive reception upon release. It’s a truly remarkable achievement. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/A-K-Larkwood/The-Unspoken-Name.html)

**A Brightness Long Ago**, by Guy Gavriel Kay  
Perhaps the finest work of one of the world’s greatest living storytellers; *Brightness* examines the ramifications of decisions made by fringe players of historic events that reshape the world. A historical fantasy based on soldiers and leaders in medieval Italy, the characters are as beautiful and rich as Kay’s prose. Stunning set pieces, with soaring emotional highs and devastating moments of loss. Vintage Kay at the top of his game. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Guy-Gavriel-Kay/A-Brightness-Long-Ago.html)

**The Ten Thousand Doors of January**, by Alix Harrow  
A beautifully written and lovingly crafted adventure about the strength of love, the importance of stories, and the timeless power of words. This is a book that will reward repeat readers. Exquisite and unforgettable. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Alix-E-Harrow/The-10000-Doors-of-January.html)

**Master of Sorrows**, by Justin Call  
Another brilliant coming-of-age debut about a half-priest, half-warrior boy who is destined to become The Dark One. The world-building echoes Brandon Sanderson in terms of depth and breadth. A doorbuster of a book that covers a very short period of time; it’s plain to see that we’ve barely begun to scratch the surface of the world that Call has planned for us. Immersive and unputdownable. [Full Review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Justin-Call/Master-of-Sorrows.html)

**The Girl and the Stars**, by Mark Lawrence  
A new trilogy set in Abeth, taking place centuries after the Book of the Ancestor series has ended. A brilliant introduction to another genre-defying trilogy set far beneath the ice planet’s surface, with hints suggesting how all Lawrence’s books are tied together. A fascinating and full-realized world that seamlessly blends fantasy and tech with a protagonist you’ll root for from the start. Once again, Lawrence one-ups himself with each release. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Mark-Lawrence/The-Girl-And-The-Stars.html)

**The Ninth House**, by Leigh Bardugo  
Bardugo’s first foray into adult fantasy explores hidden societies beneath the surface of Yale University, told through the eyes of a survivor of a mass murder who can see ghosts. Mysteries, magic, and shocking reveals aplenty, with Bardugo’s wonderful prose and deeply flawed characters helping to make this a haunting, cant-miss read. Haunting and original. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Leigh-Bardugo/Ninth-House.html)

**Holy Sister**, by Mark Lawrence  
A devastating yet triumphant end to Nona’s story in the final entry of the Book of the Ancestor trilogy. A clever narrative structure keeps the tension high, and the fates of all our favorite nuns and their encroaching enemies are determined. Emotional, surprising, and unmissable. Nona will be missed. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Mark-Lawrence/Holy-Sister.html)

**The True Bastards**, by Jonathan French  
Fetch was my favorite character in *The Grey Bastards* so I have been waiting years to read this sequel after learning she would be the main POV. It did not disappoint. It is a pulse-pounding story of sacrifice and survival, of rising above persectuion, and the strengths of brotherhood no matter your background… and enough violence, profanity, and black comedy to whet even the darkest of appetites. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Jonathan-French/The-True-Bastards.html)

**Darkdawn**, by Jay Kristoff  
Mia “Murderqueen” Corvere’s story comes to an end in a blood-soaked, tear-fueled rage of death, love, stabbings, more death, all the the vengeful showdowns we had been promised, and enough surprises to make physically unable put the book down over the last hundred pages. (I’ve tried it. Don’t question it, it’s science.) It also provides plenty of Kristoff’s irreverant humor as well as poignant commentary on the power of words over weapons. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Jay-Kristoff/Darkdawn.html)

**Dispel Illustion**, by Mark Lawrence  
When a trilogy deals with time travel, quantum physics, closing loops, ‘rules of a branching multiverse,’ and, oh yes, cancer, D&amp;D, nostalgia, and a touching love story, one would think that it would be impossible to pull off a fitting finale. One would also learn to never underestimate Mark Lawrence’s skill in covering all his bases while delivering a clever and satisfying finish that hits all the right notes. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Mark-Lawrence/Dispel-Illusion.html)

**The Dragon Republic**, by R. F. Kuang  
In the follow-up to the shocking and unforgettable *The Poppy War*, Kuang manages to deliver this sequel with improved focus and a more balanced tone, but still delivering on Rin’s hellish coming-of-age journey through a war-torn world of havoc and survival. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/R-F-Kuang/The-Dragon-Republic.html)

**Priest of Lies**, by Peter McLean  
After reading *Priest of Bones* and *Priest of Lies* back-to-back, Tomas Piety overtook the voice in my head. I started to think like him, to talk and respond like him. That is how well-crafted a character he is, and how in control McLean is in delivering such a unique narrative voice through his stories. Piety is an ex-soldier-turned-gang leader who is leading his former platoon mates in a takeover of his old city, but there are plenty of rivals standing in his way. And some people you just don’t mess with. ‘Addictive’ doesn’t begin to describe these books. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Peter-McLean/Priest-of-Lies.html)

**Bloody Rose**, by Nicholas Eames  
Book two of The Band changes its focus from metaphoric 1970’s classic rock debauchery to a 1980’s-inspired band of mercenaries led by femme fatale Bloody Rose, daughter of *Kings of the Wyld*‘s Golden Gabe. The story is told from Tam’s POV, the newest member of Rose’s band Fable, as she navigates the highs and lows of tour life. Humor is intercut with heart and heartbreak, with plenty of action and a rousing finale. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Nicholas-Eames/Bloody-Rose.html)

**The Sin in the Steel**, by Ryan Van Loan  
Debuting in 2020. Buc is a teenage genius. Part Alexander Hamilton, part Sherlock Holmes, she and her traumatized soldier companion are commissioned by a massive corporation to discover why their trading ships are disappearing at sea. Ancient gods? Pirates? Politics and mad mages? It’s a foul-mouthed, swashbuckling, double-crossing adventure not to be missed. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Ryan-Van-Loan/The-Sin-In-The-Steel.html)

**Starsight**, by Brandon Sanderson  
How does he keep doing it? Sanderson’s first foray into outer space science-fiction was a knockout in *Skyward*. Exceptional world-building, an original ‘magic’ (cytonic) system, plenty of mystery, and likeable protagonists — all Sanderson staples. In this sequel, Spin is forced out of her comfort zone to confront who she really is, and find out her place in the universe. As new alien races and threats are introduced, Sanderson has the chance to use the farthest reaches of the universe as his sandbox, and he takes full advantage of this opportunity to create fascinating societies, life forms, and forces of destruction to contend with. The creativity is turned up to eleven. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Brandon-Sanderson/Starsight.html)

# This Year’s Hidden Gems

Fantasy fiction has an incredible online fan community. Countless blogs, Facebook groups, Discords, reddit pages, and Twitter conversations are daily evidence that there is a positive and supportive system between authors, fans, and publishers. Word of mouth might be the single most powerful tool we have to promote the new and exciting stories that are being loosed into the aether. While some titles that have little difficulty picking up new audiences, others could greatly benefit from online buzz to help gain traction. I like to call these books ‘hidden gems;’ some books you might know quite well, and perhaps have already read more than a few, but I encourage you to pick up a couple of new ones to read in 2020.

Not all of the following books were published this year, but since I read them in 2019, they are eligible for this list. Many of these stories appealed to me for many different reasons, so I’ll try and be as specific and concise as possible in sharing why I think these are also some of the best reads of the year.

**The Millennial Manifesto**, by Michael R. Fletcher  
A powerful tale on what some resourceful, fearless, and determined young people can do when they’re fed up with the atrocities of the world that’s being turned over to them. A generational call-to-arms. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Michael-R-Fletcher/The-Millennial-Manifesto.html)

**River of Thieves**, by Clayton Snyder  
Sharply written and utterly hilarious, this story of some take-no-prisoners vigilantes feels like a middle-finger response to the shameful and depressing state of government and the cartoonishly idiotic dipthongs that pretend to run things. The fantastic dialogue shines. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Clayton-Snyder/River-Of-Thieves.html)

**Legacy of Ghosts**, by Alicia Wanstall-Burke  
Wanstall-Burke’s *Blood of Heirs* is a SPFBO5 finalist for good reason, but *Legacy of Ghosts* is where the story really launches it into uncharted territory. Strong character development, exciting set pieces, and intense showdowns aplenty. The wait for book three is going to be a long one. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Alicia-Wanstall-Burke/Legacy-Of-Ghosts.html)

**The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in the Water**, by Zen Cho  
What starts out as a book about banditry and border wars becomes a meditation on identity, and how its ramifications affect different races, customs, and lands. A novella that runs the full gamut of emotions, with an excellent payoff and solid foundational world-building for Cho’s other works. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Zen-Cho/The-Order-Of-The-Pure-Moon-Reflected-In-The-Water.html)

**Wrath of Storms**, by Steve McKinnon  
What *Symphony of the Wind* brings to the table, *Wrath of Storms* dials it up across the board. This series feels like a fantasy Die Hard mashup, but now we’re going to add Tomb Raider and 007 films into the mix. In other words, you can count on more incredible action sequences, a breathless pace, characters you love to hate and hate to love, and pure, adrenaline-fueled fun. The lore runs rich and the emotional stakes grow deeper, and McKinnon can’t write these fast enough. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-McKinnon/Wrath-Of-Storms.html)

**The Girl with No Face**, by M. H. Boroson  
Fantasy, horror, action, spirituality, religion, deep character growth, and sheer wonder, set in Chinatown pre-20th century San Francisco. Spirit healers, evil yokai, dazzling swordfights, and something called a ‘love spell’ that will give you nightmares. This is an incredibly underrated series with a vividly-realized narrative voice. Li-Lin is someone you’ll root for and want to spend time with again and again. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/M-H-Boroson/The-Girl-With-No-Face.html)

**Never Die**, by Rob J. Hayes  
An adrenaline-fueled, anime-inspired story of vengeance, exploring what it means to be a warrior, and what tolls it might take on the human psyche.  A deceased boy gathers a troupe of  infamous, X-Men -style warriors to take down the man who killed him. But they’ll have to contend with *yokai,* Japanese spirit monsters of legend, if they want to survive. Non-stop action, a great mix of ‘let’s get a team together!’ scenes, strong characterizations for such a short one-off novel, and plenty of surprises by the end. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Rob-J-Hayes/Never-Die.html)

**Borderlands: Prelude**, by Charles Gull  
Gull introduces two vast kingdoms at war in his *Borderlands* series of novellas, with each subsequent book centering on a different protagonist while continuing the same story line.  This intense military fantasy offers plenty of unique monsters, environmental dangers that call to mind McDonald’s ‘The Misery,’ and a long string of action scenes and world-building developments that establishes what’s to come in the many planned books ahead. [Full review](https://reedsy.com/discovery/book/prelude-borderlands-book-0-charles-gull)

**Bloodwitch**, by Timandra Whitecastle  
A prequel to the Living Blade trilogy, *Bloodwitch* introduces some of the major players and their origins, and how what we already know of them might be misconstrued. Whitecastle utilizes her articulate prose to weave wondrous scenes of water-magic and high-stakes adventure. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Timandra-Whitecastle/Bloodwitch.html)

**Zed**, by Joanna Kavenna  
George Orwell meets *Black Mirror*. A satirical, hilarious, and downright frightening near-future science fiction story about an omnipresent tech company who grows so powerful that they influence law, economy, and just about everything else on the planet. Their “Beetle” network is like Alexa or Siri on steriods. Many potshots are fired, and nearly all of them land. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Joanna-Kavenna/Zed.html)

**Sin Eater**, by Mike Shel  
The second entry in Shel’s ‘Iconoclasts’ trilogy solidifes him as one of the brightnest new talents in fantasy novel writing. Shel has many years’ experience writing for RPGs, and he utilizes these tools to develop a harrowing tale of elder gods, ancient races, dungeon crawls, magic weapons, and an absolute killer of an ending. But the book truly excels when the relationship between Auric and his daughter Agnes is put under the spotlight. Rich and rewarding, with deeply flawed characters and an escalating intensity, the third book is one of my most anticipated of 2020. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Mike-Shel/Sin-Eater.html)

**Legends of the Exiles**, by Jesse Teller  
Teller continues to flesh out his ambitious, gargantuan world of Perilisc with bi-annual releases that span continents and generations, further cementing Teller as one of the most imaginative and driven writers out there. *Legends* is comprised of four powerful novellas, with four different women as each story’s lead, overcoming great burdens in a generally male-centric society. (Although *Daughter of Beasts* may beg to differ.) This is also a deeply personal story for Teller to write, and he has since bravely shared some of his own past experiences that mirror some of the horrifying and tragic events in the book. While not all aspects of these stories clicked for me, I’m still thinking about them many months later. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Jesse-Teller/Legends-of-the-Exiles.html)

**The Glass Dagger**, by M. D. Presley  
This criminally underread series continues to astound with its complex themes, time-shifting dual narratives, an inherent magic system based on breath, politics, manhunts, sorcery, steampunk and flintlock fantasy elements, and a fully-realized world loosely based on Civil War-era America. Book three of the series sets up what should be an incredible finale, due out this year.

**Son of a Liche**, by J. Zachary Pike  
Pike’s first entry in The Dark Profit saga, *Orconomics*, won first place out of 300 entries in a self-published fantasy contest for good reason. It’s refreshingly original, absolutely hilarious, poignant, and reflective of our current state of late-stage capitlaism. *Son of a Liche* somehow ups the ante in almost every aspect, delivering an endlessly quotable deluge of smart, incisive commentary, trope subversion, and masterful, rhythmic prose that flows like a long verse of Bill Hicks’ dark poetry. It also manages to pull heavily on the heartstrings, delivering a sneaky and surprising amount of well-developed character depth. This book impresses on so many levels. A must-read.

**Kings of Ash**, by Richard Nell  
Nell’s *Kings of Paradise* blew me away, instantly becoming one of my favorite debuts, and books, of all time. *Kings of Ash* sneers at *Kings of Paradise* on its way to dethroning the former champion. Ruka is the most interesting character in all the fantasy I’ve consumed over the years, and this trilogy is a character study of what this broken and hated boy is capable of when he grows up to a be feared, charismatic barbarian with multiple personas, an eidetic memory, his own skewed sense of morality, and a thirst for conquest and vengeance. As if that wasn’t enough, Ruka discovers some hidden traits about his mind grove that is jaw-dropping in its awesomeness and its consequences. Nell is a truly amazing talent, and it is only a matter of time before this trilogy is picked up by a wide-releasing publisher.

**The Shadow King**, by Alec Hutson  
The Raveling trilogy is a throwback, classical epic fantasy story that is smartly plotted and tightly written, with a deep well of rich lore and detailed world-building that draws on both eastern and western cultures. It is also an extremely polished work, and would fit perfectly in the bookshelves of any fantasy enthusiast. *The Shadow King* concludes what is a truly thrilling adventure that will have you both pumping your fist and grimacing with anticipation. Although the trilogy may be over, I hope we’ll see a lot more of this world. Either way, anything Hutson writes is a first-day purchase.

**To Flee a King**, by Steve Rodgers  
Releasing in 2020. I was privy to an early draft of Rodgers’ third book of his Spellgiver series, and it was by far my favorite of the three. And this is after choosing [City of Shards](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steve-Rodgers/City-of-Shards.html) as a semi-finalist in SPFBO4. *To Flee a King* is another masterclass in world-building, showcasing one of Rodgers’ greatest aspects as a writer. While we once again shift between a few POVs, the Lidathi general Kemharak’s story is at the forefront as he tries to lead his people out of the frozen north and find a place of safety to settle amongst a world that has been taught to hate his race. Rodgers impresses in not only imagining a dearth of original ideas on how his world functions, but also at how deeply he considers how each of his creative decisions interact and evolve within the societies and environments he has built around them. This is one of the many reasons why the Spellgiver series separates itself from other epic fantasies of its kind. 

**Flight of the Darkstar Dragon**, by Benedict Patrick  
A clever twist on portal fantasy, Patrick launches the first of a new series outside of his Yarnsworld universe. An airship is pulled through a doorway into a closed dimension of countless portals of shifting doors that open and close, leading to indescribable new worlds. Min attempts to lead her trapped airship crew back home, but must contend with a power-hungry wizard, environmental hazards, and, oh yes, a planet-sized dragon. Gaining the respect of her crewmates would be a good start. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Benedict-Patrick/Flight-of-the-Darkstar-Dragon.html)

**Faycalibur**, by Liam Perrin  
Perrin once again goes against the grain in delivering a Python-esque, Pratchett-inspired take on the Knights of the Round, told from the perspective of Sir Thomas the Hesitant of the Less Valued Knights. (If certain texts were to be believed, then yes, the Less Valued Knights actually existed.) This series continues its warm-hearted adventures filled with wit and optimism, which sound like a perfect escapist antidote to the dreary state of current world events. This story shows signs that Perrin has a long game in mind for Thomas and his crew. A delightful read. [Full review](https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Liam-Perrin/Faycalibur.html)

760,"The Way of Kings: When does the plot kick in?I’ve recently started reading the Way of Kings (currently at chapter 4). I know it’s still too early, but I wonder when does the plot kick in?

The book starts off very descriptive and I’m fine with it. It’s just too difficult to understand what’s the story here. Can someone maybe give me a non-spoiler general overview of the plot?

Thanks!",1

In 2020, I'm starting with the next two Prince of Nothing novels.  Are there any novels that you think I absolutely need to pick up based on the above?  Thanks, and Happy New Year!",1
762,"Best sites to buy fantasy books online?I used to buy on amazon, but some books on there are like 50 dollars for no real reason",1
763,"Was wondering if you can still get The Way of Kings UK edition that isn’t split into two partsI’ve seen it in some old videos about the book, but I’ve been looking and can’t find it anywhere. And I’m also curious if they did that with Words of Radiance and Oathbringer.",1
764,"Rereading the Night Angel trilogy by Brent WeeksLike the title says I’m rereading them. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I read them maybe five years ago and remembered loving them (even if hey are a tad bit... awkward) but what I distinctly remember is not enjoyed book 2, “Shadows Edge”. Well I just finished it (book 2) and just wanted to get some stuff of my chest. Spoilers below.

It’s a book that’s so close to being so damn good but there’s parts that just really bring the whole thing down a couple levels. First things first is &gt;!Kylar and Elene’s romance!&lt;. I get what Weeks was going for with the entire &gt;!he’s not actually in love with her, just the idea of her!&lt; but that isn’t really developed by much more than reader intuition until you get to the third book (IIRC). This makes Elene seem so impossibly naive at times that I found myself rolling my eyes, and it doesn’t seem like there’s enough done to fuel Kylar’s growing disdain. A lot of people say they got bored of Kylar/Elene chapters, and I get it, but the dynamic between the two wasn’t explored in great detail, and I think that’s why those bits suffer. 

But the climax. Holy lord the climax almost made me stop reading the book for the rest of the day. Rest is spoilers, be warned if you wanna read the series. &gt;! When Kylar and Vi get to the throne room and confront Garoth, Garoth literally throws out a “No, I am your father” line and in the most awkward response Kylar just says “WHAT?!” and the very next sentence Garoth pretty much says “lol jk” and at the end of the chapter Kylar gives the most strangely delivered cliche “I’m just getting warmed up” line. This whole bit then really, REALLY cheapens the truth that in fact Vi is his offspring. What? Why the weird “gotcha” moment? It seems like Weeks just wanted a nod to Star Wars, and could’ve simply delivered it to Vi instead of this awkward cringey mess that was that chapter. I was blown away because Weeks is a damn good writer (IMO) and the quality here (in the climax!) just drops off a cliff. Further, it seems like such a copy paste of the first books climax. The first books climax was “defeat an impossible enemy and kill the prince of Khalidor in the Cenarian throne room”. The climax of this book is the EXACT same, just replace ‘prince’ with king. The whole climax just seemed so off with not only the rest of the book(s) but also with authorial skill.!&lt;

That’s all I had to say. All in all I still recommend the series as a whole, definitely at least the first book, because if you don’t like the first you probably won’t have the willpower to get through the second. Third is great too. 

TL;DR Shadows Edge is almost a really great book but it’s few shortcomings bring down a great deal of quality, notably in Kylar/Elene character development and an exceedingly awkward and oddly written climax.",1
765,"Protagonists who are crazy if you read between the linesLots of protagonists go through some pretty horrific things...some authors seem rather gleeful about torturing protagonists.

Is it worth a read? Might just get the first book and judge for myself.",1
768,"One Mike to Review Them All - The Book of Koli by MR Carey (contains minor spoilers)MR Carey, aka Mike Carey, has been one of my favorite writers for years. His *Lucifer* spinoff from Gaiman’s *Sandman* is incredible. His time writing *Hellblazer* was great. I consider the Felix Castor urban fantasy series to be every bit as good as Dresden, and *The Girl with all the Gifts* deserves all the praise it gets. Getting an ARC of Carey’s forthcoming book is without doubt the highlight of my book reviewing career. So a huge thank-you to Orbit for this book.

So, does this book live up to my expectations? On the whole, yes it does.

This is a post-apocalyptic book. Climate change and other environmental disasters have pretty much wrecked the human population, with the added fun that poorly conceived genetic experiments run amok have made trees carnivorous and in general turned nature hyperaggressive. “*The Fifth Season*, but with biology trying to kill everyone instead of geology” isn’t a bad description. Koli is from one small, primitive, isolated village (which describes how most of humanity is living), on the edge between childhood and adulthood. The time before everything fell apart is shrouded in myth and legend. Surviving functional technology is both priceless and completely-not-understood, and the leadership of the village is chosen due to their ability to use the tech the village depends on to survive.

The fact that the only people who can use the village’s technology come from one family is probably just a coincidence.

I don’t think it’s really a spoiler to say that Koli eventually manages to get his hands on a working piece of tech, and things don’t turn out the way he hopes. Normally I wouldn’t mention that (even though it’s really obvious where the story is going) but there was no way to avoid mentioning that without mentioning the greatest part of the book: the device’s user interface is modeled on a manufactured, hyper-peppy Japanese pop idol. Koli has no idea what to make of this girl (and as far as he’s aware, it’s not a UI, it’s some kind of a magical spirit girl living inside the old tech that keeps asking him what his favorite songs are). And it is awesome.

As far as critiques go, my only serious one is that the opening is slow. I enjoyed it, because Carey is a good writer, but the pacing is kind of sedate for the first half of the book or so (the second half makes up for it). And there were some parts (particularly involving the wise sage character, a.k.a. the only person in the book who actually knows anything real about the old world) where I thought Koli got answers far too easily.

But those (minor) complaints aside, this was a super interesting book, and a super fun one. I’m very much looking forward to the sequel.",1

772,"Help finding a long lost slice of life fantasy webcomic.i've been trying to track down a fantasy webcomic i read about in an article years ago and was hoping this reddit could help.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a High fantasy / D&amp;D / slice of life  webcomic with a quiet, relaxed, contemplative vibe. The main character was some sort of hobbit/halfling mage and seemed to be travelling in a caravan.

The only comic i remember is the main character halfling talking with a travel companion about how their magic differed. The travel  companion could create fire very easily but the halfling's magic was different. He explained his magic was all about encouraging things, he couldn't start a fire, but he could make a small fire grow and spread and consume a countryside.

that's all i remember, the art was more cartoony in terms of proportions, but still nicely illustrated.

774,"Review - Amatka by Karin TidbeckVanja arrives in Amatka to research the colony's interest in a new variety of soap. She finds a cold, repressive, miserable town surrounded by tundra where the people seem to have more on their minds than washing. Because in Vanja's world, everything new is impermanent -- to help objects keep their shape people are required to regularly name each object they own, either by writing or their voice -- and the Committee are prepared to do anything to stop the order they have created dissolving. 

I read this book quite soon after *The Memory Police* by Yoko Ogawa and it's hard not to compare the two books: both are set in dystopian police states and really explore the full ramifications of a fantastical concept, from the banal everyday consequences to the truly Weird places the narrative ends up when this concept is pushed to its logical, messed up conclusion.

Tidbeck builds the world of Amatka really subtly, with hints and character bias rather than straight exposition. You can tell the author thought through how people's lives would be affected by the need to constantly reinforce the world through language, and the society she shows us is eminently believable. One thing that I found unique is that although the 'Committee' is coded as the same generic evil we've seen from a hundred other dystopian novels, a step back to think about the situation is enough to wonder: are they truly in the wrong? I enjoyed this ambiguity greatly.

My only criticism is that things in happened a little too quickly. Events could have been stretched out over a few more weeks, if only to give poor Vanja some more time to sleep! I also would have appreciated a little more self-reflection from Vanja on why exactly she was doing what she was doing as I was struggling to parse her motivations at times.

Overall, a really enjoyable novel - well worth the read for people who enjoy weird fiction or novels where concepts are pushed to their absolute limits.  For fans of the *Area X Trilogy* by Jeff Vandermeer and *Embassytown* by China Mieville.",1

I was thinking about *Discworld*, of which I know next to nothing.

To more experienced readers, do you think it fits the bill?

Where to start? I know there are some subseries within Discworld? Is there one that stands out? Perhaps the Watch or Death novels?

Otherwise, what else would you recommend (comedy sci-fi also welcome)?

I specifically recall all the living creatures, including insects, retreating into some protected area as the bad guys eat souls or something of the sort.

779,"To cope with my Dad's passing, I challenged myself to read a chapter every day in 2019. Here are the results!Hi, I have a physical disability called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) which is a muscular disease that prevents muscle growth as time progresses; very similar to ALS. Throughout my whole life, I depended on care from my family, especially my Dad. In October of 2018, he passed away from stage-four liver cancer. It was a huge blow to my family, and to try and desperately find some sort of relief, I decided to try and read a chapter from a book every day, and if I missed a day, I would make up for it the next session.

This might not seem like a challenge to a lot of you, but I was never an avid reader. throughout my life (currently in my 20's) I had probably read and completed less than 7 books, so I wanted to get into the habit of reading every day to see how many books I can finish in a year! Here's what I read:

* Warbreaker, Brandon Sanderson (12/30-1/17) - 7/10

* Neuromancer, William Gibson (1/18-2/6) - 5/10

* Red Rising, (Red Rising #1), Pierce Brown (2/7-3/10) - 8.5/10

* Pachinko, Min Jin Lee (3/11-4/30) - 7/10

* How to American: An Immigrant's Guide to Disappointing Your Parents, Jimmy O. Yang - (4/20-4/26) - 7/10

* Words of Radiance, (Stormlight Archive #2), Brandon Sanderson - (5/1-7/20) - 9.5/10

* The Martian, Andy Weir - (7/21-8/8) - 9/10

* Tuesdays with Morrie, Mitch Albom - (8/9-8/19) - 9/10

* Golden Son, (Red Rising #2), Pierce Brown - (8/20-9/21) - 9/10

* Edgedancer, (Stormlight Archive #2.5), Brandon Sanderson - (9/22-10/7) - 7.5/10

* Morning Star, (Red Rising #3), Pierce Brown - (10/8-11/8) - 8.5/10

* So You've Been Publicly Shamed, Jon Ronson - (11/9-11/22) - 7/10

* The Sympathizer, Viet Thanh Nguyen - (11/23-sometime 2020)

* The Blade Itself, (The First Law Trilogy #1), Joe Abercrombie - (12/11-sometime 2020)

Few things: I know a few of these aren't fantasy, and I kind of cheated a little bit by starting a couple of days early and ended a little later, but I wanted to be honest and transparent about this. These ratings are based purely on my enjoyment of these, as well as the impact it had on me, whether emotional or philosophical. Also, Way of Kings (Stormlight Archive #1) was the book I completed right before starting Warbreaker and if I were to give it a rating, it would be an 8.5.

Overall, reading has been a great way to cope with my Dad's loss, because it is an escape for me when times get rough. Having SMA, my hobbies are somewhat limited because of the physical impairment but I'm really grateful to have books as a part of my life going forward.

The other books I've finished the other years include the His Dark Materials series (that I love and adore), the first Ender's Game, and The Alchemist. If you have suggestions on what to read next, please let me know! Brandon Sanderson is my current favorite author. I am also willing to give my thoughts on these books if people are interested! I have to admit, I'm proud of myself for this, and I think my Dad would be too.",1

781,"Which emerging or little-known book did you read, love and believe will be amongst the best in fantasy in 5 years' time? What about this book convinces you of the notion?Notwithstanding your thinking about these books: I'm sure there are people on this sub, that read Mistborn, The name of the wind, First law trilogy, etc. when they had less than 300 reviews on Goodreads, saw something special about them and went out of their way to recommend and promote the books.

Also, every cycle, there are certain new books that stand out of the pack, get wide mentions across several platforms and while some of these books fizzle out after sometime because of several circumstances, others endure and carve a niche for themselves in the genre.

So what emerging books do you think can weather the storm of scrutiny and emerge as amongst the best in the genre in 5 years' time?",1
782,"Review - A Magical Inheritance by Krista D BallTurns out, I love regency fantasy. A Magical Inheritance was witty and delightful to read, I loved the geeking out over books, the fantasy of manners style, and the great characters. We might all moan about the size of our TBRs, but Miss Knight’s doesn’t even fit in her house. 

I can see how someone might expect a book where the entire plot revolves around cataloging, storing and occasionally selling books, and counting pennies while worrying about the condition of women in regency England, to be a little slow or boring. Not for me, I love that stuff! Sure it’s no action adventure, but all the great, and some of the horrible, characters and relationships meant I could barely put it down, I’m very much looking forward to the sequel. And I swear I want to punch that one guy so much, gah, that guy. 

I really liked how the story shows both very good and very bad relationships. Apart from her aunt and uncle Elizabeth’s relationship with her family is bad, with her father being particularly loathsome, though her sister and cousin are awfully self centered too. On the other hand is her very competent badass aunt, and her found family, the lovely and supportive Maria and husband Henry, as well as the other women who come to form The Ladies Occult Society. Of course I can’t mention characters without the awesome book ghost, a good no-nonsense woman. 

Although it started off grimly reminding me that fantasizing about fancy dresses is all well and good, but having been born in another era as anything but a rich man isn’t dreamy at all, I found A Magical Inheritance hopeful. Despite being dismissed, threatened and attacked by the men of Royal Occult Society, and getting no support from her father, Elizabeth uses her very practical and sensible nature to succeed, with a group of other like minded intelligent competent women. 

I highlighted a lot of passages in this book, but I leave you with my favorite: 

&gt;*“There comes a point in every woman’s life where she must accept if she is indeed the smartest person in the room or not. I have accepted that I am, present company excluded, of course, one of the most intelligent people in any room. And since that will never be acknowledged by the world, I refuse to hide my candle under a bushel, to use the holy words of the bible.”*

783,"Is The Witcher (novel series) well written?I'm.not sure if something is going straight over my head, but after 3 tense changes in chapter 1, and 4 instances of immediate repetition (his eyes were strange. Very strange; she was afraid. Very afraid; etc) on one page, I had to put it down. 

I really want to love it. I've just finished the tv series and loved the world and characters. Should I keep going?",1
784,"Does anyone feel like the writing quality significantly degrades around the third part of Powder Mage trilogy?I'm halfway through ""The Autumn Republic"" and I can't help but read it with one eye closed. Tons of forced exposition and the writing, which had me hooked throughout the two previous books, seems to lose all of its wit and charm.

This month we're reading [Mid-Lich Crisis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45822382-mid-lich-crisis) by Steve Thomas.

&gt;Is trying to sacrifice your estranged wife to a bloodthirsty demon an irredeemable act of evil? This is the sort of question the Dread Wizard Darruk Darkbringer struggles with. After being called evil one too many times, Darruk sets off to find a new purpose in his life and become a beloved celebrity. Can a dark wizard come to terms with himself and prove to the world that a few atrocities don’t define who he is? You’ll feel guilty for laughing at his twisted tale of self-discovery.

**Bingo Squares**: Self-published, SFF Novel by a Local to You Author (somewhere, no idea where?), SFF Novel Published in 2019, Any r/fantasy Book Club Book of the Month OR r/fantasy Read-along Book, 

We'll have our midway discussion post on January 10th and a final discussion near the end of the month (January 24th). I hope you decide to join us, looking forward to reading and discussing!

787,"Your top 10 favorite fantasy authors and top 10 metal bands?(if you a metalhead)I listen a lot of different kind of music, and read a lot of different kinds of books. But SFF novels and metal bands are the ones I get the most obsessed with. And I guessing I'm not the only one.

I'm sure I'm leaving out a few. There are so many amazing authors and bands out there.",1
788,"Mortal Engines - What is the reason for the moving cities?I understand that answering this may cause spoilers, that's why I used the ""Spoiler"" flair.

I've only seen the movie and have no real intention of ever reading the books, but I was curious as to why the cities were mobile in the first place. Moving cities at all is some crazy fantasy/sci-fi stuff, which I love, but I was hoping for some really cool in-universe explanation for why the cities were mobile (that was the whole reason I even watched the movie). Unfortunately, the movie didn't really answer this question.  I was wondering if the books shed any more light on the situation (or maybe it *was* in the movie and I just missed it).",1

790,"“Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep” Are there books where the people do mourn the villain?“Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep. No one lights a candle to remember. No, no one mourns at all, when they lay them down to sleep.” Is a quote from the lyrics of the song Requiem in the musical Dear Evan Hansen. But I was thinking about it the other day and was wondering if there are stories where people do weep, or mourn the loss of the villain? 

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations? It could be because we find out that they were good after all? Or it could be because the loss while good, the community is misguided and thinks its bad. Or anything in between. Does this lyric bring any books to mind in any shape or form. 

Thanks ya’ll, happy new year, and mark your spoilers appropriately!",1
791,"S/O to Brent Weeks for showing some representations of lesser known issues in his Lightbeinger seriesI read the Lightbringer series this last month, and I loved it, but what really struck me was his representation of some lesser known issues. The first one that I see a lot of people mention is Vaginismus. A character in one of the books is dealing with it and it shows how it can affect a relationship, but also how it can make one stronger. It was something I had never heard of, and am now aware of. 

The one that most people probably overlooked, but really struck home with me because I suffer from it is when some of the characters were discussing 'shy bladders'. I suffer from this and it is very real. It is where it's hard to go to the bathroom when other people are around. I used to be an opiate addict and my shy bladder kind of grew from that and progressed. At one point I had to go the ER twice because I just couldnt go. It was so bad if anyone was even in the house I couldn't go. Over the years it has gotten extremely better and doesnt affect me much anymore, but just hearing it discussed in such an amazing series really made me feel good. Before I felt like I was the only person who had it, and nobody understood, but that really made me feel like im not alone and other people know it's a real issue. 

I just wanted to pay my respects to Brent Weeks, your words are entertaining, but they can also really help make people feel better about themselves.",1

Here's the rankings for all the books I read in 2019. Spoilers!(Obviously)

My Favorites of the Year

* [**Lincoln in the Bardo** by George Saunders](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/11/lincoln-in-the-bardo-by-george-saunders/)
   * What a gloriously weird book. The author took liberties with style, telling a story American Civil-War era ghosts.
   * Reading this was a trip, both a trip back in time and a mind-bending acid trip.
* [**Tigana** by Guy Gavriel Kay](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/18/tigana-by-guy-gavriel-kay/)
   * First book by Kay I've read and it was excellent.
* [**This is How You Lose the Time** War by Amal El-Mohar and Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/07/22/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war-by-amal-el-mohtar-and-max-gladstone/)
   * I liked this so much I read it twice in a row. It was *really* good, probably the best thing I read this year.
* [**The Raven Tower** by Ann Leckie](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/08/21/the-raven-tower-by-ann-leckie/)
   * When I first read this book I initially came away with a slightly negative impression. Upon reflection, I think that this is probably one of the best books I've ever read. Kudos to the author for writing such a gloriously difficult book.
   * It has several flaws, but ultimately I think the author pulls off a stellar story.
   * It contains some of the best understated worldbuilding I've seen in a while.
* [**Minimum Wage Magic** by Rachel Aaron](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/10/minimum-wage-magic-by-rachel-aaron/)
   * Fun! This is a well told story, with a strong plot and pacing and good (and at moments great) characters. Dragons in Detroit! This isn't the Mona Lisa of literature, but a fun good time.
   * The perfect beach read/ airport read. This is a perfect popcorn book, something I can read a dozen times and be happy while reading.

Highly Recommended

* [**Binti** by Nnedi Okorafor](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/04/binti-by-nnedi-okorafor/)
   * Girl goes to space-school, only to be dragged into interstellar war.
* [**Moon over Soho** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/01/moon-over-soho-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Jazz vampires. Jazz. Vampires. They hunt down and suck the lifeforce out of Jazz musicians. And guess what? The protagonist's dad is a jazz musician.
   * Super premise, great stakes.
* [**Broken Homes** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/27/broken-homes-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * It's not every day when you read a book where the bad guy cuts off someone's face and staples it to a tree.
   * Also, the twist at the end with Lesley really set the entire series in a spectacular new direction.
* [**Three Parts Dead** by Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/08/three-parts-dead-by-max-gladstone/)
   * Urban fantasy. This story is a commentary on corporate bankruptcies and bailouts, but with necromancers performing the corporate resurrections!
   * Can Tara save the dead god Kos Everburning from bankruptcy, or will her evil old professor successfully perform a hostile takeover of Kos Everburning's divine assets?
* [**Foxglove Summer** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/15/foxglove-summer-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * My favorite in the series.
   * What happens when a little girl disappears into the forest? You send in the police and sweep the local woods. What happens when a little girl is kidnapped by the faeries in the local woods and replaced by a changeling? You send in Peter for a hostage negotiation.
* [**Last First Snow** by Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/18/last-first-snow-by-max-gladstone/)
   * Urban fantasy 'Occupy Wall Street' style protests! Now with more quetzlcoatl flying bird-snakes and human sacrifice!
   * Can Temoc and the King in Red find common cause after a long and bitter war between them in order to save a ghetto? Or will their longstanding animosity come to ahead again and result in a bloodbath? And what will happen to Temoc's infant son Caleb?
   * My favorite book in the series.
* [**The Hanging Tree** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/20/the-hanging-tree-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Book 6 in the Rivers of London series, this is Part 1 of a 2-part duology, ending with Lies Sleeping. Doesn't really stand on it's own, but I liked it.
* [**Whispers Under Ground** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/25/whispers-under-ground-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Good, at moments great, but also a bit formulatic. When I read this I was growing a bit disenchanted a little with the Rivers of London Urban Fantasy style. It would probably be better if I read it in chronological order.
* [**Saga vol. 1** by Brian Vaughan](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/08/saga-vol-1-by-brian-k-vaughan/)
   * Surprisingly good. Would recommend it to anyone.
* [**Twelve Kings in Sharhakhai** by Bradley P. Beaulieu](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/11/twelve-kings-in-sharakhai-by-bradley-p-beaulieu/)
   * A great start to one of my favorite ongoing series.
* [**The Yahenni short story trilogy** by Alison Luhrs](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/15/born-of-aether-in-the-dead-of-night-and-renewal-by-alison-luhrs/)
   * Magic: the Gathering short stories. I liked these ones, because they're about a character with *style.* And also *bittersweet.* 
* [**Seven Blades in Black** by Sam Sykes](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/30/communist-mechas-vs-deranged-dapper-opera-wizards-vs-gunslinger-sal-cacophony-seven-blades-in-black-by-sam-sykes/)
   * Speaking of style, this book has buckets of style. I need to re-read it.
* [**Undeath and Taxes** by Drew Hayes](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/20/undeath-and-taxes-by-drew-hayes/)
   * Vampire accountancy! Haunted Houses Bed and Breakfasts! Fun!
* [**All Systems Red: Murderbot** by Martha Wells](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/22/great-novella-the-murderbot-diaries-all-systems-red-by-martha-wells/)
   * It's good, but the non-murderbot characters were boring.
* [**Midnight Riot** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/15/midnight-riot-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Liked it a lot, but it's a re-read so I knew I'd like it.
* [**Saga Vol. 2** by Brian Vaughan](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/05/saga-vol-2-by-brian-k-vaughan/)
   * Made me have feels. Really well done.
* [**Orconomics** by J. Zachary Pike](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/24/orconomics-by-j-zachary-pike/)
   * I liked the first half, I liked the second half. I felt the the abrupt tone-switch between the the two halves wasn't quite perfect. If the author handled the transition between the two better this would have been one of my favorites for the year.
* [**Lies Sleeping** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/17/lies-sleeping-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * This, combined with Hanging Tree, was excellent. Bye bye, Faceless Man, you racist jerk. No more stapling people's faces to trees for you. You will not be missed.
* [**Rivers of London: Body Work** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/07/rivers-of-london-body-work-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Comic book! Not my favorite in this series.
* [**Rivers of London: Night Witch** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/03/rivers-of-london-night-witch-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Graphic novel! My favorite in the series.
* [**Rivers of London: Black Mould** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/10/rivers-of-london-black-mould-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Graphics novel! Mold jazz! Revenge magic! Making rent! My second favorite.
* [**Rivers of London: Detective Stories** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/17/rivers-of-london-detective-stories-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Graphic novel. I liked the art styles and the low stakes.
* [**The Way of Kings** by Brandon Sanderson](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/01/the-way-of-kings-by-brandon-sanderson/)
   * Re-read. Still good.
* [**Lirael** by Garth Nix](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/25/lirael-by-garth-nix/)
   * Re-re-re-re-re-read, or rather re-listen to. Tim Curry is a great narrator.
* [**Two Serpents Rise** by Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/06/two-serpents-rise-by-max-gladstone/)
   * Urban Fantasy parable about water rights and corporate mergers! Now with more alien-geometry demons and using dark wizard contracts to slyly defeat your enemies and collapse the international economy!
   * Can Caleb convince his terrorist father Temoc to stop trying to kill the King in Red, or will Temoc kill the King and cause everyone in the city to die of dehydration?
   * Most improved upon re-read. I liked the themes and tropes used in this one. The cliches I disliked on the first read I liked this time, because I saw that they were in the service of honoring noir genre conventions.
* [**Melting Stones** by Tamora Pierce](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/08/melting-stones-by-tamora-pierce/)
   * This is a sad book. Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic setting. Fantasy-Krakatoa is about to go boom and it's up to Rosethorn and Evey to save everyone who lives on the island.
* [**Rivers of London: Water Weed** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/14/water-weed-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Graphic novel! Cool villain. I like that the bad guy wasn't some world-ending threat, just a person who wanted to get rich growing marijuana using magic.
* [**Guilds of Ravnica** by Nicky Drayden](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/01/guilds-of-ravnica-ravnica-allegiance-by-nicky-drayden/)
   * More Magic the Gathering fiction. Only for Magic fans, but if you are a fan this is really good.
* [**The October Man** by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/03/the-october-man-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Rivers of London novella. I liked it. Wine in Germany, while dealing with a little murder on the side!
* [**Dealing with Dragons** by Patricia C Wrede](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/19/dealing-with-dragons-by-patricia-c-wrede/)
   * Re-read. I first read this 20 years ago when I was a kid. I listened to the full-cast audio and it was very fun. Definitely a kid's book.
* [**Mono No Aware** by Ken Liu](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/05/mono-no-aware-by-ken-liu/)
   * Heartbreaking and beautiful.
* [**The Cuckoo’s Calling** by Robert Galbraith/ JK Rowling](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/09/the-cuckoos-calling-by-robert-galbraith-aka-j-k-rowling/)
   * Mystery story. As it turns out, JK Rowling can write.
* [**Holy Sister** by Mark Lawrence](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/15/holy-sister-by-mark-lawrence/)
   * Good end to a good series. I liked Red Sister better, but this was a nonetheless worthy addition to the series. I liked the worldbuilding in particular.
* [**Loran’s Smile** by Jeff Grubb](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/12/lorans-smile-by-jeff-grubb/)
   * A nice Magic the Gathering short story. For fans of the game only.
* [**Sandman vol 1** by Neil Gaiman](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/08/14/four-small-reviews/)
   * Some good, some average. I liked what I read and plan to read more... eventually.
* [**Born of Aether** by Alison Luhrs](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/08/14/four-small-reviews/)
   * Re-read. Was good.
* [**Four Roads Cross** by Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/07/31/four-roads-cross-by-max-gladstone-highly-recommended-high-fantasy-courtroom-drama/)
   * International Law urban fantasy! But with eldritch gods and the economics of zombie farm laborers!
   * Can Caleb and Tara team up to prove Kos Everburning and Cyril Undying are not dangerous entities to invest your money in, or will an international cabal of villainous lawyer-warlocks perform hostile takeovers of both gods and turn them into religious sock puppets?
* [**On the Shoulders of Titans** by Andrew Rowe](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/09/11/on-the-shoulders-of-titans-by-andrew-rowe/)
   * Liked it. Looking forward to book 3.
* [**Full Fathom Five** by Max Gladstone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/09/18/full-fathom-five-by-max-gladstone/)
   * International banking urban fantasy! But with mai-tais and police-golems! Don't catch the attention of Smiling Jack, or else you'll disappear!
   * Re-read. I liked it less this time around, because I remembered the mystery twist at the end.
   * I think this book has the best worldbuilding in the entire genre. I read tons of fantasy, so I'm not speaking from a point of ignorance. This book's worldbuilding is really, really good.
* [**Chivalry** by Neil Gaimen](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/10/23/chivalry-by-neil-gaimen/)
   * Go read it without looking for details. Gaiman being whimsical is excellent.
* [‘**Trail of Lightning’** by Rebecca Roanhorse](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/11/27/trail-of-lightning-by-rebecca-roanhorse/)
   * Standard urban fantasy-meets-paranormal romance, but done REALLY well with a sweet 'twist' at the end. I'll probably read book 2 next year.
* [**The Black Prism** by Brent Weeks](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/12/04/the-black-prism-by-brent-weeks/)
   * Standard epic/high fantasy in the vein of WoT, Stormlight, Belgariad, but done really well. I'm reading the rest of the series soon.
* [**Priory of the Orange Tree**](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/29/the-priory-of-the-orange-tree-by-samantha-shannon/)[ by Samantha Shannon](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/29/the-priory-of-the-orange-tree-by-samantha-shannon/)
   * This book's lovely prose and characters nearly made this one of my favorites of the year, but it didn't *quite* blow my socks off. It was bogged down by spotty pacing at points.
* [**The Rage of Dragons** by Evan Winter](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/10/16/a-literary-discussion-of-the-rage-of-dragons-by-evan-winter/)
   * Above average book. Mostly good, at points excellent, never bad. I enjoyed it heartily.
* [**Angel Mage by Garth Nix**](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/12/25/angel-mage-by-garth-nix/)
   * Three Musketeers meets high fantasy. Four servants of the queen must stop a rogue cult from unleashing a foul plague in an attempt to resurrect a dead archangel. 'Twas fun, with glorious prose.

Recommended

* [**Storm Front** by Jim Butcher](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/14/storm-front-by-jim-butcher/)
   * Re-read. Holds up better on the re-read. Run of the mill noir, but with fantasy elements.
* [**Empire of Sand** by Tasha Suri](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/13/empire-of-sand-by-tasha-suri/)
   * I didn't like it personally (romance ain't my thing), but this was well written. I gave it additional points because it is so well written.
* [**Zero G** by Dan Wells](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/22/zero-g-by-dan-wells/)
   * Fun audiobook for children.

* [**American Craftsmen** by Tom Doyle](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/01/american-craftsmen-by-tom-doyle/)
   * I liked it on a personal level, but it was held back a little by the characters being a smidgen dull. If the characters were more vibrant this book would have easily been a Highly Recommended.
   * Cool, Americana based worldbuilding. Never seen anything like it, except sort of reminding me of Tim Powers. (The prose isn't on Power's level, though.)
* [**Kingdom of Copper** by S. A. Chakraborty](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/02/06/kingdom-of-copper-by-s-a-chakraborty/)
   * One of my personal favorites of the year. I am personally fond of the characters and setting, which is why I liked it so much.
   * Not as good as the first overall, because I thought it needed higher stakes and the plot didn't quite click for me. I would still suggest that you check it out.
* [T**he Wicked + The Divine: The Faust Act** by Kieron Gillen](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/29/the-wicked-the-divine-the-faust-act-by-kieron-gillen/)
   * I liked the themes, I liked some of the characters... but there wasn't quite enough substance for my taste. Worth reading nonetheless.
* [**Batman: Year One**](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/12/batman-year-one-by-frank-miller/)

* [**The Black Tides of Heaven** by J Y Yang](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/08/the-black-tides-of-heaven-by-j-y-yang/)

* [**Gods of Jade and Shadow** by Silvia Moreno-Garcia](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/04/gods-of-jade-and-shadow-by-silvia-moreno-garcia/)
   * Well written, but I didn't really enjoy it. Kinda occupied the same space as Empire of Sand for me, where I acknowledge that it is well written and I'm not the target audience.
* [**The Fliers of Gy** by Ursula K. LeGuin](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/04/24/the-fliers-of-gy-by-ursula-k-le-guin/)

* [**Alanna: The First Adventure** by Tamora Pierce](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/03/alanna-the-first-adventure-by-tamora-pierce/)
   * Re-read after 15 years or so. Good book, charismatic main character, suffered from a lack of a cohesive plot arc from page 1 to page fin.
* [**Theft of Swords** by Michael J. Sullivan](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/05/13/theft-of-swords-by-michael-j-sullivan/)

* [**Destruction of Justice by** Lawrence Davis](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/06/17/destruction-of-justice-by-lawrence-davis/)

* [**The Shadow of What Was Lost** by James Islington](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/07/01/the-shadow-of-what-was-lost-by-james-islington/)
   * Epic fantasy. I had a good time, I can recommend it broadly, just don't expect a masterpiece. I'll read the next book sometime next year.
* [**Beneath the Twisted Trees** by Bradley P Beaulieu](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/08/28/beneath-the-twisted-trees-by-bradley-p-beaulieu/)
   * Excellent book 4 in the series. Upped the stakes from book 3. I liked it.
   * I gave it a 'Recommended' rating and not 'Highly Recommended' because the series is asking a lot of questions and giving few answers.

* [**Abhorsen** by Garth Nix](http://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/12/18/abhorsen-by-garth-nix/)
   * Fantastic conclusion to the initial Old Kingdom trilogy. Fastest pacing in the series. It would be Highly Recommended if it had a little more character development.

Recommended with Reservations

* [**The Midnight Front** by David Mack](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/16/midnight-front-by-david-mack/)
   * It had the very best chapter of all the books I read this year, a chapter I'll remember for my entire life. It was a 'Schindler's List' moment of compelling storytelling.
   * It had the coolest, most grimdark magic system I've ever read: you summon demons from Hell and sell them your soul in exchange for magic. The more demons you summon, the more insane you go.
   * You don't want to sell your soul, but you have to because the Nazi warlocks are taking over Western Europe and Russia.  If you don't fight fire with fire millions of innocent Jews, LGBT, communists and Roma will die, and the Devil-empowered Nazis will attack Britain and the US next.
   * Unfortunately, the protagonist was as dull as a spoon, and the book was too long. Ultimately these two disadvantages took me out of the book.
   * I'll give it and the sequel another go one of these days.
* [**The Sword of Shannara** by Terry Brooks](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/18/the-sword-of-shannara-by-terry-brooks/)

   * Sarcastic comment: FANDOM CONTROVERSY 1, HERE BE (POORLY WRITTEN) DRAGONS!
   * Sober comment: MtG novel. WotS: Ravnica wasn't as bad as it's reputation suggests. It wasn't *good*, mind you, but it wasn't bad. Mediocre, or maybe a little worse than mediocre. But not awful.
* [**War of the Spark: Forsaken** by Greg Weisman](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/11/14/i-will-not-be-reviewing-war-of-the-spark-2-forsaken/)
   * Sarcastic comment: FANDOM CONTROVERSY 2, THE BRAWNY (AND DECIDEDLY MALE) EDITION
   * Sober comment: I read the first fifteen or so pages, decided this book was bad, and returned it. You should read it only if you're a fan of train wrecks. (My sympathies, Greg. Wizards did you dirty with this one.)
   * On the bright side, the r/magictcg subreddit got about a month of memes out of this, until Oko turned the subreddit into elks.
* [**The Baboon War** by Nnedi Okorafor](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/08/14/four-small-reviews/)

* [‘**Escaping Exodus**’ by Nicky Drayden](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/10/30/escaping-exodus-by-nicky-drayden/)
   * This was one of my top 15 favorite books of the year. At moments it was truly excellent and innovative. However the whole 'space tentacle body horror civilization' thing makes this niche, so I can only recommend it only with reservations.
   * Are you in the mood to try something weird? I can recommend this wholeheartedly.
* [“**The Dresden Files: Dog Men**” by Jim Butcher](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/11/06/the-dresden-files-dog-men-by-jim-butcher/)

* [”**Rivers of London: Cry Fox**‘ by Ben Aaronovitch](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/11/13/rivers-of-london-cry-fox-by-ben-aaronovitch/)
   * Graphic novel! A bit meh, to be honest. It just didn't have thematic cohesiveness.

Video Games

* [**Masquerada Songs and Shadows**](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/02/masquerada-songs-and-shadows-by-witching-hour-studios/)
   * Unexpected indie gem. Really good Venice-like worldbuilding. Has great voice actors. The gameplay is fun. Shame it never took off.
* [**The Talos Principle**](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/01/20/the-talos-principle-by-croteam/) \+ The Road to Gehenna
   * I beat the Talos Principle + the Road to Gehenna main game. I am now in the middle of getting all the bonus stars in order to save ADMIN. Great game, love the puzzles. I'll post a Road to Gehenna review once I beat it (if I beat it, getting the stars is hard).
* [**Dishonored 2 + Dishonored: Death of the Outsider**](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/03/31/dishonored-2-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-by-arkane-studios/)
   * Had the best level design of any game I ever played. Between 'The Clockwork Mansion' and 'The Crack in the Slab,' which comboed with the game's teleportation and stealth based gameplay to be magnificent. Plus the art style, this game was just baller.
* Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
   * Just got this about a month ago and I'm only about 1/3 of the way through (I just beat Folding Screen Monkies and am now working on Corrupted Monk). I've never played such a difficult game before, but I have to say that I like the gameplay loop of try-die-repeat. Self-improvement is half the fun of it. And the swordplay/assassination playstyle is crisp and satisfying even when you die. Together they make dying on the same boss over and over feel fun, because you see their health bar getting lower and lower on each try.
   * In other games you steamroll 'easy' bosses on your first try, and for hard bosses you have to fight them one or two more times. I like that in Sekiro 'easy' bosses kill you only two or three times, whereas hard bosses kill you ten or twenty times (or thirty or forty).
   * That said, screw you Lady Butterfly.",1
794,"A Review: The Land: Monsters (Book 8 of Chaos Seeds by Aleron Kong) -Spoilers-I've decided to do a review of this recently released book, since it has hit the Top 10 on Kindle. 

TLDR at the bottom

To give you a little background, the series focuses on Richter, a man moved from Earth to a world ruled by systems similar to RPGs. The protagonist runs through a series of very lucky events, acquiring buildings and other items normally only found in vastly wealthy and ancient kingdoms. He found a village which gives him more rare abilities, and basically becomes overpowered. Up to this point, the series has focused equally on the protagonist and the development of the village, with a very strong focus on fight scenes.

Now, on to our main focus: Monsters is listed as 800+ pages, I read it in 4 hours. I'm a fast reader, but I'm not that fast. The spacing of the book has obviously been manipulated for Kindle Unlimited, but that's not something I'll concern myself with. 

The book follows our protagonist as he makes bad choice after predictable bad choice. He stumbles into a monster lair without preparing himself, nearly dies, has a favor called in by a demon, goes through received information that would have been previously helpful, goes through a brand new advancement system of ascendance never previously addressed, and then has everything go perfectly for him. 

What occurs next is a stream-of-consciousness enchanting screed which covers a couple dozen pages, a decision to ignore extreme hunger and thirst to create something which could easily explode due to distractions caused by said hunger and thirst, and another series of incredibly lucky moves. 

At this point, we are roughly 70% through  the book. Since the only full fight scene took place at the 60% mark where a slime almost kills the protagonist, the protagonist fights a scorpion which nearly kills him, a nest of baby scorpions which he eats and develops food poisoning from (There's a section about explosive diarrhea here, using the word poopie a stunning 9 times in 8 pages.) The protagonist is then almost killed by an overgrown worm in a fight that takes 33 pages and 2 chapters to finish. Anxiously searching for a way to put himself out of his misery, the maniac then tracks down the lair and launches an assault on a group of over 30 other worms similar to the one that almost killed him, and meets a group of orcs.

To paraphrase an Adam Sandler movie that definitely wasn't in the running for any awards: At no point in this rambling, incoherent book was there anything even close to a rational plotline, story progression, or character progression. Everyone who read it is is now dumber for having done so. May God have mercy on our souls.

In conclusion, the book I overpaid for was in fact a novella that had gone through a Willy Wonka-esque taffy puller and was turned into a drawn-out book that should have been euthanized. I dearly hope the author chooses to rewrite this book, rather than leave it as a novel which makes the middle books of the Wheel of Time series seem like a fast-paced thriller.

TLDR: Don't buy this book. It has no character or story progression, juggles approximately 7 Idiot Balls at once, and drags on well past the point it should have experienced a mercy killing.",1

# BEST DEBUT NOVELS

\------------------------------------------------

## The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow

""*She writes a door of blood and silver. The door opens just for her.""*

Of all the books I read this year, The Ten Thousand Doors of January is the one that I think will stick with me the most. This book *worked* for me, completely and utterly. This novel touched my heart, and I loved it unabashedly. Alix E. Harrow filled me with a wistful nostalgia for a past I never had, for people I never met, and hope for a future filled with stories I'll never read.

January Scaller is a young girl growing up in the early 1900s. She’s leashed and tamed by a man who thinks of her as just another curio in his collection – but when her father goes missing, she’s forced to confront both her abilities and her past. This is a coming of age novel, a novel about exploring both this world and others, and a novel about lost souls seeking one another out through the ten thousand Doors between worlds.

## The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Starling

*""She stared down at the wreckage. The suit had been half crushed. The mask was off, revealing pits where eyes had been, and tight, dried skin stretched over a prominent, masculine chin. The caver’s chest had been split open, and a filamentous white fungus grew from the hole. . . Bile rose in the back of her throat, and she turned away.""*

The Luminous Dead was delightfully ambitious, particularly for a debut. Although I tend to prefer smaller casts in my books, Starling took this to an extreme by having only two characters throughout the entirety of her novel. By ""two characters,"" mind, I don't mean two point of view characters. I literally mean that this is a book with only two people in it - and it *works*. It works so well that I lost quite a bit of sleep over it. Starling took several ideas and threw them together into a novel that I can best describe as an incredibly effective character study in psychological sci-fi cave horror.

Starling evokes a primal, claustrophobic dread in the reader as she describes Gyre Price's descent into the earth. We are with her not only as she listens to the rumbling of the unpredictable Tunnelers (vicious cave-wyrms with a taste for cave-divers), but also as she navigates the currents in the underwater portions of the passage. The silt rises to cover her face shield, and one wrong move will mean she will be swept away into a crevice she cannot hope to free herself from. Truly, the Tunnelers are a secondary danger when compared to the dangers of traversing the cave itself.

I was deeply impressed by every aspect of this book, from the in-depth characterization to the hair-raising brushes with death.

# MOST PROMISING NEW SERIES

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Bone Ships by RJ Barker

*""An arakeesian. No one in living memory had seen a living keyshan, and that he may be be one of the few that did filled him with awe. Oh, he had no doubts about the danger of their mission, none at all. But if a man was to die then what a thing to die for. A sea dragon.""*

The Bone Ships marked my first introduction to RJ Barker's writing. I'd been meaning to read (famous last words) his assassins series for ages, but hadn't quite gotten around to it. Well, The Bone Ships made me *seriously* regret that. It's excellent in every way, and I truly can't wait for the next installment in the trilogy. This is an incredibly strong start, and I have no doubt that it will only get better from here.

Barker's worldbuilding, prose, and characterization are bar none. The use of language to reflect the cultural mores and attitudes quickly pulled me in; noticing new aspects of description, syntax, and structure on each page created a sense of adventure and discovery entirely independent of the plot. The novel has a slow, slice-of-life style start, which greatly appealed to me. I loved seeing the minutiae of the day-to-day in nautical life. After the crew is gathered together, however, the primary plot glides in seamlessly to begins moving forward at a faster clip for those who prefer a more plot-driven narrative.

So much of the world is hinted at rather than stated outright, as the characters are either ignorant themselves or simply take certain aspects of their life for granted. The strange, bird-like Gullaimes, who can call on the winds with their magic and possess a strange kinship with the arakeesians. The beakwyrms, dancing a mad, bloody dance beneath the waves. The Sea Hag and the rest of the gods. All of it is painted with broad strokes, with just enough information given to make you hungry for *more*.

# BEST SOCIAL COMMENTARY

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Queen of the Conquered by Kacen Callender

*""All the masters of the plantation had been killed. Herre Lund ended the uprising swiftly. Every slave on the plantation, whether they claimed innocence or not—whether they were children or not—was executed, their bodies staked and hung from trees so that the other slaves of this island could see.""*

Although Callender has published YA and Middle Grade novels in the past, Queen of the Conquered was their first foray into adult fantasy. They absolutely knocked it out of the park. This is an in-depth look at how racism, classism, and sexism intersect and confer privilege. Even among those of the same race, classism can divide those who should be united in the face of prejudice. In their Publishers Weekly article earlier this year, Callender illuminates these same challenges within the publishing industry: [We Need Diverse Editors](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/81635-we-need-diverse-editors.html). I'm thrilled that their voice was heard in Queen of the Conquered, but also angry at the needless challenges they faced in getting to where they are today. This book and others like it, from the black voices, the queer voices, are *important.*

Callender discusses the realities of slavery and racism with frank brutality and does not shy away from the horrors inherent in racist institutions. Although Sigourney Rose has a kraft that allows her to see, feel, and experience the thoughts and emotions of those around her, she is unable to truly connect to those she claims she fights for. Even as the slaves she says she wishes to free are killed in front of her very eyes, and sometimes by her own hand, she struggles with the internal desire to gain the acceptance and approval of the ruling Fjern class.

## The Pursuit of William Abbey by Claire North

*""I know the truth of men’s hearts, and what I know is that they are right, every single one of them. They live within the power of their own rightness, and anyone who disagrees with them can only be wrong, and being wrong, they are therefore less. That is what I know, and it terrifies me.""*

Colonialism and culture were definitely a theme this year. In This Pursuit of William Abbey, Claire North has constructed a plot that is a fascinating mix of intrigue, social issues, and politics – all set on top of a deadly game of tag.

The titular William Abbey has been cursed with the shadow of young boy who was burned to death by a mob as Abbey looked on. The shadow follows him at a shuffle… slow, but implacable. When the shadow reaches him, it uses him as a conduit to jump to the person he loves most and kill them. And then… it begins its journey again. Abbey must constantly be on the move in order to stay ahead of the shadow and protect the few friends he has remaining.

Abbey is forced to face that he, too, is part of the machine that killed that boy at the Cape. He, too, is perpetuating this with every action he performs for the crown. As he goes on to meet other truth-speakers and sees the truth of their stories and backgrounds, he’s forced to reevaluate his choices. As he sees himself through their eyes, he also sees the horrors that the British Crown has forced on those it subjugates.

# FAVORITE NOVELLAS

\-----------------------------------------------

## This Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone

*""Even poetry, which breaks language into meaning – poetry ossifies, in time, the way trees do. What’s supple, whipping, soft, and fresh grows hard, grows armor. If I could touch you, put my finger to your temple and sink you into me the way Garden does – perhaps then. But I would never.*

*So this letter instead.""*

This book is poetic, romantic, strange, and violent – a whirlwind of emotion, fear, and firsts. Two soldiers fighting on opposite sides of a war up and down through the strands of time find that their greatest joy lies in each other, and thus begin a correspondence. They are two parallel lines that never meet despite having shaped one another through each of their interactions.

Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone have crafted a small masterpiece in this epistolary novella. The prose is some of the most beautiful I've ever read; it moves past purple and into ultravoilet. It's still astonishing to me that it was, in fact, a novella. It *felt* like a full novel, and the seams where you would typically find content cut out to keep down word count simply do not exist. It is one complete narrative, not a piece of a larger whole.

Whatever I can say about this novella will not do it justice. This book is utterly, wholly, an experience in and of itself. It’s the act of reading. It’s the empathy you feel at the characters’ want for one another. This novella is for those who love and wish to feel.

[My Review](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/06/20/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war-by-amal-el-mohtar-max-gladstone-5-5-stars-arc-review/) \- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36516585-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war)

## To Be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers

*""I would never again be the Ariadne who had not been to Opera, just as I would never again be the Ariadne who had never left Earth, just as I would never again be the Ariadne who had never left her parents’ home, who had never bled, who had yet to learn to walk. A moth was a caterpillar, once, but it no longer is a caterpillar. It cannot break itself back down, cannot metamorphose in reverse. To try to eat leaves again would mean starvation. Crawling back into the husk would provide no shelter.""*

To Be Taught is a bittersweet story following four scientists on an exploratory space mission aboard a ship called the Merian. Their goal is to visit several Earth-like planets, where they will record the existence (or lack of existence) of life. They’ve traveled in a state of torpor, allowing their bodies to be preserved while they travel for years upon years while only aging for a small fraction of that time. Of course, this does add up, and the equivalent of aging for two years while asleep for decades takes its toll.

Although the crew hasn’t aged much, this is not true for their friends and family back home on Earth. The team carries this pain with them. When they left Earth, they said good bye forever to their loved ones even though this mission was not meant to be a one way trip. On their return to Earth… they will be alone.

My heart broke for the team of the Merian, even as it was flooded with optimism and hope for humanity. Becky Chambers is a master of delivering sadness and devastation right alongside a true and genuine love for humanity, and that is something that illuminates everything she’s written.

# BEST HORROR

\---------------------------------

# A Lush and Seething Hell by John Hornor Jacobs

*""A thousand voices caromed in my head. From such a remove, I can see now it was just the tugging of the flesh, trying to find something to grasp onto to protect itself, the quivers of an organism in distress sorting through experience and conditioning.*

*My life up until then was just a fabric of verse and poems.*

*Now my life was no longer mine.""*

This is not a comfortable book. It is brutal. It is often gory. It is violent, torturous, and painful. It is not *palatable.* And yet, A Lush and Seething Hell is perhaps one of the most polished and seamless books I have read. As Chuck Wendig put it in the foreword, “his magic tricks remain pure fucking magic. These murder ballads are ones we have not heard before.” I cannot find it in myself to disagree with him. When I review a book, I tend to pick it apart to see what makes it tick. Then, I reduce it down into a format that will give a reader a good idea as to the tone and content of the book while also allowing some of my own biases and voice to come through. I fail to pick this book apart. I fail to see the specific gears that make it tick, though I can certainly see the hands turning and hear the bells chiming.

While reading The Sea Dreams it is the Sky, the first of the two novellas contained in this book, I found myself searching online repeatedly for the country of “Magera,” located somewhere in South America. This country is fictional, and I suspected as much while reading and due to the futility of my online searches… and yet, I doubted myself. This felt real. This felt like a country that *ought* to exist. And, perhaps, in a way it did exist - only to slip down a voracious, toothy gullet that had been coaxed open with a surfeit of human suffering and cruelty.

My Heart Struck Sorrow takes a sharp turn from the subject matter of The Sea Dreams it is the Sky. Where the former was set in Spain and Latin America, My Heart Struck Sorrow is a tale woven from the fabric of North America, the United States. This is a story of Southern Devils, of the hell that exists in the hearts of men and women. A story of racism, sexism, discriminations large and small, present and past; a story of the sheer *disregard* we hold for our fellows.

# FAVORITE ROMANCE

\-----------------------------------------------

## Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston

*“You gonna ask him to dance, then?” . . .*  
*“In his dreams.”*   
*“Aw,” Nora says, “you’re blushing.”*  
*“Listen,” Alex tells her, “royal weddings are trash, the princes who have royal weddings are trash, the imperialism that allows princes to exist at all is trash. It’s trash turtles all the way down.”*

Generally speaking, 95% of my reading is fantasy and science fiction. Lately, that other 5% has been romance. Almost entirely gay romance. I blame Sharade over at The Fantasy Inn for this. She keeps shilling me gay romance, and, well, here we are. I hope you're happy now. Okay, fine: seeing Alix E. Harrow shilling this book may have been a factor too. But between those two? I was doomed.

Mind, I'm not complaining about this... far from it. They've made me into a complete and utter sucker for gay romance. Between Red, White, and Royal Blue, Witchmark, [The Last Sun](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/11/21/the-last-sun-by-k-d-edwards/), and [Hither, Page](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/06/18/hither-page-by-cat-sebastian-5-5-stars-arc-review/), I've had a damn good year for books that are either romances or contain romance as a major element.

Red, White, and Royal Blue, however takes the cake. I loved it. *I loved it so much, you guys.* I loved it to bits. Truly, I just wanted to take Alex and Henry, smoosh their faces together, and tell them that they need to kiss right this minute and acknowledge that they truly are queer as a maypole and desperately, desperately in love with one another.

The chemistry and banter adds so much to the book. On the surface, the idea of the USA's First Son falling in love with the Prince of Wales seems cheesy and kind of dumb at best. However, the execution is just *perfect*. The entire cast of characters is fantastic; every paragraph is witty, clever, and extremely polished. The dialogue had me laughing aloud. June, Nora, and Henry’s best friend, Pez, add so much with all of their commentary and input. Each one is a fully realized character with their own wants and focuses, which are continuously implied and expanded on as the book proceeds. Each are pulled in multiple directions as they attempt to hold on to their own personhood and identity in the midst of the political milieu.

# BEST NEW INSTALLMENT IN A SERIES

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Red-Stained Wings by Elizabeth Bear

*“There was no Cauled Sun in the sky, no Heavenly River spooling its brightness across the firmament. There was blackness, and the blackness was picked out in little stars that shone with a cold silver light that cast no shadows but made everything seem as flat and foreign as cut paper shapes layered on a canvas.*

*Nizvashiti let its head fall back on its emaciated neck, staring blindly upward. ‘This is a dead sky.'”*

The Red-Stained Wings is the second book in Elizabeth Bear’s The Lotus Kingdoms Trilogy. A review of the first book, The Stone in the Skull, is available [here](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/04/24/the-stone-in-the-skull-by-elizabeth-bear-4-5-5-stars/).

Elizabeth Bear is a master of prose and world-building. She explores her landscapes through her characters, often positioning them in direct contact with their respective antagonists. Through this lens, she considers personhood, gender, agency, and many other themes. In her Lotus Kingdoms trilogy, she places this all in a high-fantasy Indian-inspired setting.

While this series is fairly low on action, it makes up for it with a compelling and eclectic cast of characters. Mrithuri and Sayeh, cousins and prophetess-queens of rival kingdoms. The Dead Man, an elite bodyguard sworn to a dead king. The Gage, a brass automaton driven by old hurts and a desire for revenge.

This was a fantastic second installment, improving on the first in every way. It was a pleasure to see characters who I had followed in the first book finally meet up and interact, and scope expanded significantly to encompass cosmic concerns as well as the mundane.

# BEST HISTORICAL FANTASY

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Where Oblivion Lives by T. Frohock

*""Louder now, as if sensing his presence, the music drew near. The bow attacked the strings (Diago recalled making those quick jabs: strike, strike, strike, followed by a smooth pull) before slurring the chords into decay. The intro descended into pallid notes, gray and soft like fog (no, the smell of cordite is strong in the air... it is not fog but smoke) drifting over the muddy ground.""*

Where Oblivion Lives is the first full novel in the Los Nefilim series by T. Frohock. Although she wrote three novellas that take place prior to Where Oblivion Lives collected in one volume titled [Los Nefilim](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/10/30/book-review-los-nefilim-by-t-frohock-5-5-stars-needs-graphics/) (hence Goodreads labeling it as #4), this novel was written to serve as an introduction for newcomers to the books. It's not necessary to read [Los Nefilim](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/10/30/book-review-los-nefilim-by-t-frohock-5-5-stars-needs-graphics/) first, though I do highly encourage reading them at some point solely because they're excellent. My review of Los Nefilim can be found [here](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/10/30/book-review-los-nefilim-by-t-frohock-5-5-stars-needs-graphics/).

Though it's inspired by Christian lore, this is certainly not a religious book any moreso than a book based on Greek or Roman mythology. The Nefilim of Spain are embroiled in a war to save humanity, and there is no one they can trust. The angels are corrupt, the demons are not to be trusted, and even members of Los Nefilim have been compromised. Diago, a half demon and half angel nefil, must not only work to earn his place among Los Nefilim along with his husband, Miquel, but also protect their son from forces that would do him harm.

Frohock's prose is lyrical and rhythmic, drawing on the structure and syntax of the Spanish language and pulling them through into English to create a secondary layer to her writing. Her descriptions of music capture the reader, enchanting them just as Diago is enthralled by the chords of his stolen violin which haunt his dreams. Frohock became deaf around the age of 12, but the music she misses and loves is woven masterfully throughout her work.

# MOST CREATIVE FANTASY

\------------------------------------------------------------

## The Imaginary Corpse by Tyler Hayes

The Imaginary Corpse by Tyler Hayes is hands-down the most imaginative, fresh, and kind book I’ve read this year. It is absolutely unlike anything else I’ve read, combining the innocence and creativity of a middle grade novel with the darkness and trauma of adult fantasy. At a glance, that makes it tempting to label this book as YA or middle grade, but upon reading it, that’s clearly not the case. It deals with loss of innocence, growing up, trauma, PTSD, identity, and abuse in a way that is both genuinely kind and genuinely heartbreaking.

Detective Tippy, a stuffed triceratops and owner of the Stuffed Animal Detective Agency, is our main character. He’s the former imaginary friend of a young girl, Sandra, and most of his personality came from her. However, much like all of the other Friends in the Stillreal, Tippy’s person underwent a trauma that forced her to give up Tippy. She did not merely grow up. She did not just stop believing. Instead, she saw her father die in front of her, and Tippy became too painful for her to keep him around any more. When Tippy is punted away from Sandra and into the Stillreal, he finds a new home and a new family.

his book doesn’t end with everyone happy and safe, but it does end with everyone doing their best to care for one another despite that.

# MOST FUN

\-------------------------

## The Hanged Man by KD Edwards

*""My name is Rune Saint John. I am, before anything else, a survivor: of a fallen house, of a brutal assault, of violent allies and complacent enemies, of life among a people who turned their back on me decades ago.""*

You know what’s a great feeling? When you love a book, start up the sequel, and discover that the sequel takes everything you loved in the first book and makes it even better. If you’re not already familiar with the Tarot Sequence, my review of the first book in this series can be found here: [The Last Sun](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/11/21/the-last-sun-by-k-d-edwards/). KD Edwards has nailed his voice in The Hanged Man, and has given us even more and even better character interactions. Brand and Rune are still the ultimate bromance, and Addam is still the kind and caring partner Rune needs and deserves. Max, Quinn, Ciaran… everything you wanted and more. Absolute cinnamon rolls, all of them – and the new characters are similarly great. I flat out had *fun* with these books.

Although the writing style is loose and modern on the surface, a closer examination will reveal a tight, highly polished narrative. If there’s a Chekhov’s gun present, rest assured that it will be fired at some point. Every strand of narrative and plot is relevant, word choice is deliberate, and that which isn’t explained fully will be in the future. There are hints peppered liberally throughout regarding Rune’s dark past and quite a few fan theories floating around to explain them. KD Edwards plays to his audience in the best possible ways, crafting a fun, engaging narrative that will tug on your heartstrings.

Thank you!",1
801,"Has anyone read the Benjamin Ashwood series? [SPOILERS]I admit, this is a kind of post I rarely make.  I'm generally in the camp of ""If I don't like it, I'm going to drop it"".  And yet we have this series.  Basically, I want to like it:  all the reviews say it's in the same camp as Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, LotR, etc... all of which I LOVE.  And yet... those are Epic Fantasies.  I've only read the first book, but it's feeling like a Sword and Sorcery series (there's a HUGE difference between those two genres).

It started out great, and then... &gt;!well, to be precise, there never was a mention of Hero Saving the World or even Threat to Mankind and the World is Back, though it hints at the second one.  Anyways, after a great opening where they have to deal with demons and need to get to the City ASAP... it slows way. the. hell. down.  Because he's not supposed to be a Chosen Hero in any shape, he goes into business as a brewer once he hits the city.  I nearly quit the book after a couple of chapters of this, because it went from Awesome Fantasy to more like an anime called Spice and Wolf- the latter isn't bad, it just doesn't belong in something that had the promise of being an Epic Fantasy.  The end of the book picks up a little, but I'm afraid it'll be more of Ben and Amelie just running away as the world starts to slowly fall to pieces!&lt;

Anyone able to give some insight if this goes into Epic Fantasy, or if it just stays at ""exploring the world Swords-And Sorcery"" kind of deal?",1

But im finding it hard to find any books like [this.It](https://this.It) would also be a huge plus if the book only had one pov (Easier to connect to the story.) It would also be great if the mc was perhaps a little evil or turns evil as the series goes on. Some books I have found like this are

Broken Empire series

I recently started reading the wandering inn, which is like the most famous litRPG (at least that I know of) but I'm not really enjoying it that much.

807,"What's some dark/gothic fantasy that is *not* grimdark?I read Bram Stoker's Dracula a couple of years ago and absolutely loved the brooding, heavy atmosphere, the dread,  otherworldly terror of the night,  etc.   

But I also loved that, despite all of these things, despite losing Lucy in one of the most horrific ways poissible, Mina Harker and Abraham Van Helsing never give in to cynicism or hatred.   Despite the awefulness of the ordeal he's suffered,  Jonathan Harker remains fundamentally himself. 

Basically, I love the atmosphere of dark/gothic  fantasy and it's aesthetic and set pieces and drama and horror,  but I detest the empty,  vile cynicism and nihilism of a lot of popular recent dark fantasy.   

What's some new dark fantasy that avoids these modern failings, that feels more like Stoker or Byron or Dunsany in world-view?  

IE: Dark fantasy that rejects or ignores the ""everything sucks forever and will never get better"" attitude?",1
808,"Looking for single pov hero/coming of age fantasy books like KKC or BloodsongI get tired of books with too many POV characters, I usually come to enjoy one of one specific one and all the rest become boring. I just want another hero to fall in love with and watch grow over a series like Kvothe or Vaelin, I also love the aspect of coming of age (character growing over the series).

Some of the books I have read that I believe fit under this catagory are ;

Farseer Trilogy - The book focuses on an orphan bastard who has telepathic powers growing up as on the fringe of royalty. He also gets trained to be the kings assassin, lots of growing pains in various areas of his life.

Cradle Series - Tells the story of a young boy at the lowest rung of society slowly climb his way up by gaining more and more power. (Probly a bad synopsis but yeah)

Mageborn or Embers of Illeniel - Both are great coming of age series (Embers of Illenial gets dark... like super dark)

Left Hand Of God - Great story about a young man leaving his 'Cult' and gaining a new understanding of life (lots of plot twists)

Others are:

 \-The saxon stories

\-Quilifer

\-Stupid Fast by Geoff Herbach

\-Empire of silence

\-Viridian gate (illusionist)

\-Wheel of time (first book only)

\-Riftwar saga (first book liked the ideo of having to be a slave)

809,"Books with a similar grim feeling to dark souls?I just started reading the Lies of Locke Lamora tonight and instantly got some dark souls vibes( although it's most definitely pre souls anything). So Im curious to know if anyone can give any recommendations as to fantasy with either a dark souls or bloodborne influence. I love the grimey nature of dark souls, everything just feels so bleak and hopeless but in such a dense detailed way. Not just your average crumbled village, but one that's been totally corrupted by the destruction leaving it with an evil presence and character. Not to mention just the environmental descriptions but the characters always give off that feeling, just a sense that they're not to be trusted. I don't know if any of that makes sense but that's the best description of what I'm looking for. So thank you in advanced and I'm looking forward to any and all recommendations",1
810,"What fantasy series have big magic, and impressive action scenes?I seem to enjoy my fantasy the most when it has ""big"" magic, cool action, and bad ass characters. Perhaps its abit shallow, but I read some pretty amazing series that have those things as well as plenty of depth. Looking for additional recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I read so far (and highly recommend to anyone with similar taste) (Minor spoilers ahead):

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Anything by Brandon Sanderson** \- Because even if it might not always be around its around often enough and when it is its great. Some nights Radiant can fight an army to a standstill, while awakeners can make whole armies out of materials and corpses. Highest power levels get pretty silly.

**Cradle/Travelers gate/Arcane ascension/Mage Errant** series - Turns out I love ""main character powers up"" books. They still have to be written well but this is one of those series. This is bazically ""zero to hero: the instruction manual"". Magic is eeeeeeverywhere. Literally, people without magic are the rare exception (or get very little focus) and even 10 hear olds can break boulders with bare hands.

**Night angel** trilogy - with the focus of the story being on a magical assassin who spends most of his time interacting with magical stuff, there's plenty of magic to go around. And when fights happen, boy is there alot of magic thrown around.

**Lightbringer** \- every single important character has magic. Magic is colorful (literally), does big things, and the stronger magic users can solo a small army.

**Demon wars** cycle - starts off as low magic because no one knows how to use it. Ends with main characters throwing lightning, flying and regenerating mortal wounds.

**Chaos queen** series - While magic is ""rare"", one of the main characters is a drug addict magic savant, the other is a magic assassin with amnesia. Then there's a vampire that turned when she was a 13 year old girl and still looks that way, a priestess that is praying for miracles that come true. The strongest of characters can again solo small armies (and do).

**Licanius Trilogy**\- Starts off pretty ""average"" and proceeds to show you 4000+ year old immortals that shrug off stupid amounts of damage, can practically stop time, make portals, and torch cities.

&amp;#x200B;

So what else can I read that is epic fantasy, has high power levels and big explosions (but executes those things well)?",1
811,"Necromancy used for good?Are there any books out there where one of the heroes uses necromancy, rather than it being ""evil"" magic?  I've been thinking about that off and on and figured I might as well ask.",1
812,"Reddit Fantasy Writer of the Day - Tao Wong - Author of A Thousand Li, the System Apocalypse and more series - AMAHi there r/fantasy!

I’m Tao Wong, your Reddit Fantasy Writer of the Day. I'm best known (which isn't saying much :) ) as the author of [A Thousand Li](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VXJFRFV) (a xianxia fantasy series) and the [System Apocalypse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077LNLSZ7) (A post-apocalyptic LitRPG); though I have 2 other series as well. I've produced ebooks, paperbacks and audiobooks for all of them and the System Apocalypse even has a comic!

As an author, I've been full-time since 2019 and indie publishing since mid-2017. I actually am fascinated by the business side of publishing and was reading Kristyn Kathryn Rusch's business blog long before I even thought of publishing my own work.

Outside of that, I live in Whitehorse, the Yukon Territories, Canada. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were one of the coldest recorded locations on Earth, coming out of -40C and lower weather (that's -40F and lower temperature for Americans). I've been up here for 7 years now, and spend most of the winter hiding from the bitter cold. I used to own a game store (Starlit Citadel) and managed the business from the Yukon remotely, thanks to some great staff.

Personally, I enjoy the outdoors and do a bunch of hiking and camping. I recently started learning how to snowboard. However, my biggest form of exercise used to be martial arts (I stopped for a few years due to some injuries. I'm hoping to finish fixing them this year and get back to practice). I've been practicing martial arts on/off for two decades now, with time spent doing Western Martial Arts, tai chi, karate, wushu, boxing, etc. Yeah - I never got good at any one thing before shifting to a new style.

Other than physical activities, hmmm... long time RPGer (rather obviously); though not much of a computer game since the early 2000's. Partly because I played a TON of board games or RPGs, and partly due to tendinitis. I love cooking and  I'm a huge TV / movie fan too, though I tend to flip between consuming a ton and then not as I catch up on my reading.

And that's all I can think of to start. Feel free to ask me anything. I don't promise sensible answers, but I'm not super sensible anyway. :)

814,"Fae Hunter by Sarah K. L. Wilson: read it in two sittings.&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqsav3j8ffd41.jpg?width=353&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=750ffa9d85eb678b7b513d094573226f9d09818a

It's been awhile since I read a book in two sittings, but I read the first half of Sarah K. L. Wison's Fae Hunter on the flight down from ConFusion, and the second half the following night. It's a rare book these days that grabs my attention and holds it, but Fae Hunter was compulsively readable.

When her sister opens a portal to the land of the fae and unleashes chaos and horror upon their community, Allie decides that she'll set matters to rights, even if she has to go against the fae, their monsters, and even her own community to do so.

The heroine Allie Hunter is ornery and sensitive, stubborn and desperate, caring and passionate in equal measure. It's her voice that makes this book such a pleasure to read, and when she goes blind at the end of the first chapter to all but the spirit world (not a spoiler, this is in the blurb) the whole book takes a delightful turn toward the strange and unexpected.

Something else I appreciated about this book: Sarah Wilson nails the fae. In my mind true fae should be as beautiful and dangerous as a polished blade, as prone to cut as they are to serve, and Sarah nails this dichotomy, bringing to life fairies who are as inhuman as they are alluring.

It's a quick read at only 224 pages long, and despite being quite dark at times is billed as a YA fantasy. If you're up for a fun, fast paced novel with an engaging setting, an easy to root for heroine, plenty of danger lurking in the eves, wonderfully nasty villagers who are even more to hate than the fae, and all of it told in a compulsively readable manner, then take a look at Fae Hunter. You just might devour it in two sittings as well.

815,"Recommendations for books with adventuring party’sI’ve always had a big love of ensemble casts in fiction. I imagine I’m not the only one who thought that when the whole Fellowship was together, that was some of the best material in LOTR. There’s something really comfy and fun about the traditional adventuring party to me. I love seeing all these varied character dynamics from people of all different backgrounds and skillsets learning to empathize and work together towards a common goal. Even outside of fantasy I think ensembles are fascinating, like the crews from Star Trek, or superhero teams like X-Men, Justice League, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.

Now I’ve been getting back into some old reading habits lately and been in a huge fantasy mood in particular thanks to recently starting Fire Emblem Three Houses. I’m especially a big fan of high/epic fantasy, but I like a little bit of everything. A lot of my favorite fantasy works, literary or not, feature a prominent adventuring party at the center, like something you’d see in a D&amp;D party for example. So I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations for books that featured such ensemble casts?

There’s already a number of stories like this I’m familiar with. Like Fellowship of course, and the original Dragonlance books. I’m slowly making my way through Wheel of Time too. I’ve got many other series on my radar at the moment as well, like Stormlight Archive (along with Sandersons other works), and the Malazan series (not sure if it’s an ensemble but looks interesting regardless).

I would especially love to hear recommendations for books/series that have interesting lore and magic systems (original requests, I’m sure) and for anything by female writers or with really prominent female characters. I’d especially love to hear about any all female ensembles, from what I’ve been able to research those are pretty rare in traditional fantasy stories.",1
816,"A little disappointed by The Rage of Dragons after all the hype on this subPicked up Rage of Dragons recently after seeing some overwhelming praise on here about it, and since the author is a Redditor and started indie, I thought I'd go ahead and support him. the book seemed right up my alley too - cool, underutilized setting, something a bit older than your typical medieval times, and one of my favourite tropes: the magic/military academy. 

After finishing the book though, I must say I'm a little underwhelmed. There are some things I liked a lot about it. As I mentioned, the African setting is not very common (although maybe moreso lately) and it's nice to see some diversity on that front. The worldbuilding with the tribes was pretty interesting and well-developed. 

The book was paced quite well, too. For the most part, it moved pretty fast, and I have to say I don't ever think I was bored. There's something always happening.

What I didn't like about it are the aspects I typically value above all else when reading: characters, dialogue and prose. This is where the book lost me a bit. For the most part, the characters felt a little flat and undeveloped. Tau in particular wasn't given much depth or complexity, and felt very much like a shounen anime protagonist where his only defining trait is his iron will and determination to be the bestest ever in his chosen fighting style. I don't remember much about the other characters either as I felt they fell into stock action fantasy stereotypes.

The writing style and dialogue was kind of stilted and clunky as well, with some of the interactions between characters being particularly cheesy. I know prose is a subjective thing, and especially in fantasy as it does seem like a lot of readers are fine with the functional Sandersonesque ""window pane"" prose - so YMMV. For me, there was just a bit of a lack of polish on that end. 

The story itself, although fast-paced, was a little one-note and predictable. It just felt like an endless parade of action scenes and after a while they all blur together. Fast-paced is fine but I wish there was some time for some character development and some introspection. Action and magic just by itself can't carry a story imo.

All in all, I was expecting a bit more after the hype but I will also say that Evan Winter does have quite a bit of talent and the ingredients are there in this book fro a promising future. At the very least, even if I didn't really like this one that much, I was still intrigued enough to probably check out the 2nd book in the series.",1
817,"Learn from Your Favorite Authors by Reading with a Critical Eye[Link to the original blog](https://www.campfiretechnology.com/2020/01/learn-from-your-favorite-authors-by-developing-a-critical-eye/)

If you have sought writing advice in the past, you have no doubt been told to read a lot. Stephen King is so serious about reading that he says if you don’t have time to read, then you don’t have time to write. Reading is *that* important to writing. It’s your window into the author’s world, and see how masters of the craft make magic happen on the page.

When you read for pleasure, the story plays out as a movie in your head. You can’t take it so easily when you read to learn. You must dive into the details- dissect the text and see what makes it breathe. This is reading with a critical eye.

To read with a critical eye, rewind back to high school. If you took a literature class, then you already know how to examine a work. You were expected to make arguments about how the writer accomplishes certain goals. Emulate this mindset as you read.

Let’s go to school.

## Learn the Craft

Constantly seek out more knowledge about writing. There are endless guidelines and tropes to learn about and knowing these things will give you insight. How are you supposed to look for something if you don’t know what you’re looking for?

There are endless online resources for learning about writing, from masterclasses to video essays on YouTube. Read critiques of your favorite books. Watch people break down scenes into their components. Read our “Craft” posts. Learning new concepts will allow you to see them play out when you start practicing and reading.

There are endless online resources for learning about writing, from masterclasses to video essays on YouTube. Here’s a list of some of our favorites:

[Hello Future Me (Tim Hickson)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQMO-YL87u-6Rt8hIVsRjA) – Hickson makes video essays on all aspects of writing and worldbuilding. If you are looking for a place to learn how to build a world that feels consistent and lived in, he’s your guy. He also has a book on the subject that you can pick up [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Worldbuilding-I-Timothy-Hickson-ebook/dp/B07PNKHDFZ)

[Overly Sarcastic Productions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodbH5mUeF-m_BsNueRDjcw) – OSP takes old stories and tropes and puts them in a digestible and funny format. If you want to learn about story telling of old or writing structure, they have your back.

[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH3mK1NZn9QqOSj3ObrP3xL8tEJQ12-vL) – If you don’t already know him, Sanderson is a best-selling fantasy author. He has a series of lectures on YouTube where he discusses everything from worldbuilding to publishing.

[Lessons from the Screenplay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCErSSa3CaP_GJxmFpdjG9Jw/featured) – LFTS takes deep dives into movies and pulls out invaluable knowledge on how they were crafted. If you are interested in learning how to write great screenplays, check this channel out.

[Daniel Greene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg/featured) – Greene reviews and critiques new book, movie, and television releases. Critiques like his help you learn what doesn’t work so you can avoid it in your writing.

There are tons of subjects to learn about. Whether it be dialogue, the Hero’s Journey, worldbuilding, exposition, characterization, etc., start learning the basics. If you already have a grasp on these concepts, that doesn’t mean you get to skip class. There will always be holes in your knowledge to fill.

One of the big breakthrough learning moments I had was learning about the Hero’s Journey. I started with a theoretical understanding. I knew the steps and what purposes they served in a story, but I didn’t know how it *actually* functioned in storytelling. Then I started looking for it in books and movies. I saw how other creators used it, and my understanding slowly transformed into something more concrete.

You can learn about something, but you will gain a deeper understanding by watching others and practicing.

## Practice

Now it’s time to take all that knowledge and put it to use. Take the concepts you’ve learned and put them on the page. You might not completely understand how to use them at first, and that’s okay. Test yourself.. Make deliberate moves to implement these ideas into your writing.

As you use them more, you will start to hit roadblocks. You’ll be trying to pull something off, and it won’t be working. Maybe you can’t work subtext into your dialogue or you can’t figure out how to work in a crucial step of the Hero’s Journey. It might be uncomfortable. That’s good, it means you’re challenging yourself. Work through the issue, and keep moving forward.

Roadblocks will indicate what you need to study further. The more you practice, the more questions you will have. Those questions will guide your eyes as you read. They will focus your attention on how master storytellers solve those problems.

## Reading Critically

At this point, you’ve learned the rules, you’ve implemented them, and now you have questions. Keep those questions with you as you read. Study how authors work with those concepts. This is where you will gain real insight. Anybody can be told how to write dialogue, but not everybody can write great dialogue. Watch how the masters put all of the pieces together.

Take notes as you read. Anytime the text makes you feel an emotion, make a note. Whenever something grabs your attention, make a note. Whenever you get bored, make a note. These notes will make it easier to dig into the text.

To dive deep into a piece, read it at least twice. First, read it normally. Take some notes, but don’t analyze yet. You want to experience the story as a regular reader. Dig deeper on your second pass.. Reading twice will give you the chance to see details you may have overlooked on the first pass, and those details may help answer your questions. The pieces of the puzzle will be more obvious on the second read.

## Reflection

When you’re done reading, reflect and try to answer questions posed during the practice section. Tackle these one at a time. Pick a question and find the reading notes you’ve made on the subject. Look for all the notes that relate to your question. Then ask more questions. Here’s an example:

Initial Question: How do I make a moment have emotional impact?

Now let’s say you are reading Lord of the Rings, and you get to the part where Gandalf fights the Balrog and is killed. You make a note because it makes you sad.

Now ask the question: Why does that moment make me feel sad?

This question may have multiple answers, and those answers may spawn more questions. I advise using an outline to represent it.

 *Why does that moment make me sad?*

1. I liked Gandalf
   1. *Why do I like Gandalf?*
      1. He cares about Frodo
      2. He has a sense of humor and wisdom
      3. He has cool powers
2. I relate to the other characters’ grief
   1. *Why do I relate to their grief?*
      1. I care about those characters
      2. My father passed away suddenly and Gandalf was like a father figure
3. Gandalf was an important member of the team
   1. *Why does this loss make me feel sad?*
      1. The mission is already so bleak, losing the most powerful team member makes it seem hopeless

There are plenty of avenues you can take here. You could get into dialogue and pacing, or you could get as specific as language and syntax. We’ll stick with the questions I outlined for now.

After creating this series of questions and answers, you can start to draw conclusions. Think about how these answers relate to your initial question.

First, moments are emotional when they affect characters that I enjoy. I enjoy characters when they are fun and relatable. **I should make my characters likeable.**

Second, moments are emotional when I can relate to them. **I should write moments that people can relate to.**

Third, moments are emotional when there are stakes. Stakes raise the tension in a scene and draw out emotion. **I should make my emotional moments have stakes.**

Before starting this process, perhaps your “emotional moments” were relatable and had characters you cared about, but they lacked stakes. Now you have the tool to add stakes to a scene to raise the tension and make them more emotional.

This entire process is about adding things to your toolbelt. The more you do it, the more tools you will gain.

## Miscellaneous Advice

This process doesn’t just work for reading great works. You can apply this to anything, and I advise you try it out with books and movies that you don’t like. While reading good books, you will add tools to your tool belt, but when you read the bad ones, you will learn what not to do. This list will help you avoid bad form and tired tropes.

Don’t get too lost in the weeds trying to find out what the author was *trying* to do. Focus on how it affects you and why. You should only care about the things pertaining to your research questions because of their relevance to your writing. If you go too deep then you risk copying the style of the author you’re learning from, or wasting time trying to decipher their intention. Instead, learn the things relevant to *your* writing so you can establish your own voice.

Write out the lessons that you learn. Keep a log of the things that you’ve learned and how you learned them. Returning to these notes will help keep your tools fresh in your brain. Over time you’ll build up your own personal style guide, and with enough practice, you’ll start using your tools without thinking about it.

## Jazz

Jazz musicians spend years learning and listening. They are experts in music theory. But when the best jazz musicians play, they don’t think about music theory. They channel feelings into music. The theory is in their bones. It’s no longer just an understanding of harmony but a new language – a language they use to speak in ways most can’t.

Read, watch, listen, and write until it is in your bones. Then when you sit down to write, you won’t have to think. You’ll channel feelings into story. The concepts you learned will be second nature. Story will be a language of your own, and that’s the mark of a master.",1

820,"Books where the blurb poorly describes the story?Anyone ever read a book and then after finishing it reread the blurb and realize it was a terrible description?

I'm listening to The White Tower right now and am almost done. I just reread the blurb and in hindsight it does a terrible job of telling what this book is about.

The events it describes do happen in the story but they are hardly the focal points of the story. Some happen very near the end, others are minor aspects of the characters journey.",1
821,"Literary/Epic/New Weird Fantasy in the vein of, say, Senlin Ascends?As the title implies, I'm on the hunt for a specific kind of book...more about the atmosphere and the prose, I think, than the plot. Though I won't say no to a solid plot. 

I want to read something that is literary in prose, epic in scale, and new weird in worldbuilding. If it has all three of those qualities, I'm a happy man -- but two out of three would do. I guess I should also add that I don't mind dark, but I'm not a huge fan of gritty for-the-sake-of; this is one reason I don't like Mieville all that much. While the Books of Babel can get dark, one of the reasons I love them so much is that they are hopeful where it counts: I think hopefulness is a big component that I need in a story in order to connect with it.

If it helps at all, my top three favorites are Lord of the Rings, Jonathan Strange, and Senlin. Perhaps there's a common thread between those three that I'm not seeing, other than the qualities I mention above (I know JS&amp;MN isn't necessarily *weird*, but there is a strange quality to the world due to all the Faerie stuff. Otherworldly, perhaps? That might be the word. It's there in LOTR, too). Whatever the case, any assistance you fine people can give me would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR -- Literary, epic, new weird: that's what I want to read. But not Mieville, thanks.",1
822,"Basilisk Reviews: Prosper's Demon by KJ Park - an absolutely stellar example of Parker's signature wit and humor. A wry, entertaining novella! *Thank you to Tor for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review! Prosper's Demon will be released on January 28th, 2020.*

[/r/Fantasy Bingo](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/r-fantasy-book-bingo/) Squares: Slice of Life (Hard Mode), Novella

Execution: ⭐⭐⭐⭐💫  
Enjoyment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I have an idea you aren’t going to like me very much. That may prove to be the only thing we’ll have in common, so let’s make the most of it.

Prosper’s Demon is an absolutely stellar example of KJ Parker's signature wit. As always, Parker's protagonist is more than a bit of an asshole, but you have to love the wry, humorous prose he's couched in. This would be a great entry point for someone new to Parker's short fiction, given how thoroughly it epitomizes the tone and characters he's known for. Although this novella shares a universe with [My Beautiful Life](http://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/2019/11/25/my-beautiful-life-by-kj-parker/), they are both stand-alone and independent of one another.

Parker has a penchant for nameless narrators, and Prosper’s Demon continues that trend. It’s an interesting stylistic choice, especially since it’s hardly noticeable up until you begin writing about the book in question. You start to write a sentence saying that &lt;narrator&gt; did such and such, and then you backtrack - wait, what’s his name? DID he have a name? Oh, huh, he *didn’t have a name*. Parker manages to draw you into the head of his characters so thoroughly that you never stop to consider the fact that you don’t even have a word to call them. It’s the purest of first person stream-of-consciousness style narrations, eliminating all the chaff. The reader is meant to BECOME the main character, to insert themselves into the novella, and to experience what it would be like to be such a complete and utter asshole themselves. It’s fascinating. 

The novella opens on, well, a murder scene. And I do mean *opens* on it - the very first sentence describes the corpse lying on the bed. It’s established quite quickly that our anonymous narrator is not the best person out there, given that he’s the murderer. Sure, a demon made him do it - but he also chose to put himself in a position that gave the demon and opening to sneak into him while he was asleep. But, regardless, it’s up to the reader whether or not the good he does balances out the bad, so off goes the body down a nice deep crevasse. Thus does Parker set the stage for this little demon hunting tale. 

&gt;I WOKE TO FIND her lying next to me, quite dead, with her throat torn out. The pillow was shiny and sodden with blood, like low-lying pasture after a week of heavy rain. The taste in my mouth was familiar, revolting, and unmistakable. I spat into my cupped hand; bright red. Oh, for crying out loud, I thought. Here we go again.

Really, though, our dear narrator is less of a hunter and more of a shepherd. The demons can’t die, but they can be shuffled along and weakened. He was born with the ability to see and interact with demons, which is quite rare in this world. He first encountered a demon all the way back when he was in his mother’s womb, when a demon attempted to hide in her and recover after having suffered a grievous injury. This did not go very well for the demon, and likely contributed quite a bit to the somewhat skewed moral compass our narrator now possesses. 

The narrator’s semi-lucrative demon-shepherding trade is sanctioned by the Church, though the demons are working on discrediting the whole institution altogether with mixed success. Sometimes he’s welcomed into villages, and other times he’s given the cold shoulder. On the whole, people are usually glad to see him when they need him but would very much prefer he not wear out his welcome after the demons have been exorcised. Largely, this is due to the fact that exorcisms are messy at best. It is not a clean process to extract a demon. They latch on to their host’s minds, and pulling them out tends to do quite a bit of damage. On the flip side, however, the demons aren’t a huge fan of the exorcism process either - it’s painful in a way that we mere mortals could never understand. Thus, sometimes the best option is to bargain with them and convince them that leaving on their own is in their best interests. 

&gt;Give me five minutes, It said. At which point, you have to make a decision. You consider the amount of damage It’s already done—in this case, a broken leg, because I’d heard it break, and almost certainly a rib or two, high chance of internal bleeding, the little bastards never can resist playing—and then you weigh the harm It’ll do if you leave It in there a moment longer against the havoc It could cause if you have to yank It out. Factor against all that the pain and trauma It’ll feel being extracted, of which It’s so very, very scared; and then you ask yourself, is It really so tired and hungry that It’ll risk being manhandled, or is It simply trying it on, the way They all do, 999 times in 1,000? 

This way of life is all well and good for dear Narrator, right up until he finds a demon inhabiting the premier scholar of their kingdom: the good Master Prosper. It’s quite a subtle little thing, and rather more aesthetically pleasing compared to the ones he’s used to (by which I mean that it looks like a *very* attractive young woman rather than the nasty crabby-gooey things he typically sees). He’s set to be the mentor for the Duchess’ as yet unborn child. Naturally, the unborn child also has a demon inside of it. All around, this is not a great situation for anyone - and so, he bargains. 

&gt;Fine, It said as It saw me scowling in at It through some poor devil’s eyes. I give up. I’ll go quietly. No, you won’t, I said. I’ve got a job for you. You what? You’re going to do something for me, I said. Or I’ll hurt you so badly you’ll remember the pain every day for the rest of your everlasting life. Two pale eyes gazed at me. If I’d been capable of pity, I’d have felt it. You’re serious, aren’t you? About the job, yes. And the pain. Completely stunned. Tens of thousands of years of existence, you think you’ve heard it all, but apparently not. You want me to help you? I nodded. Collaboration, I told It. It’s the next big thing.

In exchange for helping Prosper’s titular demon out with Prosper’s art project, the demon agrees to do a bit less harm in the short term. Sure, our narrator will be assisting with their long game plan, but at least the people in his own generation will feel a bit less pain for it. Tit for tat, after all. As mentioned above: Collaboration is the next big thing. And so, they embark on a quest of artistic vision: to create the large bronze statue in the world. It will be magnificent, glorious, a monument to mankind. It might even be worth the cost. There’s only one way to find out. 

It’s damned impressive how much *fun* Parker makes reading about asshole main characters. You love to hate them. They murder, they make horrible decisions, they lie and cheat and steal. But the prose is light, wry, and witty. His plotting makes it clear contextually that the main character is horrible, and so it never feels apologetic. If anything, it wallows in it, joyfully. Parker makes no attempt whatsoever to truly justify the actions of his characters, and it makes for an entertaining and hilarious read about awful human beings. It almost reminds me of a Quentin Tarantino film, if Tarantino wasn’t a foot fetishist and was actually witty. 

Anyway, the real takeaway here: I thoroughly enjoyed this novella, and you should read it too if you like witty assholes who shepherd around demons.

Legendary beasts and men banded together in a suicide mission to stop the war, meeting them in a final battle where the emperor and the dragonlord were killed. The five surviving soldiers who fought beside the dragons became the Draig D’Alikar, a group of fighters with the legacy to protect the kingdoms by carrying the bones of the dragonlord as weapons against their enemies.*

*But now, a young woman has been found who could be a powerful enough sagia to help the emperor be reborn. Only her two brothers, one a recently liberated apprentice who has his own secret power, and the other a drunk still trying to forget their father’s death, stand in the way of the generals bringing Emperor Abaddon back to life.*

*If only the emperor would remain dead, so all the other sagias could live.*

I know how and what people ate, that tables were loose boards, stuff like that, but aside from that, not much.

- was an inn run by a family, or was there staff?

- what kind of roles/jobs were there and who performed them? Things like cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, serving guests..?

- did locals frequent the inn for a drink or meal?

- how did the innkeeper get their supplies? Did they go to the local market, did merchants come to the inn to deliver?

- did the inn brew their own beer/ale/wine?

- how much would it cost to stay in an inn?

- would an inn keep regulars, like rent out rooms for an indefinite time?

Thank you so much!",1
826,"Dresden Files Read-Along: Small Favor Final Discussion***Please read this for schedule talk***

Oh boy. That was a ride. And a whole lot of important stuff happened. Ivy kidnapped, tortured, Nicodemus hoping to turn her and have a Fallen Archive. Marcone kidnapped and tortured. Mab stealing Harry's fire. Luccio and Harry flirting. The rescues of the aforementioned victims. Harry have premonition sight about the island. Elder Gruff. Strangling Nicodemus. Michael nearly killed. HOLY SHIT the end of this book is intense. And to top it all off, Charity calls Harry family and he scores a date with Luccio. Boy, oh boy, that was a RIDE.

And it won't be slowing down until Ghost Story. In fact, we're about to kick it up again next month and then March will bring Changes and hoo boy, newbies, that one is a doozy. Remember to tag spoilers for the newbies!

Which also means we'll need to figure out scheduling for April or May. I've got Ghost Story up for April already but once we finish Changes, we could read Side Jobs, the first short story collection. At the very least, I'm going to recommend you get Side Jobs anyways so we can read ""Aftermath"" with Changes. It takes place directly after the end of Changes from Murphy's POV. So if y'all want to read the whole collection, I'm down, but for sure I think we should tack ""Aftermath"" to the end of Changes. There are some others that are fun and add some flavor to what came before (Billy and Georgia's wedding) but that's the big one, at least until after Skin Game. There's one story in Brief Cases I think we should read before Peace Talks/with Skin Game that we'll talk more about after Changes. We could also read Brief Cases in full after Skin Game as well giving everyone time to *get* Peace Talks.

I am open to suggestions. We could also do a read of the comics as well. They all slot in various points in between books and function a lot like the shorts. I'll have a comment down below for opinions on what to do here.

828,"The sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang – my review (and it’s not all good)This book is the front runner for the SPFBO and I’m yet to see a single review about it that isn’t glowing. An deservingly so! This book oozes character and atmosphere. It’s fresh, surprising and it packs a punch that leaves you breathless on the floor.

I didn’t like it.

Because I can’t really talk about this book without going into spoiler territory, I’ll provide a quick description first and my impressions broadly.

It takes place in a Fantasy world on a peninsula in an empire heavily inspired by feudal Japan. The magic system is very similar to the one in Avatar: the last airbender. The protagonists are Misako, a housewife who used to have a violent past and Mamoru, her first 14 year old first born. They belong to a noble warrior class rumored to be the best in the world, able to control water and ice, and Mamoru is training to be the best of the bests. 

Once again it’s a powerful story and you should read it. As for me I have a couple of nitpicks that I could have easily ignore but what really stopped me from enjoying it was the pacing. It was too damn slow. It was intense when it needed to be, but the rest of the time I just kept turning pages waiting for the next story beat. Unfortunately in order to discuss about it more, I’ll have to go into spoiler territory. Don’t read further if you haven’t read the book first.

-------------------------------------------------


Ok, so here are my issues. I already know what you’re going to answer for each of my point: that it was the point, that I didn’t understand what the author was trying to do, that I’m the one being wrong and that I’m a dumbass and I deserve to die a painful death for having this opinion. I completely agree with you. I understand completely what the author was trying to do and I know that I’m the one being wrong, but understanding it is different from enjoying it so I consider my opinion valid nonetheless.

First the pacing. There are two parts in the books. The before and the after with a huge battle in the middle. There is an interesting confrontation between Mamoru and his father during the first part and there is an interesting and powerful confrontation between Misako and his husband. I found those scenes very good but unfortunately I was bored out of my mind between those scenes. The worst part was those long scenes after the huge battle where everyone is mourning their loss. I understand the point of those scenes but it was both painful and boring. I think my problem is that I have to root for the protagonist in order to enjoy they journey, and I did ended up rooting for them at the end, but at first I just wanted to slap them in the face until they stopped being morons. I was surprised with the death of Mamoru. It was a ballsy move, even since George RR Martin I kind of expect something like that every time there are several POV.

I also have issues with the worldbuilding. It felt incoherent. At first it looked like a medieval setting but they kept mentioning modern appliance elsewhere in the world and it was jarring. I didn’t know if I was in “Avatar the last airbender” or if I was in “Legend of Korra”. They didn’t provide any explanation why only one character had a smartphone for instance. This community was very traditional but they weren’t luddites either. And on the other hand there wasn’t any “practical” application of their power. When a sensible portion of your population has magic power we should expect for it to be used outside battle scenes. There were one or two instances where they used it to wash themselves or to solidify a structure but it was pretty limited, specially for a village of fishermen where I can imagine a buttload of useful applications.

Also, why use Japanese for so many words? I wasn’t lost because it turned out that I studied Japanese in the past but not everyone is like me. I imagine it would just complicate their understanding of the story. Why use weird units for the time? Why not call a teacher a teacher instead of a sensei? I’m French so does it mean that I could also create an exotic fantasy world by randomly saying some of the nouns in French? Instead of saying “ the student had to pick up his sword in order to meet his fencing teacher” I could write “the étudiant had to pick up his épée in order to meet his escrime professeur”. Is it exotic enough for you?

I also felt frustrated by the lack of resolution with a lots of narrative setup. What’s the story with those orphans being kidnapped? How did it turned out with the empire now that the village had its eyes opened? I discovered after the fact that the story is a kind of prequel for a series with Robin and his son so I imagine I’ll have to read the rest to really understand.

My last issue is very personal but I hate hate HATE the trope about the oppressed that end up falling in love with her oppressor. When I discovered how Misaki was being treated by her abusive husband I kept praying for the story not to go there and unfortunately my prayers were not answered. I was ok for him to redeem himself. I was ok for her to forgive him. I was not ok for her to fall in love with him in the end. You can provide all the justification that you want: how he changed, how he stared seeing her as an equal. Bullshit! It stinks of the Stockholm syndrome.

I apologize for this long review. Once again, I acknowledge that this is a good book and it’s just not for me. I usually hate writing bad review about books from new authors because I they need all the help they can have but because I felt alone with my opinion I had to exorcise it somehow. 

This is just me: it’s a truly powerful book and all the problems are on my side.",1
829,"The Ghost Bride (based on a book by Yangsze Choo) is now on Netflix!I really enjoyed [**The Ghost Bride**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248223-the-ghost-bride) by Yangsze Choo. It's a ghost story/murder mystery set in 1890s Malaysia. Lim Tian Ching, the spoiled son of a rich family died unmarried, and his mother seeks to find him a wife who would marry him postmortem, so he would not spend eternity alone and to placate his spirit. Her choice falls on Pan Li Lan, the daughter of an impoverished spice trader. This would help Li Lan's family, but at the cost of her happiness. Then Tian Ching starts visiting her in her dreams, Li Lan gets drawn into the ghost world and has to untangle the secrets of the Lim family.

In Alix E. Harrow, I see a respect for stories and words and the power they hold equal to that of Ursula K. Le Guin. If you’ve followed me awhile, you know the depth of this compliment and if you haven’t, boy, have I a few recommendations for you. But this isn’t about Ursula, it’s about *The Ten Thousand Doors of January,* a novel that takes a magnifying glass and points it at the connection between stories, the worlds they originate from and those who are brave enough to explore them.

January Scaller is a unique girl, though in what way may not become readily apparent. True, she is “a perfectly unique specimen,” as her guardian, Mr. Locke puts it, a child grown up under the wing of this most affluent personage. “A perfectly unique specimen, odd-colored perhaps but not colored” is the description this man, almost a father to her, gives January early on. It is the turn of the 20th century, and this is America – if you needed a reminder of the disquiet, the sheer horrible racist reality of that time, the following sentence, from the view of a seven-year old, encapsulates it well: “I didn’t really know what made a person colored or not, but the way he \[Mr. Locke\] said it made me glad I wasn’t.” See, in only a few paragraphs, Harrow has given us a conflicting view of the man January considers a father figure.

Not that January doesn’t have a father; it is merely that he, Julian Scaller, spends most of his time tracking treasures and rare objects for his employer, the very same Mr. Locke. Cornelius Locke is something of a collector, you see, and his home would make even the Smithsonian seem an enthusiast’s collection by comparison. January’s father is his most successful agent, owed to Julian’s ability to follow stories to their source – the stories of people and of places, the origins behind their myths

It is a talent his daughter seems to have inherited, for it isn’t the dotting of a millionaire that makes her “a perfectly unique specimen” but the hunger she feels for stories and adventures, for the world outside the confines of Locke House. Like many of you who now read this review – like me – January escapes the tedium of her everyday reality through novels – penny dreadfuls and adventure stories, the horror and excitement of the grotesque. And when, on her seventeenth birthday, life throws at her the very worst it has to offer, it’s into a book that she escapes.

&gt;**“…(see how that word slips into even the most mundane of stories? Sometimes I feel there are doors lurking in the creases of every sentence, with periods for knobs and verbs for hinges).**

The Villains (see the shape of the V, how it places opposites on its two ends, mirroring one another and yet different?) of *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* range from the universal gothic of the time period to the deeply personal, the kind of villain to kill for – if you’ll pardon the pun.

Its the language, the melodious nature of it that is enchanting to the reader. The masterful control over character voice is equally impressive – a sizable portion of the book adopts the tenets of an epistolary novel, making use of a voice very different from January’s own:

&gt;**The following monograph concerns the permutations of a repeated motif in world mythologies: passages, portals, and entryways. Such a study might at first seem to suffer from those two cardinal sins of academia—frivolity and triviality—but it is the author’s intention to demonstrate the significance of doorways as phenomenological realities.**  
**At least, that is the book I intended to write, when I was young and arrogant. Instead, I’ve written something strange, deeply personal, highly subjective. I am a scientist studying his own soul, a snake swallowing its own tail.**

Harrow’s use of these chapters to tell several stories serves to pace January’s own tale and to create additional tension early on,

I return then to Alix Harrow’s respect of words, captured best in the following: “**Words and their meanings have weight in the world of matter, shaping and reshaping realities through a most ancient alchemy.**” This is at the heart of our culture, did you know? Our society and we as members of it, invent and reinvent ourselves through the process of the word, written or spoken. Our civilization rests on the written word, where many have perished before, their words once spoken but no longer heard. And this novel *gets it*, understands the importance of words and their ability to change minds and hearts and the paths we make for ourselves.

There’s also the emotional connection – something deeply individual for all readers – but the novel and its characters, their suffering and loss and love and joy as they realized themselves in full, all this found resonance in me. About mid-way through, I even teared up, and there’s nothing like a few tears to illustrate how deeply you connect to a text on an emotional level.

I’m under the impression that this novel is a standalone – and I would like to praise the author for her choice; *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* accomplishes in one book what many series don’t manage in three – a complete story from beginning to end, which leaves the door…not sealed, not entirely, but firmly closed.

I give *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* a score of 5/5 stars; if I were using a ten-point system, I’d give it a 9.5 out of 10 because the ending plays it a little bit too safe and the epilogue, while a wonderful way to say goodbye to the characters, wasn’t necessary. Almost as if Harrow wanted one last moment with these characters – something I can hardly blame her for.

My recommendation goes out to all those among you who are in love with the magic of words and stories, those of you who feel a certain disquiet when they think of having to spend a lifetime going through the motions; *The Ten Thousand Doors* is for adventurers and travelers and seekers. Take a look – I wager you won’t regret it.

842,"The color out of space - The best evoker of creepiness and dread?I just read Lovecraft's the color out of space.

Now, Lovecraft is very well known for being able to arouse (not like that) dread in his stories but truth be told, I'm not someone who's felt this way after trying to force myself to read 'the mountains of madness' and 'call of cthulhu'. I've completed my readings of 'the nameless city' (though there were good parts to this one) and 'the festival' and was almost similarly unimpressed.

&amp;nbsp;

However the color out of space is a different beast altogether. Lovecraft managed to evoke dread via so many means: the fear of the people who lived near Nahum, the dread of his friend, the land itself perishing, Nahum's family succumbing to madness, animals seized by terror, all these devices just brought about a sense of fear and hopelessness about this situation. I've read novels that've tried to evoke a sense of dread but I've found myself unmoved by them, here however the very *world* around Nahum's farm is touched by the horror of the story. Nahum's friend Ammi is scarred by the dread he felt when he visited his friend so long ago (the events of the story took place many years ago, possibly five decades ago), and he makes you understand just how terrifying it was for him to force himself to go check on his friend every so often. His very choices were also influenced by his fear (for example taking the long way when leaving Nahum's home, just to stay away from where the meteor had landed).

&amp;nbsp;

Then you have the very plant life around Nahum's home. The fruits growing to large sizes and full of vibrant colors, but within they were unfit to consume, as though something fundamental had gone wrong. First the trees succumbed to whatever was ailing the land and the grass was untouched, but then so was the grass and their livestock. Their animals grew sickly and shriveled, almost as though some alien radiation was ravaging them. The very *world* around Nahum's home was just *wrong*. Even the image of the sun changed once you were within a certain radius of the meteor.

&amp;nbsp;

And the people of the surrounding lands, they were too scared to ever go near Nahum's home. They chose to instead find *other* ways so they didn't have to experience his lands. So great was their fear that even in the framing story they'd decided it was all myth and that no one should ever believe Ammi, as though they could hide the horrors of Nahum's farm by simply forgetting it or treating it as a myth.

&amp;nbsp;

Nahum's wife and one of his sons both going mad, now THIS had some of the strangest nuance I'd ever read, as it mentioned that though they both screamed and screamed, it was though they communicated to one another in some alien form by their very screams. Nahum's wife had somehow been made privy to...knowledge? Sights? Something that was breaking her mind. By the end of it all, she is consumed by whatever is living in the lands, not out of malice, but because the color does not seem to recognize sentience or people, just that it feeds as it wishes. Ammi is then pushed to kill what she's become because he fears that it is a great evil to just leave her as is.

&amp;nbsp;

All this and the 'creature' is not one with a face that can show hunger/anger/delight or whatever. The very 'creature', the color, does not even make itself evident for much of the story, the dread is what is built up first before we've ever even seen it. An entire story with a creature that doesn't even have a form, it's almost unthinkable to imagine how a storyteller could tell an entire story with this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not crazy about everything Lovecraft's written, but this story has been so powerful. I'm not going to say I'm a fan of his prose, but he certainly does amazing things with imagery. I'm hoping to one day finish 'the mountains of madness' as I really think it'll be one of my favorites if I can just get past the part where they finally reach the mountains (it's so tedious up until that point, but then this was also the first story of his I'd read so it's possible I wasn't yet accustomed to his way of writing). I really haven't read any other story that knew how to evoke such feelings of dread without being so heavy handed with it.",1

844,"Shadow of what was Lost issueI like the book. It hits some nostalgic tropes which I'm craving right now.

I'm almost done with book 1, about 2 or 3 chapters left but there was an issue bothering me that I couldn't figure out till now.

It's their age. I can't place it.

The cast starts off at a school setting before they go off on their journey and so I assumed and put them somewhere in their mid-teens. They also don't act/think like adults, but more adolescent.

My issue is that they're not exactly acknowledged as under-age. Sometimes the term 'lad' is used, but it's not really reflected well with the attitude and behaviors other characters have to the main cast. Most if not all interactions with Davian, Wirr, Asha, Dezia, Aelric, and Karaliene are very ""equal"" as if theyre adults themselves. Their age isn't really an issue to other characters especially during the more eventful scenes where you'd think it would.

Maybe I've assumed wrong and they're in their early 20s. Can anyone help me with this?

Thanks!",1
845,"My 2019 Hard Mode Bingo CardI've finally completed my bingo card! This card was largely inspired by /u/thequeensownfool whose own cards from last year gave me plenty of ideas about what to read and whose great contributions to the Author Appreciation series provided other great things to read. [Here is a photo of completed card](https://imgur.com/a/uQte3sD) and a brief review of each book:

**First Row**

Slice of Life / Small Scale Fantasy (Not record of a Spaceborn Few) – **The Gray House** by Mariam Petrosyan

* After /u/improperly_paranoid/ talked this book up at length, I decided to check it out. The book is a grade A door stopper at close to 750 pages but it reads a lot quicker than it seems like it should partly because the story is really engaging and partly because the novel is dialogue-heavy which makes the story both flow more quickly while also taking up less page space than it could. The characters are well realized and the House itself is so well sketched as a vaguely unsettling weird place that has such an effect on their lives and carries such odd and unique traditions within it. It does take a few hundred pages for the true plot to kick in (and for the magical realist elements of the story to assert themselves) but the characters and their idiosyncrasies are so compelling that I found it easy to read through the somewhat plotless first third without difficulty. A remarkable book that's worth checking out. 4/5

A SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability (Main Character) – **Six of Crows** by Leigh Bardugo

* Six of Crows was a fun read and a lot more violent than I was expecting for a teen fantasy novel. Main character Kaz Brekker is permanently crippled and needs to use a cane but his injury has basically turned him into a fantasy Walter White, willing to do anything and everything it takes to gain power and get revenge on those who wronged him. The world was rather interesting and I enjoyed the magic system. The heist aspect of the book was solid though sometimes it felt like the situation wasn't explained quite well enough for me to visualize exactly what was happening with each team member in order for the mission to be pulled off successfully. 3.5/5

SFF Novella (not Tor Published) – T**he Tea Master and the Detective** by Aliette de Bodard

* I read this while pretty sick so I think I probably missed some details that take this story from good to great but I still liked it a lot. The way Bodard updated Holmes and Watson for a sci fi setting was rather ingenious (I particularly like making Watson a sentient spaceship/apothecary). The characters are well realized though I wished they had had a greater variety of interactions since much of this book is characterized by antagonism between them that seemed to resolve into friendship rather abruptly. Maybe this is an area where the book was constrained by being an update of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories but since I've never actually read the first one, I can't be sure. Regardless, it's a satisfying and well written mystery  that's easy to read through in a single sitting. 4.5/5

Self-Published SFF Novel (&lt;50 GR ratings) – **The Final Lesson** by Shakyra Dunn

* I combed the 2018 SPFBO entries looking for an author with under 50 ratings to find Dunn and while not the best book I read this year, it was an enjoyable one. The magic system is a bit conventional but the character relationships are strong with the central character of Leilana learning to be nearer to humanity so that the cost of her magical powers won't eventually drive her mad. There were also a few surprising and bold choices in the writing including an early betrayal from a character who seemed to sweet and innocent to do that sort of thing (which also served as a great example of why it was so important that Leilana learns to connect to humanity before her powers consume her). The plotting was a bit uneven after the strong opening though and some of the dialogue could be a bit too expository but I still came away mostly enjoying it. 3/5

SFF Novel Featuring Twins (as protagonists) – **Black Tides of Heaven** by JY Yang

* Twins Mokoya and Akeha are powerful in a loosely explained magical power called slackcraft and they are seen by their mother, the Protector of the Tensorate, as the key to controlling the people. A rift comes between them near their 18th birthday when Mokoya reveals that they want to be confirmed as a woman upon her 18th birthday (children in this world are kept genderless until they choose which gender to become in a confirmation ceremony where they are magically and surgically ushered through puberty in a day) and Akeha chooses to become a man out of spite. This simple sibling rupture captures a lot of interesting ideas about gender and power and sibling relationships and I found myself really enjoying it. My one complaint is that since it is so short (barely 240 pages) it often felt like the plot was rushing and major events were being skipped over where I would have appreciated them being drawn out more. Regardless, it was a great read. 4.5/5

**Second Row**

Novel Featuring Vampires (as protagonists) – **Sunshine** by Robin McKinley

* I've heard such good things about Robin McKinley and in the big recommendation thread quite a few people mentioned this as being one of her best and a perfect fit for this square so I figured this was a good time to finally try her works. This book is chock full of personality and a unique approach to both magic and vampirism that made it immediately interesting to me. Set in a world full of demons and magic that have remade society into a loosely defined worldwide defensive pact between humans to protect themselves from an encroaching menace of vampires. Within this world, Rae is a sunlight mage who finds that as long as she is holding hands with a Vampire (specifically Constantine) she can grant them temporary immunity from burning up in the daylight. The novel is fast paced and has tons of fascinating worldbuilding. I found it very easy to read hundreds of pages in a single sitting because of how captivating the voice was. 4/5

Format: Graphic Novel (new to you) – **Heathen** by Natasha Alterici

* In the big rec thread, /u/E_L_Sonder told me about this graphic novel and it sounded perfect for my needs. Heathen is a fantastic graphic novel about a lesbian Viking warrior who wishes to overthrow the old order because it sentenced her to death for daring to kiss another woman. To this end, she sets out to free the Valkyrie leader, Brynhild, and together they decide to overthrow the god-king Odin.  Everything from the art to the characterization in this volume was striking. The characters are already fully realized and feel so real and varied. Every character has a strong motivation for something and a lot of personality to work with that already makes the world feel so rich. Though not much happens in this first volume, I am intrigued to see where this story goes. 4/5

SFF Novel by a Local to You Author (closest local author you can find) – **Twenty-Sided Sorceress** by Annie Bellet

* Portland has no shortage of great spec fic authors to choose from but I ultimately decided to challenge myself to pick someone I'd never heard of (otherwise I would have just wound up reading Le Guin yet again which, while great, reading plenty of authors I already know I like probably isn't in the spirit of this challenge) and wound up with this interesting number. An urban fantasy in the mold of Iron Druid, this book follows sorceress Jade Crow, a magic-user who can imitate any D&amp;D spell she's ever red with the help of a d20 magical focus, as she tries to protect a magical community of shifters (people who can transform into animals) from being killed by a warlock. The pacing is tight and the plot kicks in quickly but the short length of the novel also means that emotionally meaningful moments happen a bit too quickly to really land with a key example being that Jade and her eventual love interest share maybe 10 full pages of time together during which they swing from intense hatred to all-consuming love. However, the plot is interesting and the world gets built pretty quickly so I would call it an entertaining read. 3/5

SFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting (over 50% ocean setting) – **Circe** by Madeline Miller

* I'm not 100% positive that this is exactly ""over 50% ocean setting"" but Circe is a naiad (water nymph) who lives a significant portion of her life underwater and sometimes sails places and even when she's not in the water she lives on a small island surrounded by nothing but ocean and thinks often of the sea so I'm guessing it's close enough no one will give me a hard time about it. This book is a fascinating character study of the semi evil sorceress of The Odyssey and Miller does a great job capturing her complexity and making her sympathetic. The book is half love letter to Greek mythology, half empowered revisionism as Miller spins exciting webs of connection between Circe and other gods/heroes. I really enjoyed this one and can easily see why it won the Goodreads best fantasy novel category in 2018. 4/5

Cyberpunk (not Neuromancer, not Snow Crash) – **Synners** by Pat Cadigan

* I had never heard of Pat Cadigan until I deliberately Googled for female cyberpunk authors and learned pretty immediately there is a widely acknowledged queen of cyberpunk who has been just as influential and prolific as Gibson. This book was...a trip. I'm lost for other words to describe it with. The prose is jazzy and clips at a good pace but the parachuting in method of storytelling and what seems like a very loose focus on several characters who are unrelated to each other for large sections of the book rather than on a straightforward plot makes the book difficult to follow. I was more than halfway through the novel before I finally caught on to what was happening. Despite all that, I still think it was a good book but I'd probably have to reread it very carefully to actually make sure. A fascinating, if confusing, work that makes me intrigued to check out more from the author. 3/5

**Third Row**

2nd Chance (already hard) – **The Thief** by Megan Whalen Turner

* This book is often thrown around as an underrated gem that more people should read but I have to say that the first time I read it, it was a slog without characters that interested me and I couldn't see what people liked about it. Sadly, rereading it only improved the experience a little bit. There are moments which are clever in hindsight once you know the ending but I find that the book is bogged down by tons of pointless detail as if the focus of the story were on describing lunches rather than planning a daring theft. Whole sections stop dead to describe the food the main character, Gen, and the magus and the guards eat or the inn they stay at but little happens that is actually meaningful. The characters begin as rudimentary cutouts that eventually develop mild amounts of character but it never goes much further than archetypal characterization (the nice guard and the mean guard, the ambitious mage, the clever thief, etc.). The best parts of the book are easily the stories about the gods that the characters sometimes tell each other which is frustrating because those stories are straight lore dumps but they display far more economical storytelling than the rest of the book. There's actually a paragraph in the book that stops what little plot there is so one of the guards can recite a list of trivial facts about a nearby country (including primary imports *and* exports!) leading to Gen making fun of how boring and uninteresting such a bland recitation of pointless info is but, honestly, that section didn't seem all too different from the way the rest of the book is written. 1.5/5 stars.

Afrofuturism (&lt;1000 GR ratings) – **The New Moon’s Arms** by Nalo Hopkinson

* Here's the first author I got to check out from /u/thequeensownfool's Author Appreciation threads that helped me fill out my bingo card. The book has a lot of things going on from a magical realist plot about the main character beginning to attract lost objects to her to a somewhat sci fi near future plot about a subset of humanity evolving into mermaids off the coast of a fictional Caribbean island to an exploration of sexuality and aging. Because the book jumps around in time, the main character has fantasies that sometimes blur the line between real and imagined events, and the book is written in a Caribbean-infused dialect of English, it can be surprisingly hard to unpack what I think is ultimately a straightforward story. The book is certainly interesting and well written but the difficulty in piecing everything together for a fairly simple story about family and belonging did hamper my enjoyment of it a bit. 3/5

SFF Novel Published in 2019 (debut) – **Descendant of the Crane** by Joan He

* Princess Hesina is hell bent on uncovering who murdered her father but what she actually uncovers is conspiracy after conspiracy arrayed against her. This book was well-paced and the plot is quite strong with several twists that kept hooking me in. The characters were fantastic from Hesina to Akira to Caiyan, all are given moments to shine and to impress you as a reader and they never disappoint. The Chinese-inspired world may be a little rote in execution with predictable elements like wise sages and Confucianist religious elements but the magic system that is laid out (which I can't really explain too much of without spoiling the book) is interesting and opens the door for lots of possibilities in the sequel. Lastly, the themes of good governance and oppression, while perhaps standard for a fantasy book like this, were handled quite well especially in how Ms. He showed the psychological and emotional toll it took on Hesina to rule when she was forced to take actions she disagreed with even if they were for the greater good. 4/5

Middle Grade SFF Novel (not a reread) – **Akata Witch** by Nnedi Okorafor

* I was pretty worried about this square. I mean, YA is one thing but can I really find a book meant explicitly for only 8-14 year olds that would actually be good? It turns out: yes, quite easily and it'll wind up being so good it was my favorite thing I read in 2019. Okorafor is beloved for her Binti series (which I haven't read yet) and from this book I can see why. I was blown away by her style and command of characters right from the first chapter. Reading this book was like reading your first fantasy for the very first time all over again because of the unique influences she pulls in that I have not seen portrayed in this genre before. The characters are well done and extremely likable, the world is fascinating, and I could not put this book down. Consider me hooked. 5/5

A Personal Recommendation from [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy) (not the most recommended) – **Miranda in Milan** by Katherine Duckett

* You can see me asking for recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b83oxq/the_2019_rfantasy_bingo_recommendations_list/ejvr8n7/?context=3) along with the responses I got. It looked like of the recommendations I was given, Becky Chambers and RF Kuang were the most popular so I couldn't use them here for hard mode. Of the recommendations that were left (and there were more than a few interesting ones), I wound up most drawn to Miranda in Milan. The story follows Miranda, daughter of the sorcerer Prospero (characters from Shakespeare's The Tempest), after they have returned to Italy so Prospero can reclaim his dukedom. Miranda begins to learn of society as she struggles with the realization that she is gay (something she had not known before having grown up on an island with only men) with the help of her maid, Dorothea. The plot begins to ramp up when Miranda realizes that her father has really returned to wreak revenge and she must figure out what his purpose is and how to stop him. The story is well paced, well written, full of interesting characters, and hard to put down. 4.5/5

**Fourth Row**

Any [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy) Book Club Book of the Month OR [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy) Read-along Book (current and participate) – **City of Brass** by SA Chakraborty

* This book had been on my list for a while and it was a pleasure to finally knock it off. City of Brass focuses on djinn society in the Middle East (or Daevas as the call themselves) and is a masterclass in worldbuilding. Every location is imbued with so much history and personality in a way few travel narratives ever are. The magic and the creatures that inhabit the world are intriguing and fascinating with minor twists on classic middle eastern folklore that make them recognizable yet also singular. Many of the characters were interesting and great to follow though the plot could sometimes drag, especially in the chapters where the prince  of the djinn was the POV character. Overall though, I enjoyed it a good bit and I'm excited to read the sequel. 4/5

Media Tie-In Novel (not Star Wars) – **Mass Effect Andromeda: Annihilation** by Catherynne M Valente

* I thought for sure this would be the worst square but was pleasantly surprised to find a genuinely great media tie in novel. I'd never read Valente before this square (despite many great users here assuring me she is a talented writer) but with this as an indication of how well she writes, I'm prepared to cosign that she is indeed a great talent. Set in the Mass Effect world (which my girlfriend went to great lengths to get me into at the beginning of last year), the novel follows all of the lesser races of the galaxy (elcor, batarian, volus, hanar, and drell) as they attempt to travel to a new galaxy to colonize it only for an unexpected virus to begin infecting all species on the ship and killing them off - something which should be impossible for any virus since cross species contamination is rare. The novel is witty and carefully considered with each character getting moments of great humor and great introspection that truly builds their character. By far the best character was an elcor doctor who wanted to be a Shakespearean actor named Yorrik who steals scene after scene. I really enjoyed this and if anyone is interested, I'd highly recommend getting the audiobook version where the narrator has access to all of the vocal effects that the various races have in game since it makes it a bit easier to tell all of the characters apart. 4/5

Novel Featuring an AI Character (as protagonist) – **Ancillary Sword** by Ann Leckie

* After Leckie made a huge splash with Ancillary Justice in the far back forgotten year of 2014, I rushed to pick up the first book in this series and enjoyed it immensely. It's really a shame I waited until this long to check out the sequel but sci-fi really isn't my usual hobby horse and there were tons of great fantasy to read. Breq, the AI formerly known as the warship Justice of Toren, is charged by the Lord of the Radch herself with unearthing disparate consciousnesses of the Lord of the Radch that are fighting with herself and causing chaos throughout the Radch Empire. While Breq remains an interesting character in her own right, this book lacks the tight focus of the original on Breq's revenge and the pacing suffers for it. Leckie juggles several complicated plotlines pretty well and makes what should be a more confusing plot easy to follow but the story doesn't advance nearly as much as I thought it would for the second part of a three part series. Ultimately, I'd say the book is solid to good but a far cry from its predecessor. I can only hope the finale, Ancillary Mercy, can bring it all back home with some of the pizzaz that the original book had. 3.5/5

SFF Novel That Has a Title of Four or More Words (7 words or more) – **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

* Our beloved bingo hosts have been hyping up this book for years so it only made sense that I should finally check it out. And, unsurprisingly, the hype is deserved. The novel is joyous in celebrating the interactions between all of the diverse species and in its optimism about our ability to fit into a galactic federation of some sort in the future. The characters were incredible, so varied and multi-faceted with each having at least one quality that makes them lovable and distinct in addition to coming from highly interesting cultures. At times, this book reminded me of the best of classic Star Trek for its sheer utopianism and creativity but the the novel never fails to always center the text squarely back on the characters and their relationships with each other as a believable makeshift family. I can't recommend this book more highly. 5/5

Retelling! (of an already published book) – **Miranda and Caliban** by Jacqueline Carey

* I guess technically Shakespeare's The Tempest is a play and not a book but hopefully that's small potatoes and besides, I couldn't resist getting in two books about Miranda on the same bingo card. This book reimagines Miranda and Caliban growing up together as rebellious children who long to become lovers despite Prospero's insistence that they never interact. Dealing with themes of betrayal and knowledge, it's an interesting look at forbidden love. Though the prose is not as good as Miranda in Milan, it was generally good overall and I enjoyed the characters as they were written. My biggest complaint is that it stays too true to the ending of The Tempest where I would have preferred it if Carey had played around with it a bit more like Duckett did in her book. Still a worthwhile read though. 3.5/5

**Fifth Row**

SFF Novel by an Australian Author (small press or self-pubbed) – **The Swan Book** by Alexis Wright

* I decided to try making this square even more challenging by seeking out Aboriginal Australian auathors for this square and I was not disappointed by what I found. The Swan takes place in a dystopian future where climate change has ruined the world and aboriginal Australians live under a kind of tyranny from the transformed Australian government. The book has an unusual bitter fairy tale tone due to the protagonist (Oblivia) being caught in a kind of arrested development where she remains childlike well into adulthood. The prose is stellar and the unique tone makes this dystopian novel oddly enchanting even as it lashes out with ferocious political satire against past Australian abuses of aboriginal peoples. It's a remarkable book in many ways though it does require a ton of attention to ferret out what the narration is getting at sometimes since Oblivia relays what happens but in a detached and not always factual manner. 4/5

The Final Book of a Series (published more than a decade ago) – **Assassin’s Quest** by Robin Hobb

* Aha! My laziness in taking months or even years to finish series finally pays off! I was never the biggest fan of this series, I thought the first book was only okay and I only read the second one (which was good but I still didn't think it was great) after being blown away by Liveship Traders. This book is easily the best of the trilogy. Here, I finally see Hobb reaching the levels of writing talent that would amaze me in Liveship Traders. Fitz's lonely quest to assassinate his uncle, Regal, is surprisingly moving given that he's cut off from just about every character we've grown to know over the past two books for much of this book. How Robin Hobb managed to tell such a great story while also isolating her main character and eliminating interpersonal interactions with most of the other likable characters for more than half of the book, I'll never know but it's an incredible feat for any writer to pull off. The conclusion of this trilogy is a well stuck landing that wraps up several loose threads in a satisfying way. Now I'm excited to see where the successor series go from here. 4.5/5

\#OwnVoices (author and protagonist share 2+ marginalized identities) – **An Unkindness of Ghosts** by Rivers Solomon

* This story essentially reproduces the set up of the United States' antebellum South on a spaceship that's supposed to be ferrying everyone to a promised land and the main character, Aster, is a talented doctor who is given semi-privileged status despite her dark skin because of her talent. Aster is a unique character who exists in several liminal spaces: she's both privileged from the point of view of the women she works with and not privileged enough to avoid being harassed by the guards and overseers, she is a revolutionary but finds herself often having to aid the upper class she wants to rebel against, she was born a woman but uses her medical knowledge to try to erase her womanhood to avoid being sexualized (often preferring to be called ""they"" though the story still calls her ""her"" frequently which lead to some uncertainty over which pronouns I should use to refer to her in this post). All of these characteristics make for a truly engaging protagonist who manages to carry much of the book alongside the equally compelling Surgeon, a light-skinned black man who occupies a position of authority by virtue of the fact that he can pass for white. The worldbuilding here is excellent and the prose is often just as good. Unfortunately the book is hampered by incredibly slow pacing, taking close to 70 pages before the plot kicks in, and chapter beginnings would often feel disjointed since they usually began in media res of a new action (and sometimes on a new day) without connecting back to the previous chapter. It's a solid if sometimes uneven read from a promising new writer. 3.5/5

LitRPG (written by female author) – **The Luckless** by AM Sohma

* I'm generally not a fan of LitRPG. I get why people are a fan of it and it can be creative and interesting but as a genre, but it tends to be far more interested in the aspects of writing I find least interesting and least interested in the aspects I adore. The Luckless is about a girl who is trapped in an online fantasy quest due to a server malfunction and must try to beat the game's supposedly unbeatable final boss which will automatically boot her from the full virtual reality immersion tank she will most likely be trapped in otherwise. It's basically just the first arc of Sword Art Online but with a ticking clock added to drive up the tension (and the good part of SAO but with more tension is a compliment as far as I'm concerned). That said, I'm still not really a fan of this genre so the constant stopping to explain battle mechanics in detail really wore on me and slowed down the pacing despite the clever conceit and likable characters. Still, I was able to get through it so I guess I'll call it passable. 2.5/5

Five SFF Short Stories (anthology or collection) – **Ancient, Ancient** by Kiina Ibura Salaam

* This was another author I found through /u/thequeensownfool. Salaam is a fascinating writer with a real focus on sensuality, the destruction of bodies, predatory behaviors, misery, cycles of abuse, and empathy in the face of all those things. Her writing has an almost hypnotic quality to it and her best stories (such as MalKai's Last Seduction and K-USH: The Legend of the Last Wero) really meditate on human connection in the face of isolation. The downside of these stories is that, while they are all incredibly inventive and packed with unique mythologies, they can be tricky to follow because of how many unexplained mysteries there are. I found the best way to read this collection is to almost tune out the magic and tech to just focus on the emotions of the main characters which are the real centerpiece of the story but even that can fall flat in some of the weaker entries. A good and interesting book that probably demands a more thorough and thoughtful examination of its content than I had time to give it. 3.5/5

Overall Bingo Card Score: 3.74/5",1
846,"Has any author you enjoy done the ""last-minute change"" right? (""DeathDragon Anubis"" by Stu Harrington)I posted some art to my SMs earlier this morning of a dragonborn wielding magic, and made a comment about regretting not having given my MC (who is basically a dragonborn, for simplicity) the potential to do the same.

The response was *instantaneous*, and very surprising.

A *lot* of people commented with an echo of ""It's not too late!"" which really took me aback. The series involving the MC in question is 5 books long, and likely going to wrap with a 6th, and I've really become set on the story and path it's going to take, without any large interest to deviate with last-minute changes like this.

I don't intend to make this shift in my story. Raz's tale is writing itself at this point, and magic is not likely a part of his personal arsenal, but after this morning's response to the art in question, I'm *very* curious as to if anyone has suggestions for authors who have made last-minute changes or additions to their MCs/story, and done it well. I've seen it done, but can't think of a single time I've enjoyed the change, but if it's *possible* I would love samples to learn from. It's an odd weapon to add to the writer's arsenal, but I won't say no to anything that might come in useful one day!

ps: marking this as ""spoiler"" preemptively. if/when answering, please remember to follow Rule 2 of the sub.

pps: attaching the art, in case people wanted to see what I meant.

847,"Fantasy Bingo - mini YA book reviewsI've been meaning to do a series of bingo reviews for a while, and kept putting it off because the task seemed so daunting... until I realised that I could just review a subset of the books I've read. I chose to focus on YA, since I think it's a genre that gets a bad rap, when many of the books I've read feature smart, determined and emotionally mature characters, hugely diverse casts, and commentary on a wide range of social and political issues. Some YA is admittedly terrible, but much of it has a lot to say about the world, as well as being fun, easy reading. 

For those interested, my bingo cards to date (including adult books) are [here](https://imgur.com/M9RD9HA) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/LNqwl3E). These reviews include some books that didn't make my bingo card as I've read more books than available squares.

[**The Legacy of Orisha trilogy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34728667-children-of-blood-and-bone) by Toni Adeyemi

*Magic is banned in the west African-inspired land of Orïsha and maji continue to be hunted and killed. Zélie, accompanied by a rogue princess, finds herself on the run from the crown prince and on a mission to bring magic back to the kingdom.* 

Bingo squares: Afrofuturism, ownvoices, published in 2019 (book #2), four word title 

Review: 4/5. I really enjoyed this series, and loved both Zélie and Amari’s POVs - both characters are smart, determined and able to stick up for themselves and what they believe to be right. The book draws a number of parallels to modern day racism and experiences of violence among black people which I think is important in YA fantasy (though I have seen some criticism of her portrayal of Nigerian culture, and am happy to hear more on these points from others). 


[**Six of Crows**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows) by Leigh Bardugo

*Criminal mastermind Kaz Brekker and his team of misfits set off on the heist of a lifetime. Their success is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction—if they don’t kill each other first.* 

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode)

Rating: 5/5. My rating is probably no surprise given the hype around this book, but I love the amount of care that Bardugo affords to all her characters (even when they break your heart), the dialogue is hilarious, and the heist is so intricately plotted that I gasped every time Kaz pulled off another trick.   


[**The Folk of the Air series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince) by Holly Black

*Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King. To win a place at the Court, she must defy him – and face the consequences.*

Bingo squares: Twins (extra hard mode), published in 2019 (books #2-3)

Review: 3/5. This series is hugely popular in YA circles, but I found it to be pretty average. The (big) saving grace is Jude, who is selfish, politically motivated and ruthless, all traits we typically don’t get to see in YA characters, particularly young women. 


[**The Diviners Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7728889-the-diviners) by Libba Bray

*In 1920s New York City, a group of teenagers with mysterious supernatural abilities band together to fight the ghosts that are terrorising the city.*

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode, books #2-3), four word title (books #2-3)

Review: 4/5. There's a lot going on in these books (each instalment could easily be 100 pages shorter), but they're so much fun. Bray captures both the spookiness of the paranormal and the optimism and excess of the roaring 20s perfectly, as well as tackling issues such racism, poverty and workers' rights. The final book will be released in February 2020 for anyone wary of picking up a new series. 


[**House of Salt and Sorrows**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39679076-house-of-salt-and-sorrows) by Erin A Craig 

*A retelling of* Twelve Dancing Princesses*, set in a manor by the sea... only four of the sisters have died in tragic circumstances, and it’s possible their deaths were no accident.* 

Bingo squares: Retelling (hard mode), ocean setting, published in 2019, four word title 

Review: 2/5. This book was incredibly atmospheric, but unfortunately all of the characters (including the MC) were bland as white bread, the villains were lame and the plot was full of convenient deus ex machinas. 


[**Aurora Rising**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40932278-aurora-rising) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff

*Recently graduated from the Aurora Academy, a group of new cadets set out on their first intergalactic mission, only to find themselves in the middle of a brewing civil war.*

Bingo squares: Twins (hard mode), Aussie author, AI character, published in 2019

Review: 5/5. This was honestly just an unapologetically fun space romp and I loved everyone on this ship. 


[**The Illuminae Files**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23395680-illuminae) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff

*Kady and Ezra broke up the same day their planet was invaded. Trapped on an evacuation ship with an enemy fleet bearing down and an AI system that may or may not be out to get them, they’re now forced to work together to save their people and uncover the truth behind the invasion.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, AI character (hard mode)

Rating: 3/5 (noting I’ve only read the first book in the series). The main attraction of this book is the way it’s written - told entirely through documents including emails, chat logs and transcripts - and unfortunately I didn’t think the format was enough to make up for a pretty average plot (if anything, it made it worse, because I felt so disconnected from the main characters). However, if you love unique storytelling formats, you’ll probably love this one. 


[**The Cursebreakers Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43204703-a-curse-so-dark-and-lonely) by Brigid Kemmerer

*A* Beauty and the Beast *retelling where the main character finds herself transported from Washington DC to the kingdom of Emberfell, where the Prince is trapped by a curse that will only be lifted once he finds true love.*

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode), retelling (hard mode), published in 2019, four word title 

Review: 4/5. I was expecting a pretty generic retelling, but the plot quickly goes in a unique direction, led by the main character Harper who quickly makes it her mission not just to save the Prince of Emberfall, but also its people. Harper also has cerebral palsy and I really appreciated the disability rep in this book. 


[**The Lifelike Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29456569-lifel1k3) by Jay Kristoff 

*Set in a post-apocalyptic USA during a robot rebellion, Evie and Lemon find a ruined android in a scrap heap, who helps uncover the truth behind the revolt.* 

Bingo squares: Aussie author, AI character (hard mode), published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 4/5. This series was pitched by the author as “Romeo and Juliet meets Mad Max”, and it’s honestly as ridiculous as it sounds, making it an easy, fun read. 


[**The Lunar Chronicles**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36381037-cinder) by Marissa Meyer

*A sci-fi retelling of four fairytales, starting with the story of Cinder, a cyborg girl in New Beijing who is forced to fend for herself by her awful stepmother, bringing her directly into the path of Prince Kai and setting in motion an intergalactic war.* 

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (hard mode), retelling (hard mode), AI character (hard mode)

Review: 4/5. Honestly, these books are just plain fun, particularly as the characters of each retelling get drawn into the broader plot. My only complaint is that balancing the four (all het) couples at the centre of each fairytale can become a drag at times.  


[**The Old Kingdom Series**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518848.Sabriel) by Garth Nix

*In the Old Kingdom, the Abhorsen helps maintain the border between life and death, righting the wrongs caused by necromancers who interfere with the dead. When Sabriel’s father, the current Abhorsen, goes missing, Sabriel sets out to find him and confront her own destiny. 

Bingo squares: Aussie author 

Review: 4/5. Lots has been said about how good this series is already on this sub, but these books definitely have the most well-thought out and interesting take on necromancy I’ve seen. 


[**Angel Mage**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43655625-angel-mage) by Garth Nix

*A Three Musketeers inspired fantasy set in an analogue of 17th century France, in which angels can be summoned to help with all kinds of tasks and four new friends must team up against a powerful mage with a devastating ability to control the angels for her own ends.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, published in 2019 

Review: 3/5. I loved the world-building and how subtly progressive this book is (there are several female characters in positions of power and lots of PoC living in what is essentially medieval Europe), but was highly disappointed by the abruptness of the ending. Routinely tagged as a YA book (with most of the main characters in their late teens/early 20s), but definitely one that I think is equally aimed at an adult audience. 


[**Whisper**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34020950-whisper) by Lynette Noni

*Following a devastating incident, 'Jane Doe' has been locked away in a secret research facility under Sydney for over two years, without uttering a single word. Once she finally finds her voice, she's exposed to a world of magic which the government has been trying hard to keep a secret.* 

Bingo squares: Aussie author (hard mode), published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 3/5. The main character was lacking in personality and the love triangle was unnecessary (when isn't it?) but the magic system based on the power of words and speech was pretty cool.


[**The Secret Commonwealth**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19034943-the-secret-commonwealth) by Philip Pullman

*Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, are forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed.*

Bingo squares: Published in 2019

Rating: 5/5. I first read *His Dark Materials* at age 11 and fell in love with Lyra Silvertongue, so honestly this rating is gonna be biased and you should just read the series if you haven’t already. 


[**Wayward Son**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44034303-wayward-son) by Rainbow Rowell

*Simon Snow did everything he was supposed to do. He beat the villain. He won the war. He even fell in love. Now comes the good part, right? Now comes the happily ever after…*

Bingo squares: Vampires (hard mode), published in 2019. 

Review: 2/5. I loved *Carry On* and really appreciated all the subtle nods to those of us who grew up obsessed with reading and writing HP fanfiction. However, this book felt like a let down - while I love the premise that being the Chosen One comes with a lot of mental trauma to process afterwards, the actual execution of that idea felt a lot like torture porn, with hour upon hour of watching the characters suffering in silence and failing to communicate.


[**Skyward**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward) by Brandon Sanderson

*The remnants of the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot and avenge her father’s reputation.* 

*Bingo squares*: AI character, published in 2019 (book #2)

Review: 4/5. You can't really go wrong with Sanderson. Well-plotted (if perhaps a bit formulaic at times), an engaging main character and an interesting take on the idea of living up to the reputation of one's father.


[**Four Dead Queens**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40367270-four-dead-queens) by Astrid Scholte

*Keralie Corrington is one of Quadara’s most cunning thieves, but her latest job finds her entangled in a conspiracy that has left all four of Quadara’s queens for dead, with time running out to solve the mystery.*

Bingo squares: Aussie author, published in 2019 (hard mode)

Review: 2/5. The world-building was an absolute mess and I kept being too distracted by it to really enjoy the story. Also features an unfortunate case of ‘bury your gays’, and some of the significant moral and ethical implications of various plot points are never really discussed or explored. 


[**The Guinevere Deception**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43568394-the-guinevere-deception) by Kiersten White

*A retelling of Athurian legend where Guinevere is actually a witch sent to protect Arthur from the dangers lurking in Camelot.*

Bingo squares: Retelling, published in 2019

Review: 3.5/5. The pacing of this book was quite uneven at times but it was a fun and refreshing take on the original legends, and I really appreciated its focus on Guinevere, who is so often either mistreated or ignored in Arthurian stories.",1

Specifically right now I'm thinking about what to get my niece who is 6, but I'll bookmark anything interesting and fantasy related and get it for some little kid someday. 

If anyone's lurking in a similar boat- I really like Munchkin, which is a really simple fantasy card game, and have given it a few times and little folk seem to like it.",1
852,"The Gotrek and Felix novels are really good, above what one would expect from game tie-in novels.I recently finished the 5th Gotrek and Felix novel, *Beastslayer.* I was so impressed. Some caveats: they are somewhat male-centered. There is only one female main character, Ulrika, although she is a bad ass. And occasionally Gotrek and Felix give off a “buddy cop film” vibe. But, I dare say these novels are not superficial in surprising ways and really explore some compelling existentialist themes, such as fighting on in the face of despair, staying true to friends and one’s word, and the complexity and messiness of relationships (romantic and platonic). What do you think of these novels? I also should say that I do not play Warhammer the miniatures game. I came to these novels because they continuously came up in conversations with my fantasy-loving friends. Last comment: the worldbuilding in these novels is so vivid.",1
853,"Terry Pratchett, The Bromeliad.Anyone read this? Any ideas if it fits any of this years bingo squares? It’s been sat on my to read shelf for a couple of years, which is shameful as I have read every book by Terry but not this one for some reason. 

I only have a couple of squares left (Small Scale/Slice of Life, Twins and Afrofuturism I think) but perfectly happy to reorder my selections. Just about to start listening to Greater Boston for Slice of Life, for some reason it’s the square that’s given me the most difficulty in selecting.",1
854,"Does Anyone Else Struggle to Visualize?So, I really struggle to visualize things when reading a book. I don't have Aphantasia, I can get a pretty decent image in my head, but it's usually wonky and not how I want it to look. I particularly struggle with human proportions and faces and the size of things in general. When I try to visualize a character they usually end up as an extreme version of how they're described (i.e. if someone is described as being thin then I imagine them with incredibly unrealistic proportions to the point where they almost look as thin as a stick figure). It's really annoying and it's almost like fighting a battle with my own head because people never turn out how I want them to look. Does anyone else struggle with this? Does anyone know how to get better at imagining exactly what you think it should look like?",1
855,"My finished bingo card - mostly magic, and some other stuffI'm done with my first bingo card ever! I enjoyed filling out the spaces on my card, and to celebrate, I'm posting short musings and some stats. 

* Average score: 3.75 (not bad!)
* Female to male authors: 17:10
* Self-published works that stayed that way: 2
* Stand-alone books: 8
* The prevailing theme - magic, featured in 16 books

SLICE OF LIFE: **Stevermer, Caroline -** [**A Scholar of Magics**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1041257.A_Scholar_of_Magics?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=zondajoNHP&amp;rank=1) 

*  In the second installment of the series A College of Magics, we visit yet another magic school, this time for men only, in England. Everything is very proper and cerebral, right before it goes into silly direction of a notorious conspiracy. *(4/5)*  
  

CHARACTER WITH DISABILTY: **Josiah Bancroft -** [**Arm of the Sphinx**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959733-arm-of-the-sphinx?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=5NXUT27H99&amp;rank=1)

* After losing one's wife, naivete, and self-absorption, Senlin found himself a crew, and hallucinations. How are they to find Marya and navigate the Tower, where factions prepare for battle?   
 Since Gormenghast I wasn't so enamored in a fictional place. The characters are no less interesting, with more of them coming to the forefront. Multiple POVs are handled quite well, as well as multiple plot-threads. *(5/5)*

SFF NOVELA: **Kelly Robson -** [**Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36187158-gods-monsters-and-the-lucky-peach?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=pjd1AJ1Sy4&amp;rank=1)

* The world became unlivable as climate changed (are you scared yet?). However, there are is a push for ecological restoration - and one of the ways to do that is time-travel. Of course, meeting the locals is not without its problems...   
 This book doesn't pull its punches, and it ain't pretty. You are bombarded with techno-babble, trying to make sense of the world's history and who's who, and when you finally grasp it, you get punched in the gut. It's a miracle how many emotions a work under 200 pages can invoke. I'm mostly angry, though. The characters behave so human it's almost painful*. (4/5)*

SELF-PUBLISHED SSF: **Patrick, Benedict -** [**Those Brave, Foolish Souls from the City of Swords**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35895961-those-brave-foolish-souls-from-the-city-of-swords?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=mLheSxplr0&amp;rank=1)

* Benedict Patrick continues to tick my boxes for enjoyable, meaningful stories filled with characters I care about. Here, we see echoes of America's fables, and get to meet some parallel-universe version of Pocahontas.   
 We follow 3 POVs and - I'm not gonna lie - together with the stories between chapters, it sometimes felt like a chore. I feel that characters' stories (especially Yizel's), as result, rang a bit hollow, their motivations not that clear, their emotions a bit harder to experience.  *(4/5)*

SFF TWINS: **Seth Dickinson -** [**The Traitor Baru Cormorant**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=LvRyu8JGSO&amp;rank=1) 

* Her home colonized, Baru is set on gaining enough power to turn tables on the conquerors. Alas, doing so will test her beyond endurance, as she is to be used as a weapon herself.  
 Baru is a compelling, if unlikable, character. She has to make hard decisions. The impact was somewhat dulled because the abundance of characters made it almost impossible to get to know them enough to care for them*. (3.5/5)*

VAMPIRES: **Frohock, T. -** [**Los Nefilim**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26029556-los-nefilim?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=JZylKoV1Oj&amp;rank=1)

* Nefilim are children of humans and angels, or human and demons, or both. Their magic rises from the use of music, and concerning their parentage, they have some unique abilities. Diago is both demonic and angelic in nature, which makes him a pawn in angelic and demonic power struggles. The characters are vivid and likable, the plot tight and unforgiving*,* and the magic system interesting.  *(4/5)*  

GRAPHIC NOVEL: **Marjorie M.Liu, Sana Takeda - Monstress Vol.3:Haven** 

* The art is still great and the stakes ever higher. What *is* it with the parasitical monster? I am still a bit lost in many threads and factions (I can't be bothered to write it down), but enjoying the ride. *(4/5)*

OCEAN SETTING: **McKillip, Patricia A. -** [**The Changeling Sea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59.The_Changeling_Sea?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=g8sfPU5AYx&amp;rank=1)

* Peri's father has perished on the sea, and her mother sits by the window, depressed and bewitched by the sea. Peri hexes the sea, and out comes the sea-dragon, and the magic, and the restless prince.   
 This book feels warm, and familiar. The characters are well rounded and kind, the magic fickle and strange, and the atmosphere hopeful. I enjoyed Peri's friends at the inn, the romance, and the conclusion to the story*. (5/5)*

CYBERPUNK: **Melissa Scott -** [**Trouble and Her Friends**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/612226.Trouble_and_Her_Friends?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=beWWUBZoeJ&amp;rank=1)

* The crackers' time is at an end - the Law has come to the Net, and Trouble skips town and her lover. But one does not leave that easily, and three years later Treasury is on her back, there is an impostor that took her name, and there is nothing she can do but to go back.   
 This was a refreshing take on cyberpunk tropes - if still a bit dry, and full of technobabble I abhor. The characterization was good, the world-building solid, and I came to care what happens to Trouble (and her friends, naturally). On the other hand, the plot dragged in the middle, and some interesting plot moments were picked up and immediately dropped (I'd like to know more about secretary schools, thank you very much). *(2.5/5)*

2ND CHANCE: **Aliette de Bodard -** [**The Tea Master and the Detective** ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36686547-the-tea-master-and-the-detective?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=gZQ0HPUcyO&amp;rank=1)

* Sherlock in space? Not really, but nevertheless it was an engaging read I almost completely forgot in a week. *(3 /5)*

AFROFUTURISM: **Nnedi Okorafor -** [**Binti**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25667918-binti?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=WIgpFtVJ5F&amp;rank=1) 

* Binti is leaving her home world to start new education, but in the middle of their flight everyone but her is murdered. She is alone, left to parley and negotiate with the murderers.   
 This is a short, atmospheric work that happens mostly inside Binti's head. The conflict is convincing and the problem solving quite unique, if a bit dry. *(3.5/5)*

PUBLISHED 2019: **Arden, Katherine -** [**The Winter of the Witch**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36621586-the-winter-of-the-witch?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=lDZDxm8qVE&amp;rank=1) 

* The ending of a trilogy that made me feel, wonder, and sigh. Vasya is all grown up and eager to make her own name in a world that is struggling to decide between two religions, and two masters... The war is brewing in Rus.   
 This story is very satisfying in its approach to characterization, setting, and imagining of historical events. This is probably the first time I enjoyed Slavic folklore from the pen of a contemporary ""Western"" author. I enjoyed the book, although it lacked a certain \*something\* to be a stellar read. *(4/5)*

LOCAL: **Dubravka Ugrešić -** [**Baba Jaga je snijela jaje**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6437644-baba-jaga-je-snijela-jaje?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=rqdJdEl9oc&amp;rank=1) **(Baba Yaga Laid an Egg)**

* A curious triptich loosely based on Baba Jaga concept(s). For the most part, this book read like a pantomime in my mind - it was nonsensical, and witty. The fear of the old age is present in most of the narrative, intertwined with hope and joie de vivre. Some of the elements didn't work for me, and the satire took of some of the enjoyment from it. The characters really felt like dolls (maybe it's intentional, but I didn't care for it either way), and imagery was in-your-face. *(2.5/5)*

MIDDLE GRADE: **Cooper, Susan -** [**Over Sea, Under Stone**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11312.Over_Sea_Under_Stone?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=23kdja62Af&amp;rank=1) 

* The Drew children find a map, and with small help fromtheir eccentric uncle start looking for Arthurian treasure, trying to stay ahead of curious enemies.   
 This book was cozy and familiar, but forgettable and boring. *(2/5)*

PERSONAL RECCOMENDATION [R/FANTASY](/r/FANTASY): **Sarah Gailey -** [**Magic for Liars**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34594037-magic-for-liars?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=CayIDn1JQB&amp;rank=1)

* Ivy Gamble is hired to solve a murder (or is it?) case in a magic school, where she is forced to come to terms with her estranged twin dister and her own sense of failure.   
 This is a tight-paced, character-based book, where you guess the killer almost immediately and are mad at inept PI who is struggling with her own shit. *(3/5)*

BOOK OF THE MONTH/READALONG: **Marina and Sergey Dyachenko -** [**Vita Nostra**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=XVtH4AFpHd&amp;rank=1)

* Sasha is forced to study incomprehensible things - things that change her very essence.   
 This read like a study in metaphysics, an uncomfortable and often violent coming-of-age story. The book was almost impossible to put down, and will stay with me for a long time. *(5/5)*

MEDIA TIE-IN: **Brandon Sanderson -** [**Children of the Nameless**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43205859-children-of-the-nameless?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=d0LKMyxInR&amp;rank=1)

*  Innistrad is a land where one tries to live while demons and monsters populate the forests, and mystical Entities influence the land and one's people. When a village is wiped out, a cursed girl wants to get her vengeance on powerful Man of the Manor.   
 I've played Magic ages ago, but the knowledge about it wasn't needed - Sanderson is really a master of world-building. The world is indeed interesting, both bleak and hopeful. Tropes are abundant and the twist quite unsurprising, but this was a nice, cozy book around 200 pages. I found the characterization to be weak - I never really remember or care about Sanderson's characters, really. *(3/5)*

AI CHARACTER: **C. Robert Cargill -** [**Sea of Rust**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32617610-sea-of-rust?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=dO0UgDFsDD&amp;rank=1)

*  AI uprising is finished, leaving the world bereft of humans and animals alike. And of hope, it seems, because it's every bot for itself.   
 I enjoyed the action scenes here, it really read more like a movie. It was really cool and something my teenage students would enjoy. Alas, the characterization was not on par, and it felt emotionally stunted - and not in an ""AI"" way. Still, I enjoyed the imagery and it was refreshing to read an AI's dystopia, so I'm rounding it up to *(4/5)*

4 OR MORE WORDS: **Diana Wynne Jones -** [**Dark Lord of Derkholm**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47587.Dark_Lord_of_Derkholm?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=zGMU0QqXMf&amp;rank=1)

*  How does one go around and becomes a Dark Lord when one is expected to do so to be a tourist attraction? That is the situation wizard Derk finds himself in, together with his numerous household that includes his human and griffin children, as well as various wondrous Animals (who doesn't like flying pigs or carnivorous sheep?).   
 I enjoyed this satire: while humorous, it didn't shy away from more serious themes of dehumanization, cruelty, manipulation, or serious consequences. The book sagged a bit in the middle, though, and some of the themes were not as thoroughly discussed as I'd have liked. *(4/5)*

RETELLING: **Drew Heyes -** [**Second Hand Curses**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36315727-second-hand-curses?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=5B5F0Cf1C5&amp;rank=1) 

* A band of likeable and not-as-they-seem rascals romps through (some kind of) fairyland, solving problems for gold. We get to revisit some old-time favorites with a morbid twist (Cinderella, Pinocchio, Pied Piper of Hamelin, etc.), and see how our rascals chase afteir their salvation...  
 This book was so fun! Certainly, it could use an editor to weed out a chunk of text, and some more characterization... but it is entertaining, has some good action scenes, and ruins your childhood. What's not to like? *(4/5)*

AUSTRALIAN: **O'Malley, Daniel -** [**The Rook**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836728-the-rook?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=hPryvRyHaB&amp;rank=1)

* A woman comes to her senses in the rain, in the midst of dead bodies. What next?   
 This book was a struggle to get into, to be honest. It also has a weird case of man-gaze. It started strong, and then dragged about 100 pages, with much info dumps, and little in the way of plot.  When it gained momentum it was a fun ride to the end. A secret government organization that deals with supernatural phenomenon was never so witty! *(3.5/5)*

FINAL BOOK IN A SERIES: **Ian Tregillis -** [**Necessary Evil**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793041-necessary-evil?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=aZ6TYAhDNq&amp;rank=4)

* **Milkweed Triptych** became one of my favorite series. This unique blend of plotting, characterization, and alternate history with German Übermensch and British Elder wizards has my favorite villain of all time – precog Gretel. The final installment bring everything to an end in a mostly satisfying manner, even if the MC was my least favorite character, fuckin' Marsh. (*5/5* for the series, *4/5* for this book)

\#OWNVOICES: **N.K.Jemisin -** [**Broken Earth trilogy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=ASEaLMGpj3&amp;rank=1)

* One of the most disappointing series – came highly recommended, started strong, and then lost my interest with constant repetition of themes, meandering, and over-the-top, and shove-it-in-your-face explanations. A shame. *(3.5/5)* 

LitRPG: **Andrew Rowe -** [**Sufficiently Advanced Magic**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403860-sufficiently-advanced-magic?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=2hCwbQdJ2E&amp;rank=1)

*  In a world where peace hangs in precarious balance, there be towers in which a Godess grants powers (or attunements) in exchange for solving the tower's mysteries and slaying its monsters. It is a thing of prestige, but Corin just wants his brother back. The book has a magic school (yay!), solid and game-like magic system (all the info-dumps one could possibly want!), a protagonist that is all about alliances (no social skills but no excuses!), and hints about a broader world. Sure, there could be less exposition, the world-building could be better, the characters more fleshed out, and the sense of danger more prominent, but this has been a really fun ride, and the ending packed a great twist. *(4/5)*

FIVE SHORT STORIES: **Nalo Hopkinson -** [**Falling In Love With Hominids**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23846151-falling-in-love-with-hominids?from_search=true&amp;qid=QzNpkGTtv3&amp;rank=7)

*  This anthology contains stories with short introductions from the author, and all of them are a part of the process in which the author ""fell in love with humans"" of whom she despaired in her youth. It is a curious and intriguing mix of fables and concepts mostly set in our world, some in our time, some in future. There is horror, there are emotions, there is weirdness, and there is wonder. Important topics are introduced and explored, as well as that interpersonal traumas. Some of the stories worked better than others. *(4/5)*",1

857,"I need some new (by which I mean recently emerged) favorite authors.Just realized that all of my favorite authors are either writers of decades-long standing... or dead. I dont think I've added a new author to my favorites list for at least a decade. I don't have a bookstore nearby to browse in and my little local library has a small fantasy section, so I buy books online mostly. I would really love some suggestions for new authors to check out. Looking for 

1. Authors who debuted in the last decade-ish 

2. Write books that are not epics. Please.

3. No excessive gore, sex, language (some of all is fine)

4. Authors who have at least a handful of books I can read.

I'm not fond of first person perspective and most but not all of my favorite authors are women. (My bookshelf has Mercedes Lackey, Robin McKinley, Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, Jane Yolen, Patricia C Wrede, Robert Jordan, Tolkien, Asimov, Patricia McKillip,  Terry Pratchett, for reference.)

859,"Seeking Ideas and Recommendations for an Audiodrama-only r/fantasy Bingo CardInspired by u/tctippens’ recommendations for Bingo, and u/briargrey’s reviews, I’m working on an all-audiodrama bingo card. (Thank you both for making me think this was possible!) I've got most of it sorted, but I’m struggling to figure out a few squares, and hoping people here have some ideas. 

I'm looking for recommendations, and in some cases ideas for how to interpret the square, for:

**LitRPG**: Are there any litRPG audio dramas? If not, I might try an actual play podcast, since it seems close to the spirit of the square -- any recommendations for someone who has never listened to one and isn’t sure if they’ll like it?

**Retelling**

**Anthology/short stories**: Hoping to find an audio drama option, not just narrated short stories.

**Graphic Novel/Audiobook**: Currently just using this as an “over 25 hours” square, but if anyone has ideas more aligned with the format switch of the square, I’ll take them!

**Self-published**: What would the equivalent be for podcasts? Any specific ones you'd recommend?

(**Book Club/Readalong**: I’ll probably swap this for a “reviewed on r/fantasy” category, since I don’t think this has ever happened.)

**Personal Recommendation**: **Let me know your favorite audiodramas that I should try**! I'm relatively new to these, so there's lots I haven't listened to, particularly outside of the really commonly mentioned ones like Nightvale, Bright Sessions, and We're Alive. I’ll try most things, though I tend to stay away from horror (mildly creepy is fine). Some of my favorites have been Love and Luck, Wolf 359, Steal the Stars, and the second season of Kalila Stormfire (the first season was good, but not quite my thing--I think maybe I prefer larger casts of characters to follow). I usually prefer stories that are optimistic or hopeful, even if their world is dark, and likable main characters are a big plus. Open to any length or genre, completed stories or not. Also, it seems less common in audiodramas than books, but I'd appreciate a heads up if you know that a show has onscreen sexual or domestic violence—it doesn’t mean I won’t listen to it, just that I’ll select when I listen more carefully (e.g. maybe not when I want to decompress from a stressful day at work...).

862,"[SPOILERS] Just Finished A Land Fit for Heroes (The Steel Remains, The Cold Commands, The Dark Defiles) by Richard K MorganI've had my eye on this series for a long time (since i read First Law 10 years ago).   Finally picked up all 3 books.   I found it pretty ... alright.

I think it checks off a lot of boxes.   I like the grim darkness and violence of it.  The High Tech vs High Magic aspects.

The last book was such a slog.   Just wanted to get it over with.   I liked the trilogy, but i don't think i would have regretted not reading it at all.

At least it taught me a little of what i DON'T like:

* same bad guy(s)/threat level  the entire trilogy.   i know some series get criticized cause of the way they exponentially ramp up the bad guys through the series like Dragonball.    but thats better than having the same enemy that we see defeated over and over again.
* The hero just keeps whipping their ass at the end of each book.  And each time the hero does it with the intervention of ...  literal Deus Ex.  Like in-universe Gods. Every time.
* i like description and details, but this book's overly descriptive passages about the angle of a credenza...or whatever ... i kept just skimming over them, and did that thing where i felt guilty about skimming over text, and going back to read the passages, and then wishing i skipped them
* the magic in the world is ... so convenient.   Every time the hero gets into a bind.  theres a convenient spell that he pulls out of thin air that seems to be tailor made for the situation.   and then we read a flashback of him learning that spell.
* also i counted at least 6 x where the hero gets captured, or defeated or bushwacked, and then is tied up and surrounded and outnumbered.   and the bad guy explains the entire plan, and then turns their back on the hero.  and then of course the hero inevitably gets the upper hand or gets saved by a deus ex.   2x in the last 100 pages.
* off page death for a main character!   like end a cliffhanger on one chapter where one of the main heroes is in a situation where, surely he must be dead, but lets find out how he gets out of it!!!,  then 3 chapters later,   ""he ded""
* set up interesting dynamic between old and new religions, but didnt seem to explore it much.
* set up interesting world history /mysteries and didnt really explore it much

&amp;#x200B;

what i did like:

* kiriath Steel
* the muhn/band
* near the last 50 pages or so when the hero is recaptured again and the bad guy is gloating  ""your story is almost at an end, can you feel how thin the pages left are?""   very meta
* i also like the ... internal monologue type parts (in italic).  They seem to happen in ""real time"" and other characters will catch the main pov characters ""zoning out""
* i think cthulhu makes a cameo.

&amp;#x200B;

i think i like my magic at a minimum, less convenient.",1
863,"Looking to decompress, help by recommending some laidback romance booksAfter reading a few stressful high intrigue books I want to just unwind a bit a read a story where the main character meets someone special, maybe they have a few adventures together, and they live happily ever after.

864,"Review of Lovecraft Country - 3/5Just finished this last night and ended up writing a rare review.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This was really hard to rate. 3 or 4 stars? I kept changing my mind. Eventually I decided - helped along by reading other reviews - that I only wanted to give it 4 stars because I really like the concept, because I want to see more of this kind of thing, and because the beginning of the book was great and stuck the most in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, the book slightly disappointed me, given its acclaim. It IS a good book, but it has very little Lovecraft connection beyond the first story (&gt;!ghosts and killer dolls and rather garden variety wizardry!&lt; are not really Lovecraftian), it's rhythm and flow is all over the place, and it is pretty thinly drawn both in terms of detail, characters, and often prose (but that might just be my own personal preference).

&amp;#x200B;

Finding out the book is more like a collection of connected short stories (none of which conclude in their part, and all have to wait for the bull rush of an ending at the final end of the book) was my biggest gripe, especially after such an excellent, engaging and atmospheric setup in the first and longest (and by far most Lovecraftian) story and me wondering where it was gonna lead to. Then each story gets a little more disappointing and disconnected and you realise it's more like you're reading loosely tied together vignettes, without a particularly engaging overarching plot. It feels very front loaded.

&amp;#x200B;

The end felt like the author had gotten a bit bored of it all and just wanted to hurry up and finish it. What I kept (with exciting foreboding) expecting to happen in regards to the wider plot and its possible terrible revelations never actually happened, and it turned out there was very little to the plot after all. Maybe the author wanted it all quickly tied up and was more concerned with the side-themes than the plot or its lasting impact on the characters. That's not Lovecraftian - but then neither is this book.

&amp;#x200B;

The book is still a good book, and people will (and do) obviously rate it a lot higher, and that's totally fair. In my opinion it succeeds most when it is dealing with Jim Crow America, when it is ""on the move"" (as in the first story), and anything to do with the Safe Negro Travel Guide or Ardham. All of that was great. It succeeds least when it is trying to be scary after the first story, when it is simply throwing things at the wall to see what sticks (and not giving things time to land and their impact digested), when it gets really light and pulpy, when it is comes to making a really compelling overall narrative, and when it is forgetting to engage in deeper characterisation or meaningful consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps most jarring of all is how all the characters take the existence of &gt;!magic, monsters, ghosts, other worlds!&lt; etc. completely in their stride, like it was all barely above the mundane. Certainly don't expect any ""driven to madness"" that's such a central theme to Lovecraftian works. In fact don't expect much more than a raised eyebrow.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a good, pulpy read, but unfortunately I was hoping for a lot more than that given the hype and acclaim. I was also hoping for a deep and engaging Lovecraftian deconstruction - but after the first story he was more of just a mild reference than anything, and I think the great title of the book looked in hindsight like a little bit of a selling gimmick.",1

868,"Sorcerer's Legacy - a quick reviewJust finished this book for the first time last night, and it was a really engrossing read. The plot grabs you right from the start and the pace is refreshingly fast and relentless. I was a bit worried seeing as how one of the primary subgenres is romance, as honestly romance typically isn't my thing and often struggles to hold my attention, but the gripping court and political intrigue took center stage, the romance when it did show up I felt was really well done, and there's quite a fair bit of action as well - more than I was suspecting, which really surprised me but in a good way!

In short, it was a wonderful read. If I had any complaints, it would be that everything seems to wrap up a bit too quickly and neatly at the end, and there didn't really feel like there was much in the way of traditional denouement, but other than that it was a really good, gripping, and enjoyable read, and an excellent debut by Janny Wurts.",1

870,"Relation between Morrowind and MistbornI played Morrowind a few years ago from the Elder Scrolls series, and I started reading Mistborn the other day. I couldn't help but notice a lot of similarities between the two universes and I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this. Some of the similarities I found were:
-Whole country covered in ash after disaster from years ago caused by a living god defeating a mysterious  enemy.
-Red sky and sun after said disaster.
-Society divided into great houses that dominate society. Granted, there are more noble houses in Mistborn than there are in Morrowind, but the dynamic is similar.
-Said houses have large buildings in capital city. Keeps in Luthadel and cantons in Vivec city.
-Rulership by great houses controlled by theocracy led by a living deity. Vivec in Morrowind, Lord ruler in Mistborn.
-Society relies heavily on near slavery and is racist towards said slaves. The skaa in Mistborn and the argonians in Morrowind.
-Plantations worked by slaves in the rural areas of the country.
-Plants have all turned an ugly colour.
-Skaa sounds like Skaal even though the have nothing to do with each other

Those are some of the similarities I found, don't know how many people on this sub have played/read both series. Looking forward to any answers!",1
871,"When Cage Matches Replace Lawyers and Wars: A Review of The Combat Codes by Alexander DarwinStarting off I have a few disclaimers. First and foremost, this is my first review so please bear with me if it sucks. Second, I did win a giveaway in order to receive the audiobook for free. I had actually bought the e-book before and had decided to buy the audiobook once my credits reset on audible, so I declined the free book.

My thoughts:

I loved reading the book, and can't wait for the sequel here in a few months! I read it in about two days, while visiting the in-laws. The book is written by a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner and instructor, thus the fights are realistic. That was the draw for me to read the book, and it delivered! All of the fights were satisfying in one way or another. it was a great time. The story is a pretty solid story, but I don't want to talk much on my thoughts as I don't trust myself to not spoil anything. I just truly had a great great time, and still a few weeks later find myself thinking on things from the book.

Synopsis by me: This is a book about fighting. The book is set in the future, where war got so bad that collectively everyone decided to settle all disputes in one-on-one unarmed combat matches. The fighters, called Grievars, follow a set of codes, the titular Combat Codes. A young boy, Cego, is fighting in the underground, and is discovered by a retired Grievar, Murray, who is now a talent scout. Murray fights to free Cego and bring him to the institute to train. The rest of the book follows the events unfolding there.

The world is quite futuristic. I found it to be a neat mix of the worlds of Hunger Games, Red Rising, and Into the Badlands. I wouldn't call it a YA book by any means, but it did have a somewhat YA feel, likely due to the similar vibes I was getting to the books/show mentioned previously. It was close enough to our technology to be a believable future for the world, but not so close that it felt strange to read about. The feel of the world is usually one of the first things to break a book for me, so the fact that I like the world, and I am interested in exploring it some is a great feeling. I enjoy the concept of not fighting with technology and guns even though it is an option, and settling things with a brutal unarmed fight instead. That is part of the charm of kung-fu films. 

The prose is somewhat simple, which in my opinion really helped pull me into the story. It is told from the perspective of some fighters, not intellectuals. As such, it feels like you experience the world as they do. They think differently than I do as a numbers guy, and as such the book feels more whole to me. A thread was posted a while back about not giving easy to read books enough credit. I feel like this falls into that category, it is easy to read, but it is strength not a flaw.

In fantasy, often fights go on for what feels like forever, or they just do outrageous things that would never work in real life. This is something that any lover of fights will notice, and sometimes it is enough to make you want to put down the book. I noticed at times the fights in this book relied on terminology that I wasn't very familiar with, or just felt too technical, but it never felt unrealistic. I still loved pretty much every minute of every fight. My goodness it is satisfying to read a good fight, and imagine it happening. The fights as they played out in my head were spectacular! Part of that is my imagination running wild, part of that is just having a well written fight.

Every book has its flaws. This is the first book written by Darwin, writing about one of his favorite things (BJJ). As such I expect some flaws to creep in and be overlooked for one reason or another. However, no flaw I noticed was so big, or so bad that it pulled me out of reading. None of them will keep me from buying the sequel, and I can only expect that Darwin will get better as he writes more, and if he doesn't I am still more than happy and satisfied with what he will produce based off this book.

My biggest gripe about the book is really that it made me miss my time practicing martial arts. I just don't have the options that I really want where I live anymore (too small of a place), and likely won't anytime too soon. I guess I'll just have to live vicariously through the sequel!

TLDR; I loved this book. It has its flaws as all books do, but with this being a debut novel, I am beyond pleased. If you like good fights, or UFC, this book is definitely for you. It is an easy read, and fairly quick, with a sequel on the way soon. You won't regret the read!

881,"Dreadnought by April Daniels - Trans Supergirl fantasy story 4.5/5http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1459-dreadnought

4.5/5

DREADNOUGHT is the first novel of the Nemesis series. The premise is Danny Tozer, young transgender girl, is there when Dreadnought the world's greatest superhero is killed. Danny inherits the power of Dreadnought but also becomes her idealized self (effectively Supergirl). This is problematic since Danny is still hiding her trans identity from her transphobic parents as well as schoolmates. She is, after all, only fifteen. But there's more to her life than dealing with them. There's an entire army of evil she needs to defeat as the other superheroes have nothing on Dreadnought--and the world needs a Dreadnought.

I really liked this book and have to say that April Daniels did an excellent story of superheroics and a Spiderman ""coming of age"" origin while also telling a tale of a trans teen coming to terms with their new identity. Danielle is completely aware of who she is and what gender she is meant to be but is hiding it from her father.
Danny wants to be a hero, at least a little, but is mostly happy that she's been blessed with teenage supermodel looks that reflect how she wish she had been born. Danielle doesn't jump into superheroism automatically but deals with a lot of conflicting emotions regarding the process. The older superheroes of the setting are clear that it is a demanding and sometimes traumatizing life.

There are some people who will ask whether this is more a transgender awakening book or a superhero book. It's definitely both and the two don't conflict too much. There's perhaps a bit too much time spent on the father (who is, sadly, a one-dimensional piece of crap--but that's just how some parents are) but it is about Danny coming to terms with fact they don't have to be afraid anymore. They are the most powerful girl in the world and that liberation is a universal escapist fantasy that I think will appeal to all readers.

I like the supporting cast and appreciate virtually every character except Danny's family. Graywytch is an ugly bigot but is at least interesting in her reasoning (it offends her witchcraft-based religion), Valkyrja is very entertaining in her attempts to be supportive to Danny, and Doctor Impossible (no, not the one from Soon I will be Invincible) is highly entertaining. I think I loved the character of Calamity, a black teenage cowgirl vigilante, the most.

If I had one complaint, it is the fact that Danny does have to deal with such ugly and vile transphobia throughout the book. It's not that it isn't important for the book but that it is an unfortunate thing that makes the book uncomfortable. That it is something we have to deal with in the real world so often and that it must sadly also be confronted in our escapism. So a warning on the content as it doesn't shy away from the slurs thrown at many transteens in RL.

The highlight of the book for me was the easy friendship between Calamity and Danny. I don't know if Danny and Calamity are going to have a romance (Danny being a gay woman) but I think they'd make a cute couple if they were. I also appreciate how Danny, who is going to inherit the ""whitecape"" (noble paladin type) of Dreadnought, has ended up befriending a ""graycape"" (vigilante) as their friend as well as mentor.

So, did I like it? Oh yes. I picked up the sequel immediately. I should note that April Daniels is also writing from her own experiences with Danny's trans experience and this is something that made me more interested in checking out the book. This doesn't break the mold of superhero literature but that isn't necessary for someone who is looking for something that homages all the classic tropes as well as tells a deeply personal growing up story.",1
882,"Most severely underlooked fantasy sagas to have come out within these last few years?For me it's easily the Aldorean Chronicles by Michael Wisehart (it feels even more like a love letter to Wheel of Time than Licanius) and the Sunsurge Quartet by David Hair.

Are there any books/series like this? And if so, why not? Do you think it's hard to write interesting magic based fantasy in a non-medieval world?

884,"Why are there little to no fantasy series where the bad guys win?I feel like there are plenty of examples outside of fantasy or outside of the medium (movies, tv series, etc.) but I have yet to encounter a story that ends with total victory for evil/the antagonists. Why is that? Is it simply due to the desire of the author to meet the expectations of the audience? Or does it defy the foundations of fantasy itself? Do you think it is possible to do this successfully?

Edit: I should clarify that I'm looking at epic fantasy specifically. I know there are plenty of examples in sci fi or just current day fiction.

Edit edit: There have been a lot of great recommendations that I will check out, thank you for that. But as far as epic fantasy, there are only a handful among a mountain of titles. The Hero's Journey is fairly centric to epic fantasy and the hero losing in the end might feel cheap or incomplete. I think I've come to the unstable conclusion that in order for the story to not come off as cheap, it has to try to accomplish some other goal in its writing. Maybe say something about the human condition. And in doing that, it needs to break from the hero's journey and ceases to be epic fantasy.

**Slice-of-Life/Small-Scale Fantasy (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison

*Description*: After his father and brothers are murdered, the kindhearted son of an emperor must come out of exile to take up his father's throne.

*Review*: This book lived up to its reputation. It's such a tender, humane piece of writing, populated by complex and relatable characters. If it has a major flaw, it's that the storyline which is billed as the main plot goes nowhere. Oh, all the threads are resolved, but with no particular aplomb. But this isn't a book you read for the plot; you read it for the characters and gentle atmosphere. 

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Gray House by Mariam Petrosyan

*Description*: Various teenagers attempt to make sense of their relationships and identities in the context of a boarding school for disabled children--a school that happens to be both alive and rather possessive. 

*Review*: Where do I even start? *The Gray House* is meandering, full of long, grotesque descriptions and unlikable characters, and has no real plot. Moreover, all of these things are true for the entirety of its 721 pages. But it's also *so good*. It creates a world which is absolutely complete unto itself, full of characters with complex psychology and stark, vivid imagery. I can't adequately describe it in a paragraph, but if you enjoy slow, literary fiction at all, it's worth checking out.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**SFF Novella**

*Book*: The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion by Margaret Killjoy

*Description*: A punk-rock anarchist with a bad case of wanderlust stumbles upon a community of like-minded folk, only to discover that its residents are being slaughtered by a dangerous spirit.

*Review*: I wanted to like this book. It had a lot that intrigued me: it's very queer, it's told from a political perspective I've had little exposure to, and it's about a subculture that I've never seen represented in such a positive light. It also has an awesome title. But unfortunately I found that it suffers from rushed pacing and cast that's too large to really connect with in the context of a novella. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it had been a novel, with more time to really flesh out the setting and the characters.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**Self-Published SFF Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: With Strings Attached, or The Big Pink Job by D. Aviva Rothschild

*Description*: \*cough\* Oh lord. In 1980, the four former members of the Beatles--yes, those Beatles--are sent to an alien universe by a group of extra-dimensional undergraduate psychology students and forced to hunt down a big pink statue in exchange for a ticket home.

*Review*: This is way better than it has any right to be. It's also about as un-creepy as a fantasy novel about four real people could be (i.e., no shipping). I read the part that's free online out of morbid curiosity, and then suddenly found myself buying the e-book. It's got complex characterization, original worldbuilding, and some weird, weird shit. There's a bit where John Lennon impersonates an alternate universe version of himself in order to spearhead a civil rights movement for anthropomorphic rabbits. It'd probably benefit from a good editor--it's bulky--but I was never too bothered. Believe me, I had reservations, but it's actually pretty good.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring Twins (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Black Tides of Heaven by J. Y. Yang

*Description*: The twin children of a monarch struggle to maintain their bond in the midst of political upheaval. 

*Review*: Like *The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion*, I think this book tried to do too much in too little time. Yang does some incredible worldbuilding, and presents very interesting ideas for characters and a story, but somehow the disparate pieces never quite coalesced into a compelling whole. I may still check out the other books in this series, though, so it did something right.

*Rating*: 2.5/5.

**Novel Featuring Vampires (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Carry On by Rainbow Rowell

*Description*: Caught up in his people's war to preserve their magic, the Chosen One falls in love with his archenemy as he struggles to cope with the knowledge that he probably won't live to see adulthood. A take-off on *Harry Potter*.

*Review*: A solid YA romance layered over with some genuinely clever worldbuilding, a fun plot, and well-drawn characters. I'm not usually a ""magic system"" kind of person, but I found this one, in which magic words are discovered among the idioms and memes in common use among non-magical people, to be fun to explore and think about.

*Rating*: 3.5/5.

**Graphic Novel**

*Book*: White Sand, Vol. 2, written by Brandon Sanderson and illustrated by Julius M. Gopez

*Description*: The runt of a clan of sand wizards must seek support and avoid assassination after unexpectedly becoming the leader of his people.

*Review*: I did not find this to be Sanderson's best work. There's nothing exactly wrong with it, but there's nothing really right with it either. There's not much clever Sanderson-y plotting and all the characters fit into more-or-less standard archetypes. It has fun moments, and I will dutifully read volume three, but this was not inspiring.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**SFF Novel by an Author Local to You**

*Book*: Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix

*Description*: An unmotivated employee of an Ikea knock-off must pull a night shift in order to investigate strange goings-on in the store. A ghost story. 

*Review*: This book finds its premise in the ""scripted disorientation"" deliberately created by the architects of big box stores and the economic desperation of many of the people working in them. It has tight pacing, gory thrills, and a few moments of surprisingly poignant commentary on what it's like to be working class in postindustrial America. It's predictable, yes, but also essentially well-crafted. If you a.) like ghost stories and b.) have ever worked retail, this is a fun, quick read.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**SFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting**

*Book*: The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

*Description*: A queen, a priestess, and a would-be dragon rider must navigate their deep-rooted ideological differences in order to save the world from an ancient evil.

*Review*: This is another one I really wanted to like. It accomplishes a lot, but not in comparison with its ambition. The prose is pretty, even veering into beautiful at times. The dragons are as awesome as dragons should be. But the pacing is uneven, first very slow and then rushed at the end, and the plot itself is pure fantasy cliché. Somehow it suffers both from a lack of space and a lack of ideas. It was the kind of book I liked as I was reading it, but liked less and less the more I thought about it.

*Rating*: 2.5/5.

**Cyberpunk (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami

*Description*: A man who downloads data directly into his brain in order to encrypt it for the shadowy company he works for finds himself caught in the middle of that company's war with a sinister cabal. 

*Review*: Ignore the description above; it is woefully inadequate. If you've ever read a Murakami novel, you know the man writes weird. This is weirder. This is the weirdest book on a list featuring *The Gray House* and a Beatles-themed epic fantasy. It's good, though. Like a lot of Murakami books, it suffers from its strange descriptions of women and sex, and it's not exactly an action-packed thriller. But as you drift from one bizarre image to the next, it all does add up to something worthwhile. As with *The Gray House*, I'd recommend it only if you have a tolerance for literary and/or experimental fiction.

*Rating*: 3.5/5.

**Second Chance**

*Book*: The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle

*Description*: Upon learning she may be the last of her kind, a unicorn ventures out from her forest to seek her people.

*Review*: This is the greatest book I have ever completely failed to connect to. I can see why people love it so much. It's funny and sad and magical in a way reminiscent of childhood. The prose is hauntingly beautiful. There's no idea explored within it that the author does not take just a step further than another writer might, deepening and complicating it. But for some reason I couldn't enjoy it. The entire time I was reading it, I just wanted it to be over, and I have no clue why.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Afrofuturism**

*Book*: An Unkindness of Ghosts by Rivers Solomon

*Description*: A person enslaved on a generation ship seeks out the truth of her mother's disappearance while trying to survive political turmoil and an overseer's grudge.

*Review*: The characterization in this is brilliant, full of layered emotion and perfectly selected detail. Solomon creates intense people and intense experiences, and pours them over the reader like a bucket of colorful powder. This book is grim and seething with anger, but all the violence (sexual and otherwise) never felt gratuitous to me. I could easily have rated this five stars if the plot had been as well-crafted as every other element; as it is, it kind of falls apart at the end. Still, well worth the read.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Fantasy Novel Published in 2019 (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Infinite Noise by Lauren Shippen

*Description*: A high school football player in therapy to cope with his supernatural empathy grows closer to a boy with depression.

*Review*: I read this because the idea of therapy for people with superpowers intrigued me. I wasn't expecting much, and not much is what I got. It has a sweet romantic A-plot and . . . that's it. Nothing else happens. Even in the romance, there's minimal conflict, just a couple of minor kerfuffles that add up to nothing. On the positive side, it's a feel-good story with some worthwhile messages about mental illness (namely, that love can't cure it).

*Rating*: 1.5/5.

**Middle Grade SFF Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman

*Description*: Equipped with a mysterious device that will truthfully answer any question, a young girl flees her sinister guardian to rescue her best friend from a mysterious organization of child-snatchers.

*Review*: Why did I wait so long to read this series? It's incredible. Lyra is the perfect protagonist, a perfect blend of bravery and vulnerability, recklessness and deep competence. The daemon concept is a storytelling coup, one of the best uses of magic-as-metaphor I've ever seen. And this series is full of that kind of startling imagination. I could write for ages about why *His Dark Materials* is so great, and I wouldn't be the first to do so. If you haven't read it, just try it.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**A Personal Recommendation from** r/Fantasy 

*Book*: Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb

*Description*: The bastard son of a beloved prince is trained as an assassin to serve the family that won't acknowledge him while navigating deadly court intrigue.

*Review*: This is another series I waited way too long to read. For years, I've heard about Robin Hobb's legendary skill with characterization, and I have to say, I finally understand her reputation. Fitz is the kind of character who takes up a place in your soul, and what's more, feels like he's always been there. He's painfully real, as are many of the people around him. On top of that, the book is written with wonderful attention to the everyday, so that you really feel like you're living Fitz's life alongside him, rather than just seeing the most interesting highlights.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**An** r/Fantasy **Book Club Book of the Month/Read-Along Book**

*Book*: Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey

*Description*: A courtesan-priestess chosen by an angel to be a perfect masochist fights to save her country from threats both internal and external.

*Review*: I read a number of great books for this challenge, but this is probably my favorite. Contrary to its reputation as kinky erotica with a fantasy veneer, this is actually an old-fashioned adventure story that just happens to have a fair amount of tastefully-done BDSM. It's told in first person and relies  heavily on the character's exceptional narrative voice. The plot is kept on a slow burn, which I found completely satisfying, as it left a lot of room for fascinating worldbuilding and character work. This is a quality book that even my asexual self managed to wring a lot of enjoyment out of.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**Media Tie-In Novel (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Superman: Dawnbreaker by Matt de la Peña 

*Description*: Young Clark Kent investigates disappearances among Smallville's Hispanic immigrants while struggling to decide what he wants to do with his powers.

*Review*: I'm a sucker for Superman media, and so snatched this up immediately. Unfortunately, it is in no way good. The politics are blindingly unsubtle; even if you agree with the author's points, which I do, they're just clumsily made. It's the progressive equivalent of one of those bad religious movies where any semblance of a good story is lost in the ""message.""

*Rating*: 1/5.

**Novel Featuring an AI Character**

*Book*: Hyperion by Dan Simmons

*Description*: Seven pilgrims share their stories as they seek out a terrifying creature known as the Shrike, who may kill all of them, but who also may grant one of them their deepest desire.

*Review*: This book took me months to read. Not because I didn't like it, but because I unwisely started it during my last semester of grad school. That said, even with continual interruptions, its brilliance came through. It checks every box on the good storytelling checklist and then makes up a few of its own. It even made me cry.

*Rating*: 5/5.

**SFF Novel With a Title of Four or More Words**

*Book*: The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow

*Description*: In the early twentieth century, a teenage girl raised in a wealthy but lonely household discovers a talent for opening portals to other words.

*Review*: This book is beautiful in many ways. Its prose, its careful attention to the social injustices of its time period, and its sparklingly imaginative details all work in its favor. But I still didn't find it entirely satisfying. Maybe it felt a little twee. Still, it's good.

*Rating*: 4/5.

**Retelling!** 

*Book*: Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik

*Description*: After gaining a reputation for her ability to ""turn silver into gold,"" a moneylender's daughter is kidnapped by the king of the fairies. Meanwhile, the new bride of the tsar discovers the dark secret at her nation's heart.

*Review*: This book was almost five stars, save for one unfortunate choice at the end. But apart from that one thing I won't spoil, it's marvelous: it has competence porn centered on an awesome cast of women, terrifying use of the environment as an antagonist, and old-fashioned fairy tale magic, both literal and metaphorical. It has characters you ache for and a villain you can sincerely want dead. I've gone back months later to reread passages.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.

**SFF Novel by an Australian Author**

*Book*: The Shadow of What Was Lost by James Islington

*Description*: A young man discovers he can use a hated form of magic, and must set out on a quest to prevent the re-emergence of an evil long thought dormant.

*Review*: In this series, ~~mages~~ the Gifted are forced to live in prisons known as ~~Circles~~ Tols overseen by ~~Templars~~ Administrators. When they come of age, the must pass a magical test known as the ~~Harrowing~~ Trials, lest they be made ~~Tranquil~~ Shadows. This system is the historical result of a war to overthrow the magocracy of the ~~Magisters~~ Augurs. ...Okay, Licanius is far from a total Dragon Age rip-off, but I had to get that out there. On the whole, I found this book to be pretty mediocre epic fantasy. It had a few good twists, but was ultimately just kind of bland and trope-y.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**The Final Book of a Series (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Powers by Ursula K. Le Guin

*Description*: After his sister is murdered by his master's son, a young man runs away from slavery to learn about his origins and the strange power that he has kept hidden his entire life. The final book in *The Annals of the Western Shore*.

*Review*: Like everything I've read by Le Guin, this book pays careful attention to social realism and to its characters' humanity. There's nothing I'd call action as such. Just people living their lives the best they can in whatever circumstances they find themselves. *Powers* maybe isn't as inspired as some other Le Guin books, but it's consistently interesting and solidly written.

*Rating*: 3/5.

**#OwnVoices (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: A Taste of Honey by Kai Ashante Wilson

*Description*: Caught in a romance forbidden by his culture, a young man navigates the conflict between his duty to his family and his love for a handsome foreign soldier.

*Review*: The fantasy elements in this book are well-implemented and creative, but ultimately take a backseat to the more personal parts of the story. With lush prose and strong characterization, Wilson handles the novella format very well, getting a lot done in a short time without being overambitious. Stylistically this is one of the best books on this list. It also has a killer ending. 

*Rating*: 4/5.

**LitRPG (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Changing Faces by Sarah Lin

*Description*: An RPG villain switches bodies with the game's protagonist and learns that his world is little more than a playground for beings from another dimension. 

*Review*: This was fun. I don't want to be condescending, but if I'm honest, there's no single element here that rises above the level of mediocre fan fiction. Still, it has real heart and is often quite funny. I can see why this genre has a following--it's a typical progression fantasy, but stripped of adulterants and shot right into your veins. I doubt I'll ever read another LitRPG, but I'm glad I read this one.

*Rating*: 2/5.

**Five SFF Short Stories (Hard Mode)**

*Book*: Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler

*Description*: A collection of science fiction short stories on various topics, often with themes humanity trying to maintain its dignity when confronted with more advanced species or with disease.

*Review*: I mean, it's Octavia Butler. Isn't that enough? I put off reading this collection for about a year, because it was the last Butler book I hadn't read. It was as good as thought it would be. Each story has Butler's typical clarity and painstaking psychological realism. Some are inevitably stronger than others, but every one is worth reading. They all do what speculative short fiction is supposed to do: explore an idea in a brief and focused way, with no frills and no reaching outside the scope of the story. And her ideas are always so much bigger, so much more wonderful and more horrifying, than almost anybody else's.

*Rating*: 4.5/5.",1
889,"I just finished reading Lirael, and I have a question (Spoilers)So Lirael is Sabriel's half-sister.  Based on the dark mirror, she was conceived very shortly before the events in Sabriel.  Except at the end of the book, Sam (the younger of Sabriel and Touchstone's children) is 17 and Lirael is 19.  How old is Ellimere?  I don't think a number is ever put on her, but I had the impression that she's a couple of years older than Sam, which would make her the same age as Lirael.

896,"The dialogue in Steel Crow Saga is distracting and (after a while) frustrating/irritating. Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not. Thoughts?Steel Crow Saga started off so good, but now I'm just kind of bored.
I bought it because the banter between Lee and the Princess was amazing at first, but now I'm just kinda of irritated by Lee's constant snark/ill-timed jokes. I know it's supposed to be funny, and it was, but now I'm just frustrated with her. And I also find the whole Shade summoning thing to be a bit cheesy. I say this knowing it's supposed to be in reference to pokemon (of which I'm a fan). But I just am not feeling it. I also have no idea where the plot is going, and I dont really care anymore. :/
I mean no offense to anyone who loves this book, but am I the only one who feels like this?

Especially in the dark fantasy aspect since I am more interested in it, but what I realized is that most fantasy games, especially the western ones, completely lack creativity, uniqueness, fantasy and magic, their settings, monsters, worlds, magic and fantasy elements in general have this problem. And I don't want to get into that flop that most fantasy games have so I wanted to know guys if you can recommend me ways to increase my fantasy and creativity in general so I can make a decent fantasy game someday that nails the dark fantasy aspect. Because even though I mostly play fantasy games (yeah, that's how much I love fantasy) I believe that I completely lack the creativity that the creators of those fantasy games have.

898,"Recommendations for an all Graphic Novel r/fantasy bingo cardSo, last year as I got so close to doing a graphic novel version of the r/fantasy bingo card, I decided that this year (well technically the 2019 one) I would try to do a complete one.  Despite having read a tonne of comics this year, I've had startling few that would fit into the catergories for bingo (or i've ended up reading the entire series). I'm looking for recommendations in the following catergories: 

Character with a Disablity

Novella - Honestly I'm not sure how you would judge this one so it might be better to have as my one swap out.

Self published 

Vampires

Local Author - if anyone can think of someone who is close to Birmingham, UK that would be awesome. (So far the only one I've read that is a B'ham author wasn't an SFF comic)

Cyberpunk

Afrofuturism - I've been stuck trying to find something that isn't Black Panther. 

Personal Rec - I like comics, the more fun the better! I've read a lot of comics published by Image so something a little more obscure would be amazing!

Four or more word title - I don't know if I should be counting subtitles so I've been trying not to.

899,"Dwarven carrots/mushroom 'beer' experiments: resultsSince [my previous post/rant](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/eqk4to/generic_fantasy_dwarven_beer_is_carrot_wine_let/) about Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer being likely made of carrots (and/or, as others have suggested in the thread, mushrooms) drew some interest, I thought I would post an update on my brewing experiments on the topic (one absolutely horrid, but the other surprisingly promising). I am not entirely sure if that's allowed here - apologies if it's too off-topic for this subreddit - but the overall idea is to see what a hypothetical stereotypical Dwarven civilization with little access to barley (or potatoes - to me, potatoes always seem kind of out of place in medieval-ish fantasy, even though Tolkien himself had no problems putting them in his books) could brew.

As I mentioned in the previous thread, the whole line of thought began because I was making a purple carrot and ginger 'beer' (like ginger beer, it was meant to be more a weird soda than a proper beer - sweeter, negligible ABV, no need of aging beyond a day or two, does not keep long) and I thought that carrots are much more ""dwarfy"" than barley. Since others in the thread mentioned mushrooms, and since that sounded like an amusing idea (one of the things I like about making ginger beer is that, since the ingredients and time investment is much smaller and they don't need much aging, you can try all sorts of nonsense and not be too disappointed if it doesn't pan out), I took some dried mushrooms, minced them, boiled them in water for half an hour, let cool, added the whole thing to the fermenting batch and let rest for a couple of days before bottling and putting in the fridge.

That... did not go well, to say the least. The brew took a rather concerning reddish color (photos at the end); but aesthetics aside, it ended up being much more dry and boozier than I expected - the ABV of ginger beer is usually at most 2%, generally much less, but one could absolutely get drunk on my ginger carrot mushroom abomination (I did not take gravity readings and so I don't know the exact ABV, but I would not be surprised if it were more than 5%). Tasting notes are... well, gross. It does not taste at all like carrots or like mushrooms. I would say that it tastes like a particularly bad prison wine, but I'm pretty sure that no prisoner is *that* desperate for a drink. This is not a drink fit for Dwarves, it is something that even Illithids would feel bad about giving to their thralls. Since I had already made it, and since I'm pretty certain it is not infected (that's usually quite recognizable and it's not it - my guess is that carrots simply have far more fermentable sugars than I expected and the yeast went crazy), I'll let it age for a few weeks and see if it mellows into something halfway drinkable, but I'm not counting on it.

But real Dwarves do not surrender. For my next attempt at making a dwarfy fermented drink, I ditched the carrots and the ginger and the other flavorings and kept things as simple as possible - dried mixed mushrooms, water, sugar, and that's it (credit for the idea goes to [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/eqk4to/generic_fantasy_dwarven_beer_is_carrot_wine_let/fetzl9a/) by u/ImShyBeKind). I did not even use the mushrooms directly at all - rather, I poured boiling water on dried mushrooms, let cool, strained out the mushrooms (which went into my dinner), added sugar to mushroom water, bring to boil, let cool, added yeast, let ferment for a day and something before bottling (in plastic: it might not be lore appropriate, but glass could have been dangerous and I was fresh out of stone jars) This one worked a lot better! I was concerned that the mushrooms would lend no taste at all, but instead I got a distinctly mushroomy-tasting (and looking!) beverage that tastes surprisingly good. As intended, it's more a weird soda than any sort of beer (I'd be surprised if ABV gets to 1% - next time I'll check, and there will be a next time); but the mushroomy sugary flavor is there and is much better than I expected. I could see myself drinking something like that while playing an appropriately dwarfy DnD campaign (if I could find a group to play DnD with without the campaign fizzling out after two sessions at most, but eh). And if one is in the mood for something a little stronger, adding a bit of rum (much like you'd do in a rum and coke) works really well too, I tried. If I may make a criticism, the taste however does not have that much depth - there's the mushrooms, there's the sugar, and that's it. Next time, I'll try adding small amounts of other flavorings and see what happens. But for now, I think that the quest for a properly Dwarven 'beer' is progressing nicely.

[Pictures are here](https://imgur.com/a/PPmuzEv). 

If someone is curious, I can give the full recipe (of the mushroom soda, not of the carrot ginger mushroom Thing That Should Not Be), but it's really.super simple: the only things to worry about are to keep the bottle in fridge and to open it to let it ""burp"" every day or so to avoid bottle geygers...",1
900,"Asking in real life folklore terms, were there any mentions of a witcher in folklore?(Just asking if there were any kinds of monster hunters by the name of witchers in European folklore.

Listening to Blood Song, I remembered that I liked the potential romantic relationship that was building, though sadly thrown away to another part of the world, never to be heard from again. Literally.

I need closure and just to just feel young again (lol) so if anyone has some good suggestions on some books that go along the coming of age with a romantic subplot, I'd highly appreciate it!",1

905,"Books similar to Nightlord by Garon WhitedLooking for recommendations of books that are similar to Nightlord. I like that the books are written in the perspective of the main character but any recommendations do not have to be the same. The world building and main character progression is probably the best I've come across and spands genres that I thought were incompatible.

 I think the parts I enjoy the most are the base building parts that can evolve into kingdom building and civilization building.

I also love the mix between science, technology and magic as well as the explanations the main character gives while creating new spells or enchanting. The monologues the main character gives can spand entire chapters, some people might find it boring, but I think it's the best parts. 

I do believe Garon is in a genre and league of his own, but if you have ever read the series and come across anything similar, please let me know.",1

907,"Are you tired of magic in fantasy?In almost every fantasy book in fact I think every single fantasy book I’ve read there has been a magic system. Also this isn’t to hate on magic. I think it can be great help progress the story add new twists to a world and more, but I just have gotten a bit tired of it in every fantasy novel. Yes theres often unique magic systems but its still.... magic. I would love to read something new with no magic system. What I mean is no harry potter ish magic. So spells, Alchemy, Rituals, etc not every fantastical thing like fantasy races. What are your guys‘ thoughts?",1
908,"The Bone Ships by RJ Barker 

I read and adored RJ Barker’s other series, The Wounded Kingdom, and I had this one high up on my list for my 2020 TBR. I splurged recently on a bunch of audiobooks and I knew that this had to be one of them – I had already waited too long to read this one!

If you follow my reviews you know that I almost always cite my need to get to know the characters before I can care about what else going on. This was different. It was the world-building that sucked me in. That isn’t to say I didn’t enjoy the in-depth grey characters that were delivered in this, but the world was so… surreal and other-worldly it reminded me why I picked up fantasy books so long ago.

Our characters live on ships made of the bones of sea-dragons in a post-apocalyptic world like I’ve never seen before. Lucky Mes has been banished to the Black Ships, the ship of the dead. She conspired to commit treason by making allies of enemies and ending the brutal ritual of child sacrifice. Lucky Mes was made famous by surviving said child sacrifice. It’s said that she caused and then survived a tidal wave defying the custom of slaying the firstborn child of all mothers. Covered in mostly water, the world is dotted with islands that have been at war with each other for so long no one remembers why it started in the first place. Propaganda plagues both the Gaunt Islanders and the 100 islanders alike, each believing the other to be unreasonable barbarians. Lucky Mes hopes to bring the two factions together and find peace between them. Women and men appear to be equals – homosexuality isn’t just normal, it’s the law when on a Black Ship. A man and a woman having sex could create a child and it’s punishable by death.

I found myself loving Lucky Mes and her take-no-shit attitude. She’s incredibly badass but also has a genuinely good purpose and goal, she’s not just a cutthroat asshole like most of those who make up the Black Ships. To be sentenced to the Black Ships you must have committed a crime, and so she’s surrounded by a ton of unsavory characters. This had a grim and foreboding tone most of the time with death lurking around the corner for just about everyone. Joron was really more of our main character, however, and he’s loses his leadership at the very start of the book to none other than Lucky Mes. He’s an alcoholic who sold his maps for more booze, he was picked to be Ship Wife not because he was strong but because he was weak. His crew didn’t want to have a hard-ass leader, so they picked a coward. He had no respect from anyone and has to try and earn it once Lucky Mes takes over.

The world building, as I said earlier, is amazing. There are alien-like bird-people called Windtalkers that can control the weather and the wind. They have their eyes taken from them at birth, they are hunched and sit so completely still they look unnatural and because of that they give everyone on the ship the creeps. Joron and the Tide Child have happened upon a Windtalker that refuses to talk until Lucky Mes…and when he finally does agree to call the wind, it’s the most powerful spell Lucky Mes has ever seen. There are giant eyeless worms that ride the wake of the ships… they bring an unfortunate and brutal end to anyone who falls into the water. This is a world where most women can’t produce children, and many who are born are born with deformities. I could write paragraph after paragraph of how unique and engrossing the world building was, but, that’ll make this review stupidly long.

I didn’t notice how long this book was, I kept turning the page despite how exhausted I was from working all day and coming home to take care of a baby. I just kept fucking reading until 3am when I finally finished. I can’t wait to read the next in a series and that’s saying something because I almost never finish a series anymore.

I don’t read many at-sea adventures, so that was also very refreshing and change of pace for me. The narrator is very good, but also pretty slow. I generally listen at 1.5x but cranked it to 1.8 for this narrator.

***TLDR: Incredible other-worldly feel, unique and original races/creatures, fascinating post-apocalyptic landscape and culture. Grey characters, adventure at sea, trying to end a war, and monsters all written with professional prose that will keep you turning pages. Audiobook was excellent.***

909,"Does anyone know what Children’s Fantasy book I’m thinking of?When I was a child I read a book. I can’t remember what the title was, just a few minor details.

1) It involved 2-3 children who were supposed to be part of a play on Greek mythology getting sent back in time.

2) they meet the Greek gods

3) the one with the (fake) golden Apple is asked to choose between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite but can’t remember who it’s supposed to go to.

4) Zeus asks the kid dressed like a Cyclopes why he has three eyes.

5) Zeus throws a tin foil lightning bolt he got from the other kid (thinking its real) at Hades? Head.

910,"An Fond Farewell to My Old BooksI spent the first 18 years of life in my childhood home in New Jersey, and after 30 years my parents are finally moving.  Today, my mom messaged me and asked if I wanted to keep my old Harry Potter and Dark Tower books...And it was painful, but I said no!  In 2012, I got my trusty kindle (currently kicking strong for my foray into the Gentleman Bastard series which I cannot recommend highly enough) and as such have no need for my old paperback collection.  I live in NYC where space is a commodity, and fitting my hoard of books isn't really an option.

It's hard, but I'm saying goodbye to so many amazing memories.  The Forgotten Realm Series, everything Tolkien, Riftwar Saga, Pendragon (I got a callout in the acknowledgements section - one of the highlights of my childhood), Wheel of Time, Eragon, Earthsea, The 5th Ring, Chronicles of Amber...The list goes on endlessly.  I'm going to miss going home and looking through them all, but it brings me a ton of joy knowing that they'll be donated and hopefully help another kid experience all the same adventures that I did.

I figured a few of you have been through this yourself, and would appreciate the post :)

911,"What are some fun/kind of silly fantasy story like A Spell For Chameleon that are also less... uncomfortable?I read Castle Roogna when I was a teen and I remember being kind of charmed by its spritely approach to fantasy, with the concepts of zombies and talking spiders just being like a neighborhood surprise. It kind of reminds me of the vibe of the King's Quest games.

I decided to pick up the first of the Xanth books, A Spell For Chameleon, and it was coming along pretty much the same, with talking trees, centaurs and stuff.

And then the main character attends a trial over a rape accusation. And shortly after there're more than a few suggestions that the lead could be tempted by a pretty girl to do something that would also put him on trial. I mean... I know Castle Roogna also acknowledged sexual topics but they were pretty PG. This is just... yeesh. Especially seeing as it otherwise reads like a book for young readers.

Not to mention that on two occasions now, the book's implied that 14-yr old girls are enticing.

So yeah, I'd like to find out about some goofy fantasy stories that are less of... all that.",1

If you haven't tried it yet, you should be giving it a read - noirish, Dickens-ish/Victorian kind of world feel, with some steampunk elements, and some downright weird-s\*\*t going on... lots of players, lots of agendas, and lots to enjoy for the reader.

I'd best get on with the sequel!",1
915,"I'm looking for recommendationsWhat are your favorite fantasy books that are set in another world and have some sort of magic in them?

In the past year and a half I've been getting back into fantasy after quite a long break from reading. So far I've encountered a lot of urban fantasy and vampire books, but they just don't touch my heartstrings in the old Tolkien sense of way. I've also read a bit of fantasy romance, but I don't prefer those, even if they can also be exciting. I'd rather not have romance, at least not as the main theme. 

For example I liked the Bridge Kingdom by Danielle L. Jensen, but hated her Stolen Songbird series. The plot was way better in the former and the latter reminded me of Twilight. I liked Uprooted by Naomi Novik, but not the romance part of it. Same goes for The Ghost Bride by Yangsze Choo. 

I've read most of N.K. Jemisins books and enjoy them very much, although they are a bit dark. 

I gave up on A Song of Ice and Fire #5 at pp 130 because it was just too damn long and there was nothing happening in it. I adored the first three books in the series though. 

I've read the first Mistborn book by Sanderson. The beginning was so slow and long, I struggled to get through it, but man, the ending was so worth it. It was masterful. I'm definitely going to continue reading the series, but I need a break. However, I hated the first Stormlight archive book and gave up after 4 chapters. It was the first book by Sanderson I read, but then I saw him say in a lecture that it wasn't perhaps the best choice until you got to know his style more first and learned to trust him. So...maybe I'll try again later.

I like Philip Pullman's Northen Light's series and I've of course also read Harry Potter and everything Tolkien a long time ago and loved those.

I loved the Forest Kingdom by Simon R. Green. It was light, funny and satyrical. 

I DNFd Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett.

I've tried starting several more books, but so many of them start slow and heavy. I just want to be swept up in a book in the first chapter right now.

Can you guys recommend any quick paced, funny adventure fantasies in alternate worlds with magic? I'm really craving that now. Like really really.

No middle grade books, please. I don't mind YA if it's without romance, but I prefer adult. I go for any type of magic system, soft or hard, I don't care as long as there is magic. Humor is always a big plus.",1
916,"Why do you like your favorite books?What about your favorite books makes them your favorite? Also if you don't like other popular books/series what about them prevents you from enjoying them?

I love Malazan, Stormlight and recently the Licanius trilogy. While Malazan is definitely different than the other two, they all have a high level of ""Epicness"" and satisfying conclusions that tie in to the rest of the books. 

I specifically like how Stormlight's conflict has been growing with the emergence of its magic system, and a lot of the moments in the second and third books have more of an impact because of the work done in Way of Kings to establish the world.

Malazan is just high fantasy all the time and while that can make the magic seem normal after a few books, Memories of Ice is probably my favorite book of all time because of how well it expands on Gardens of the Moon and how complete the story feels by the end.

I've been impressed by Licanius from about half-way through the first book until that final conclusion because of how tight-knit the plot is and everything comes together very smoothly. It really feels like The whole story was well thought out before the author even started writing book one. The only thing I don't like about a plot that's so woven together is just that it removes really any of the mystery by the end. I like those big reveal kind of moments but I enjoy having a few unanswered questions to think about when I've finished a book/series.

As far as a popular series I am not a fan of, Wheel of Time is unfortunately my go to. I've really tried to like this series but I cant get over a lot of the more well known flaws, especially the drawn-out plot and the unrealistic female characters. The long paragraphs of description never bothered me as I tend to skim those sections in most books I read, though I couldn't really say why.

I'd love to read some other/contrasting opinions to mine, what do you all think?",1
917,"Witcher saga and Forgotten Realms Legend of Drizzt GraphicaudioI would pay buckets of money to hear  Graphicaudio productions of The legend of Drizzt and Witcher series!

Victor Bevine does a really good job but it's still very enjoyable to have the sound effects of combat music etc. and individual voices imo.

If I had to choose one over the other to become graphicaudio it would definitely be The Witcher saga, because from hearing the sample of the audible narrated by Peter Kenny I just don't think I could enjoy the story because his accent and voice is just too much. 

Not exactly annoying, but just completely different from the narrating I like, such as Michael Kramer, and of course Victor Bevine.

My question: She's in disguise and fleeing for her life at that point, and the rose, of course, is back at the palace, and the entire city is searching for her. How did she get the rose from the palace to the doctor?

But apart from that, I think the Sarantine Mosaic is my very favorite GGK tale, other than perhaps Last Light of the Sun. (Also, I misspelled his name in the title line, I know!)",1

920,"What are fantasy/Sci fi books that surprised you and that disappointed you?Basically a book you had high hopes for that disappointed you and a book that you had few hopes for that surprised you positively. To make my own example:

-Disappointed: Dune by Frank Herbert. I actually liked the book but was expecting more than what I got. I like the idea of the book and its background more than the book itself, the worldbuilding and plotting are wonderful, specially the former, and I honestly can't say it was bad at all, but I didn't enjoy reading it too much, and I was expecting more from the writting and the characterization. I thought it was fine, but it's its vision and influence that elevate the work into the status of being a masterpiece. It's the kind of book I admire more than I like, like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevski.

-Surprised: A Feast for Crows by George RR Martin. The infamous ugly duck in the series, I was expecting to be bored to tears, but it was much more enjoyable than I expected. Sure it might be my least favourite in the series, but it's not as bad as I expected it to be, it's biggest problem comes from the fact that it doesn't feel like a novel anymore, more like a streamline of story archs put together that flow like one continues block of storytelling, and that it got so generous in worldbuilding and background descriptions that it might have been a boring experience for some readers. Most of the favourite POVs are absent and instead you get things like Brienne or Sam. But I honestly can't hate a book with Brienne's second half, or Cersei's arch or Jamie's final chapter. Arya and Sansa were wonderful, but they feel more uncomplete, and ADWD didn't satisfy readers enough for this. It's not perfect, but I still consider it to be a great book.

So what about you? What book did you find disappointing or surprising?",1
921,"What is the appeal of Dungeon Core?Asking as someone unfamiliar with the genre who only recently started reading LitRPG.

In Last First Snow, Mina does not participate in the rising (she runs off with Caleb after his father applies the scars), and she was alive and well in the last scene of the book...

924,"Authors, how much of a boost in sales do you see when giving away a free book?So, as a longtime lurker of this sub, it's not too uncommon to see an author giving away a free first-book when they've published a sequel, or for a debut author to make their book free for the first few days.

I assume that the point is to get people hooked on the series once they read the first book, and to spread word of mouth. How much does this actually affect your sales, though?

I generally treat free books as I treat free games on my steam library - I purchase them (when they're free) and then proceed to forget about them. I've read maybe a handful of the free books I've purchased.

And yet, people keep giving out free books, so there *must* be a benefit here on the authors part, meaning that people like me aren't significant. So my question, dear authors who lurk on this subreddit is this: how much of a boost of sales did you notice after giving away a free book?

927,"[Review] Balance of Magic by Jeffrey L. KohanekI'm a little slow getting this posted this was a review request from the author. Thank you to Jeffrey Kohanek for the ARC. Sorry it's so late.

\-

&amp;#x200B;

Following the death of the wizard Taladain, our friends are on the run. The princess Narine fearing her brother (Prince Eldalain) will blame her for their father, Lord Taladain’s death escapes with Jace, Rhoa and Salvon along with her lifelong friend and bodyguard Adyn.

\-

The Balance of Magic picks up almost directly after the events of Eye of Obscurance and is just as fast paced and fun as the first. The world has gotten a little more complicated as it opens up and we meet new characters and travel to new places. As the plot thickens some of the minor characters get bigger arcs and their backstories filled in this time around.

**Of our friends-**

Narine moves into the limelight, as she and Jace are developing a relationship. Rawk meets up with an uncle who was kicked out of the clan, the same as himself. And Salvon believes Rhoa is the anomaly that was predicted, and is immune to magic and illusions.

**Of our villains-**

Cordelia is working behind the scenes for whoever benefits her guild the most. Rindle is still trying to prove himself better than Jace. Eladain intends to declare martial law, therefore handing the throne and power of the Fastella to himself (at least for the next few months). And Parsec’s is working towards challenging Eladain, for that same throne.

That was just the tip of the iceberg.

I always worry I’m not going to be able to keep everyone straight because there are so many characters and so much going on with them and you all know me and my notorious inability to remember names (this is why all my bunnies just inherit by default any name of a rabbit they look similar to). But I have learned with Jeffrey Kohanek to not stress too much about it because it all works itself out in the wash. As the unimportant people fall away, and the main characters move forward, those characters usually have enough quirks or events happening to them that I can keep them straight for the most part.

The only issues I had this time was with the wizards- keeping track of who’s on top in which city, and who’s trying to topple whom, was a bit tricky. It does eventually get easier as the details start sticking.

I can always count on Jeffrey Kohanek’s books for fast paced entertainment and this didn’t disappoint. With lots of twisty behind the scenes plots as the balance of power shifts from one wizard to another, there are quite a few surprises along the way including the appearance of a magic-based dragon! Always good fun.

Other notes-

This is getting a little more adult with the relationships and a few scenes of gore but still rather mild in comparison to some of what’s out there. I’d let my teen read it but that’s just me.

I mentioned in the review of Eye of Obscurance, how I was sad about Rhoa not having much thought about her leaving her found family and we do get a little here as she sees them in passing and regrets the loss of their company etc. I liked that.

&gt; Four months ago, Cassandra Harwood was the first woman magician in Angland, and she was betrothed to the brilliant, intense love of her life.

&gt; Now Cassandra is trapped in a snowbound house party deep in the elven dales, surrounded by bickering gentleman magicians, manipulative lady politicians, her own interfering family members, and, worst of all, her infuriatingly stubborn ex-fiancé, who refuses to understand that she’s given him up for his own good.

# [**The Magpie Lord**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34715150-the-magpie-lord?) by K. J. Charles

&gt; Exiled to China for twenty years, Lucien Vaudrey never planned to return to England. But with the mysterious deaths of his father and brother, it seems the new Lord Crane has inherited an earldom. He’s also inherited his family’s enemies. He needs magical assistance, fast. He doesn't expect it to turn up angry.

&gt; Magician Stephen Day has good reason to hate Crane’s family. Unfortunately, it’s his job to deal with supernatural threats. Besides, the earl is unlike any aristocrat he’s ever met, with the tattoos, the attitude... and the way Crane seems determined to get him into bed. That’s definitely unusual.

&gt; Soon Stephen is falling hard for the worst possible man, at the worst possible time. But Crane’s dangerous appeal isn't the only thing rendering Stephen powerless. Evil pervades the house, a web of plots is closing round Crane, and if Stephen can’t find a way through it—they’re both going to die.

&gt; Li Lan, the daughter of a genteel but bankrupt family, has few prospects. But fate intervenes when she receives an unusual proposal from the wealthy and powerful Lim family. They want her to become a ghost bride for the family's only son, who recently died under mysterious circumstances. Rarely practiced, a traditional ghost marriage is used to placate a restless spirit. Such a union would guarantee Li Lan a home for the rest of her days, but at a terrible price.

&gt; After an ominous visit to the opulent Lim mansion, Li Lan finds herself haunted not only by her ghostly would-be suitor, but also by her desire for the Lim's handsome new heir, Tian Bai. Night after night, she is drawn into the shadowy parallel world of the Chinese afterlife, with its ghost cities, paper funeral offerings, vengeful spirits and monstrous bureaucracy—including the mysterious Er Lang, a charming but unpredictable guardian spirit. Li Lan must uncover the Lim family's darkest secrets—and the truth about her own family—before she is trapped in this ghostly world forever.

929,"K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season: Syenite's later chaptersI knew I would love the book after thumbing through a few pages, and aftet finishing it I can definitely say it did not disappoint. Essun's chapters were probably my favorite (maybe because of the 2nd person perspective, maybe because of her anger). 

And though I can't say I disliked any of the book, the last few chapters from Syenite's perspective really didn't hold my attention as well. Overall, it didn't make much a difference because I was more than happy to dive into the next book, but I wondered if anyone else felt the same?",1

931,"[Review] The Republic of Thieves by Scott Lynch - Love Sabetha and can't wait to read volume 4#http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1774-therepublicofthieves



4.5/5

The third volume of the Gentleman Bastard series threatens to change the entire course of the series. It is a book which contains a shocking revelation about Locke Lamora's past which, potentially, could alter everything we know about the character. I'm not a big fan of this revelation and the only reason I'm not upset about is due to fact that, being a book about con games, it's entirely possible everything revealed was a lie. So, of course, I'm going to have to purchase the next book to find out if it's true. Clever.

Of course, for a long time it seemed that this would be the last of the Gentleman Bastard series. Scott Lynch ran into a bunch of issues that it's not my place to comment on other than to say he has my deepest sympathy. I'm pleased to have since heard that he's not only completed the 4th book in the series but that he's planning more volumes in this incredibly hilarious yet dark and gritty fantasy epic.

The book's premise is Locke Lamora suffering from poison he ingested in Red Seas Under Red Skies. Jean, his partner in crime, is desperate to find a cure and willing to do anything. The solution comes in the form of Locke and Jean's mortal enemies: the bondsmagi. Introduced in The Lies of Locke Lamora, the bondsmagi were behind the troubles our heroes faced in the previous volume. One of the bondsmagi's leaders, going by the name Patience, is willing to help Locke recover if he and Jean agree to fix an election on the wizards' island of Karthain. This would be small potatoes for the world's greatest con men if not for the fact they're opposed by the only thief and liar equal to them: Locke's ex-girlfriend Sabetha.

Sabetha has been built up for two books as the love of Locke's life and it's a hard task to make us believe she's equal to the task. Much to my surprise, Scott Lynch decided to go a different way. Sabetha is every bit as capable, intelligent, and charming as Locke. She could easily be the star of the series herself. It's just Locke can't see her that way and continually sticks his foot in his mouth due to the inability to see her as anything but his one true loveTM. Sabetha would very much like to be recognized as the world's greatest thief but, beside Locke, she's also regulated to being his supporting cast. She can't stand that. It's an interesting bit of metatextuality since, by nature, Sabetha is a member of Locke's supporting cast. Despite this, she insists on being taken on her own terms. When she refers to her past adventures, they often take on the same sort of life Locke and Jean's do. I, for one, would love to have a Sabetha novel.

Sabetha is an interesting character and one that I think will rub readers either the wrong way or rapidly become their favorite. She has no interest in being the ""perfect girlfriend"" and supportive to Locke but I think all of her issues with him are justified. Their relationship reminds me a great deal of Jackal and Fetch's from The Grey Bastards. Locke has mentally slot Sabetha into the role of being his Maid Marian and he just can't parse that she doesn't want to be his sidekick. It's one of the rare stories where I love the romance while absolutely wanting them not to get together.

Much of the book has a Lupin the Third style comedy-of-errors where Sabetha and Locke keep trying to one up the other in terms of rigging the election. The rest of the book involves an extended flash-back to the heroes joining a troupe of Shakesperian actors with a complete jackass for a troupe master. Needless to say, Locke and Sabetha dig themselves a very deep hole trying to help their (literally) indebted friends. I liked both parts of the book but wish they'd been separate volumes since they don't really fit together well. Still, I think it was a good idea to make sure we were able to see the ""good times"" as well as the ""bad times"" of Sabetha and Locke. The thing is that the bad times don't actually seem to be all that bad as Sabetha and Locke are only friendly rivals at worse for the majority of the book. They may be on opposite sides of a job but neither wishes the other harm.

The book is significantly more lighthearted than previous entries in the series. After the bloody mess of the first and second books, this is a welcome emotional rest. Favorite moments include Locke and Jean getting knocked out and dumped on a luxurious boat out to sea in order to keep them from the election, Locke walking in on Jean while he's losing his virginity (which is a simple but hilarious gag in context), and disposing of a dead nobleman who has 'accidentally' walked into a pair of scissors. Compared to the gritty mission of revenge in The Lies of Locke Lamora and the horrific fate of certain characters in Red Seas under Red Skies, it feels like a walk in the park.

I will say the ending will prove controversial to some readers (myself included) and what it means in the long term is something we'll have to wait for the 4th volume to explain. I do feel one of the choices, bringing back a previous villain, was a mistake since his previous defeat was properly epic. I also think that the ""revelations"" made by another villain work better as lies told in order to destroy Locke's happiness rather than something sincere. Either way, it's a small complaint about a book that I rank as my second favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite dark fantasy novels.

In conclusion, The Republic of Thieves is a significant improvement over the last volume but the twist leaves a sour taste in my mouth. There's also the return of a villain I'd hoped was over and done with. Nevertheless, I'm going to be purchasing the next volume the day it comes out. That, alone, should tell you Scott Lynch has got his hooks into me.",1
932,"Forgotten Fantasies: 4 Mini Reviews of Under-read Specfic NovelsLast year I mostly read new releases that everyone else was buzzing about. And it was great! There were lesbian necromancers in space, lesbian time travelers writing letters, and a lot of doors (ten thousand, to be exact). But part of what I love about the genre is that feeling of discovery when you come across an undiscovered gem, so this year I made a resolution to myself to read more broadly. To that effect, I thought it would be fun to do round-ups of mini-reviews for books with a paucity of reviews on Goodreads. (What counts as ""a paucity""? Whatever I say counts, dear reader, by which I mean I attempted to set a hard limit of ""under 200 reviews"" and then promptly broke that limit when I wrote this post because I wanted to gush about a book with 324 reviews. Oops).

So, what's on tap this time? We've got a nice spread, something for everyone:

* A bitter satire of Canadian academia with horror/magical realism elements
* A near-future feel-good YA thriller featuring an AI addicted to cat pictures
* An atmospheric southwestern urban fantasy with magic horses
* Actually, it's About Ethics in Middle-Grade Minecraft Tie-In Novels

So, without further ado, join me in welcoming...

# [Dr. Edith Vane and the Hares of Crawley Hall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31944733-dr-edith-vane-and-the-hares-of-crawley-hall)

* By Suzette Mayr, published 2017, 174 ratings
* **Bingo categories:** slice-of-life (hard mode), local author (Calgary), four-or-more word title (hard mode), OwnVoices (hard mode)
* **The Story:**  Dr. Edith Vane is a professor English literature at a fictional Canadian university, and a bit of a mess. All she wants to do is research her hero, pioneer housewife memoirist Beulah  Crump-Withers, but everything seems set against her. The school's dean won't talk to her, other professors are out to steal her work, her new girlfriend is playing games with her heart, and the English department's building is possibly sentient and definitely malevolent. And something odd is going on with the campus rabbits...
* **My Take:** I dearly hope the author already has tenure, because this book is *angry*. Everyone in this is terrible: from the business-obsessed university administrators to Edith's bloodthirsty fellow professors to her useless students to Edith herself. Edith *especially*, since you're stuck in her head for 200 pages- she's insecure, spiteful, jealous, and indecisive (and also happens to be a WOC and a lesbian). Of course, the awfulness of Edith and everyone else involved in the University is kind of the book's point: the environment of academia twists everyone and everything it touches, to the extent that the school building itself is an evil force to be reckoned with. The building is a font of creeping wrongness, but the horror elements are subtle; this book won't work if you're looking for out-and-out monsters (in general, the book is much more literary fiction than typical specfic). But if you love or hate academia, relate with wanting to stab your coworkers and/or bosses to death with shitty plastic office cutlery, and think rabbits are creepy AF, you might like this one.

# [Catfishing on Catnet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41556068-catfishing-on-catnet)

* By Naomi Kritzer, published 2019, 324 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** local author (Minneapolis St. Paul), AI (hard mode), published 2019, maybe cyberpunk?
* **The Story:** Steph is your typical teenager, with the not-so-typical twist that she and her mother are constantly moving to keep out of the clutches of Steph's abusive father. Because she never stays in one place for long, Steph has few friends in real life, preferring a tight-knit group of internet friends on the near-future platform known as CatNet. When Steph makes new friends in the real world that are threatened by her father, it's up to CatNet to help. Oh, and CatNet is a sentient AI addicted to pictures of cats.
* **My Take:** I loved this so much! I'd read and loved the short story (famous for winning the Hugo and pissing off the puppies in the process), and had been waiting for the book with bated breath since I heard Kritzer was writing it. It does not disappoint! This is a heartfelt, sweet, and fun story. The tech takes a back seat to the exploration of how online friendships form and function, so anyone looking for hard scifi will likely be disappointed. But if you've ever been on a platform (like, say, Reddit!) where you managed to form those weird close friendships where you know your friend's favorite animal but have no idea what their real name is, this will probably ring true. Also, though the focus is on Steph, CatNet is a delight. Think Murderbot, but way less jaded and way, way more bullish on helping the humans (CatNet is definitely a Gryffindor). Kritzer really manages ""I'm a genius AI that can access information all over the world but also I'm technically not very old and haven't quite figured out when NOT to access all the info. The thriller parts are enjoyable too, though some parts might strike some readers as a bit too coincidence-heavy. The main story wraps up nicely, but there's a hook for a sequel, one I hope Kritzer writes.

# [Dragons in the Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31752269-dragons-in-the-earth)

* By Judith Tarr, published 2016, 34 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** small-scale (hard mode), local author (Arizona), self published (hard mode), four-or-more word title
* **The Story:** Claire is a down-on-her luck former academic with the ability to talk to animals that works on a horse ranch in the Arizona desert. A pair of strangers contacts her with a too-good-to-be-true proposal: watch over a herd of beautiful horses and see to their every need, in exchange for a massive salary, no strings attached. She warily accepts and subsequently falls in love with the horses, but begins to suspect that there's more to them than meets the eye. Throw in Ancient Mesopotamian mythology and a shadowy global corporation, and all bets are off. 
* **My Take:** This was a lovely, gentle read. Claire is a great protagonist: a bit cranky, not so big a fan of humans, and old enough to have aches and pains. Even better were the horses. You can tell Tarr knows and loves horses (she raises and trains Lipizzan horses herself) which is a refreshing antidote to ye fantasy horse machines that dutifully gallop for 9 hours a day and don't eat. All the horses have personalities and temperaments, and the deep and abiding love both Claire and Tarr feel for the horses really shines through. This is also a paean to rural Arizona and the desert, so if that's a setting you enjoy you'll probably like this. The plot takes back-seat to the setting; the focus of the narrative is more on the day to day rhythm of the barn, and I think it was because of this and the relative shortness of the story that the climax felt a bit rushed to me, but I found I really didn't mind.

# [Minecraft: The End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43658932-minecraft)

* By Cat Valente, published 2019, 33 ratings
* **Bingo Categories:** twins (hard mode), published 2019, local author (Maine), middle grade (hard mode), tie-in (hard mode), possibly litRPG (hard mode)
* **The Story:** Fin and Mo are twin endermen that live together in the mysterious world of The End. Shunned by most of their kind, they spend their days scavenging for loot and keeping each other company- until humans invade The End, threatening to kill all of the Endermen and harvest their bodies. But when Fin and Mo come face to face with the humans, they begin to question everything they've ever known about their world, their people, and themselves...
* **My Take:** This book has the highest rating of these four novels on Goodreads but was my least favorite, which just goes to show you that ~~sometimes people are wrong on the internet~~  you shouldn't always trust reviews. First off- and I fully recognize that this isn't quite fair- when I pick up a Valente book, I expect a certain... Valente-ness. And there was a bit, but I got the feeling that she'd decided (or been asked) to massively tone it down. Space Opera this is not. I suppose you could argue it's not fair to expect that level of prose for a middle grade book, but she did it just fine in her Fairyland books. However, my biggest issue was actually the way the ethical issues in the story were resolved, or more accurately, not resolved. Now, I haven't played Minecraft so I'm guessing a bit, but my general understanding is this: in the game, the endermen are not player characters, but monsters that automatically attack players and have to be killed. Valente decided to tell a story from their point of view and give them a culture and language and emotions, etc. When humans show up trying to kill them, they're understandably distraught and afraid, and there's lots of in-book debates about whether the humans are morally wrong. So much of the narrative is devoted to debating this question that it seems pretty clear that ultimately the humans are going to be (rightly) condemned for their actions. And then... they aren't. I'm paraphrasing, but it goes something like: ""You come to our home, you kill us for fun, you harvest our body parts for loot!"" says the enderman. ""Well, yeah,"" says the human, ""but you kill and eat plants, so we're not really so different. Also murder is fun."" I mean, what?! My guess is that Valente realized she couldn't outright condemn the players' actions because this is of course a Minecraft tie-in novel, being marketed primarily to middle-grade readers that are fans of Minecraft. You can't tell a bunch of twelve year olds they're routinely committing genocide and they should be ashamed of themselves, you just can't. But it's weird, because that's clearly the story that was almost, but not quite, being told. Also, the ending is uh, dark in a way I was not expecting; it's revealed that &gt;!the endermen twins are not endermen or twins at all, but human strangers that were caught in an amnesia spell and have been reliving the same brief lives of alienation and abandonment over and over again, unable to escape. Upon realizing this they rally with their new human friends to break free, except they fail and their friends also get caught in the spell and it all starts over again. The fact that the twins aren't even endermen sort of problematizes the whole ""endermen are people too!"" thing that Valente doesn't quite commit to, but I was more boggled that she wrote an outright tragedy lol.!&lt;On a positive note, I did like the baby zombie horse.",1
933,"Any books or series centered around centaurs that are not complete pulp?I find centaurs fascinating creatures with great potential for their own stories, but whatever story I come across, if there are centaurs, there is usually one or two minor centaur characters and that's it.

I was just rereading the first Harry Potter the other day and I found The Forbidden Forest to be among the most interesting parts of the book, mostly because of the centaurs. And later when I was reading up some backstory on Firenze and reminded myself of his appearances in later books, I was like ""Damn, this guy deserves a whole book for himself, if not a series.""

Now, since there is about 1% chance that J. K. Rowling will ever write anything centred on centaurs and/or Firenze, I was wonderijg if there are any books or series which feature centaurs in large part or at least have an interesting centaur character that's not just a minor character? I looked some up, but only found pulp presumably written by some who were just thirsty for centaurs. Anyone got any recommendations?",1
934,"Looking for a lesbian erotic fantasy audiobook... narrated by a womanI love fantasy novels with lesbian themes, and I recently listened to one (can't read in transit, so I have to listen) that had some fairly spicy bits... but having it read by a male narrator seemed *weird*. It was weird enough to take me out of the experience, if that makes sense. I'm wondering if the fantasy would be better with a female narrator.

It's definitely a niche request, but any suggestions are appreciated. Swords and sorcery preferred but sci-fi can be good as well.",1
935,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Last Battle by CS Lewis... would a film adaptation even be possible without backlash or terrible reviews? (spoilers)\-Here are the villains: Calormen (""Colored Men"") who are dark-skinned Muslims, an ape, a cat, Allah who is also Satan because Lewis claims they're the same, and some atheist Dwarves who call the Calormen ""darkies"" multiple times (""darkie"" is an actual slur used in Australia and maybe elsewhere; I mainly saw it used to describe aborigines when I was in Australia). Some have taken Shift the Ape to be a racist metaphor for black people, though I'm not sure I'd agree, but the Calormen are definitely bound to give someone a heart attack if they show up in a film adaptation. The only villain who won't offend anyone is Ginger the cat.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The heroes literally disguise themselves using blackface to blend in with the Calormen.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As mentioned above, Tash = Allah = Satan. If you claim Allah and Jesus are the same, Lewis says you're wrong, and worse, probably damned to hell. Allah is the devil here. This will certainly go over well with modern audiences, like a fart in a submarine. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The problem with Susan. She's now an atheist who thinks Narnia was just a dumb fairy tale. She also likes fashion and boys more than Jesus. She would burn in hell for these grave offenses against God, if only she was present for...

&amp;#x200B;

\-The freak train accident. Everyone's dead except Susan because she was elsewhere having fun. But its cool because they all get to heaven right? Not a tear shed over it, we don't even get to really hear the characters' thoughts on what happened because Aslan tells them they're dead at the very, very end of the book. ""The life you're living now doesn't matter; only when you die and get to heaven will your life really matter"" is apparently the message. Oh and Susan has to mourn HER WHOLE FAMILY. You can't expect the average film audience to accept this as a happy or even bittersweet ending.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The magical stable door thing is confusing. Yes I get that it is a gateway to heaven, a gateway to hell, and a gateway to a purgatory of sorts (the dwarves' fate). But the stable just shows up out of nowhere. Its just there. Why did Aslan choose that for his gate? Why did he choose Shift's deception as his time to end Narnia? Why did Tash even show up? Can we elaborate on Tash a bit? Maybe he was like the Morgoth to Jadis' Sauron? Okay okay, maybe the answers to some of these questions might be found in the Book of Revelations, but movie audiences will expect this movie to stand on its own legs. In previous Narnia books, if the Christian symbolism flew over your head, its fine, you could still enjoy the story... but not here. Not when the symbolism BECOMES the story. If you don't know Revelations before seeing this film, you're in for a horrible time. The story is just a series of things happening that won't make any sense unless you paid attention in church or read the Bible.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Some Christians themselves might take offense to: the concept that every good deed belongs to Jesus and every evil deed belongs to Satan, even unwittingly. So, a Calormen, that is, a dark-skinned Satanist-Muslim (they're the same thing here) is forgiven by Aslan and accepted into Heaven despite serving Tash/Satan/Allah his whole life, since, despite serving the wrong god, his services to that god were noble. I don't think that's how it works in Christianity, at least the circles I'm familiar with. This is what I was taught as a kid: You have to accept Jesus as your savior BEFORE YOU DIE to go to heaven, and if you don't, it doesn't matter how honorably you behaved or how little you've sinned, you're going to hell because you didn't accept Christ during your mortal lifetime. Good deeds are nice, but acceptance of Christ is a MUST, or all those good deeds don't mean jack. The Calorman in question accepts Aslan alright, AFTER he is dead, already in heaven, and spent a lifetime serving Satanic Allah. Letting this guy into heaven is possibly controversial. Imagine if I worshipped Satan my whole life but gave every penny I earned to the homeless shelter and provided tireless community service to them, am I going to heaven or hell? 

&amp;#x200B;

Adapting this piece of work will not be an easy task. My recommendations: Cut out the train accident, let everyone live, make Susan not an atheist and have her show up with the others. Punish Puzzle for his actions; he knew what he was doing was wrong and did it anyway. Change the name ""Calormen"" to something else and make them racially diverse, including some white dudes, and don't make them Muslim or anything close. Tash=Satan is okay, Tash=Satan=Allah is not okay. Censor the dwarves' racial slurs. Tirian finds some other disguise or strategy that doesn't involve wearing blackface. Explain the stable, Aslan's decision to end the world at this particular time, and Tash a little better. Let that one Calorman into heaven, but skip that whole ""good deeds in another god's service equal good deeds towards me"" thing for the sake of not pissing off the Christian audience. Make the third act more of a coherent story and less of a series of biblical events that happen one after another. Spend more time with Tirian and Jewel in the first act, let's get to know them a little better before throwing them into the plot. Make Tirian a more competent king; that is, don't let the Calormen enslave the animals and capture Caer Paravel without him having a damn clue any of it is coming. Reference the Book of Revelations to explain things if need be, but be subtle about it.... dammit, I really am cutting Lewis' vision to ribbons here... I could understand Peter Jackson cutting out Tom Bombadil, but these cuts and changes are MANY.

How can you discuss the 1940's to now without discussing oil and its how its presence in the Islamic world and the geopolitical consequences of that or Communism or Facism etc. etc. There are overarching not just conflicts but economic forces that permeate. Its tough to discuss Europe and its rise without talking about Catholicism or in some ways even Greco-Roman. Is there fantasy that doesn't ape these forces but does a good job of creating its own.

Only thing I can guess at is *Locke Lamora* came out in an earlier era prior to ""YA"" taking off or even existing en masse and so it bypassed association whereas if released today, it would be categorized as YA. 

The other thing is the length as *Locke Lamora* I believe is a much longer book but that's pretty strange to me that the classification would hinge solely on the length of the books (which is not SUCH a drastic difference to begin with).

945,"Is anyone else ""polyamorous"" with their books?Not like reading different genres, but reading several books at a time.

946,"I found a xianxia with a gay romanceDo you like the Chinese fantasy subgenre of xianxia, popularized around here by Will Wright's Cradle series but bored of one dimensional straight romances?

I found Mo Dao Zu Shi, or [*Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation*](https://exiledrebelsscanlations.com/novels/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation/) by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu.

&gt;As the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect, Wei WuXian roamed the world in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the chaos he created. In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest shidi and killed by powerful clans that combined to overpower him. He incarnates into the body of a lunatic who was abandoned by his clan and is later, unwillingly, taken away by a famous cultivator among the clans—Lan WangJi, his archenemy. This marks the start of a thrilling yet hilarious journey of attacking monsters, solving mysteries, and raising children. From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei WuXian slowly realizes that Lan WangJi, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei WuXian than he is letting on.

It is popular enough in China that it has been adapted as an apparently pretty popular [live-action TV series](https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228), a [manhua](https://exiledrebelsscanlations.com/the-grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation/), an [audio drama](https://www.missevan.com/mdrama/drama/19059#t=0&amp;e=1) and [an animated series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m346FShZ5Dc). The animation in particular won numerous awards.

The story is [heart-breaking but really touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsR5udgSGXY) so if you're tired of the very bland straight relationships that seem to predominate xianxia this is a great break.

Another thing to note is that at only 126 chapters, it is *very* short compared to most mainstream webnovels, which often clock in at something like 15 times that long. It is not a completely happy ending where everyone lives happily ever after, characters die and not everything is magically set right in the end. The villains mostly have decent reasons for what they do. You might not agree with them, but they have explanations for why they want to do whatever. The main characters have flaws, and make mistakes.",1

I finished book one...and just about nothing happened. Like, effectively, nothing at all.

Now, mind you, I don't mind slow books. I don't mind books full of worldbuilding. But something has to happen. Even say, ""Spice and Wolf"", a notoriously slow and worldbuildy book series from Japan has something happening in it.

Book one barely had anything happen though. Like, three things, maybe, can be considered major. He starts on a journey, he fights a duel, and he meets up with a traveling acting troupe. And that's really it. 

There was no conclusion of any sort. There was no lesson learned. There was no ending. The first book simply ended because it ran out of pages.

I WANT to like this, mind you. But really, something has to happen, there should be a payoff of some sort. I felt like book one was a waste.

If the entire fan fervor for this is because it's set in the far future, I'm afraid it's not going to do anything for me, Clark Ashton Smith's ""Zothique"" stories satiate that need far better to me.

When's it get good? If I finish all four is the payoff worthwhile? Are there lessons learned, life altering questions asked, and so forth? Does Gene Wolfe ever stop writing like he's just bought one of those ""Obscure Words a Day"" daily calendars? 

Like I said, I WANT to like it. But if book 2-4 is just basically more of book 1, well, I may put reading it on the backburner somewhere.",1

I will not review it, but I will say first and foremost, it's a portal fantasy, so if you like those, then this is a must read.  But more than just doors to other realities, this is a book about family and the lengths people go to keep that connection.  It's about friendship and found family.  It's about openness to new experiences in a world that wants to control what we see, think and do.  And it's also about power and it's misuse.  I cannot say enough about this book.

952,"Para's Proper Reviews: My foray into Star Wars (Part 5: Rogue One and Solo)*Rogue One* and *Solo* were the last two movies left for me to watch before I dived into the shows and books. I initially intended to watch them much earlier (release order and all), but in the end, it made more sense to leave them for last – both because it made more sense to group them together separately from the sequels and because I wanted to watch *The Rise of Skywalker* as soon as possible to avoid spoilers.

As for the two movies themselves? I find them incredibly intersting to compare. So similar in so many ways, yet one was a riot and the other…not so much.


#Rogue One (2016)
*Rogue One* is one half of a good movie bolted onto one half of a bad movie. And I have no idea what to make of that.

The concept, the story of how the rebels got the Death Star plans, seemed excellent. I heard it was gritty before going in, which should have made it right up my alley. And that there was a sassy droid, which, ditto. I broke my release order rule and saved it for after Solo, thinking (based on their reputations) I should do the best one last, but I really should have stuck to release order.

The main problem of *Rogue One* is that the first half to two thirds of it are *insanely* boring. In a Star Wars movie, this is practically a cardinal sin. And the main reason for that is that literally none of the many(!) characters has anything even remotely resembling a personality. They’re 0.5 dimensional at best. If I had to choose one or two words to describe them, I couldn’t – they’re just chess pieces for the plot to move around. And while the concept is good and it sounds great when you put it in bulletpoints, and there’s plenty of eye candy (the costumes, the settings…the pilot…), the pacing is terrible. I kept pausing it to complain and getting reassurance that yes, it does get good, just wait a while longer. So I waited. And yawned. And took screenshots of pretty scenery to pass the time. &gt;!Anyone else thought Vader pretty much lives in Mordor?!&lt;
  
([These guys](https://otherworldsreviews.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/red-robes.png), for example. I like red robes, okay? &gt;!There was even another 2 second cameo of the proper red guards.!&lt;)
  
Luckily, it did get better. Once shit finally started getting real and the pacing picked up, it was one hell of a ride. But it was mostly saved by finally developing a plot, not because the characters improved. I can’t help but wonder how good it could have been if we were able to form an emotional attachment to the characters in the first half. How much harder would some of the emotional moments hit? How much better would it be if I didn’t spend an hour and a half yawning and waiting for it to get good? It’s so close to being a genuinely great movie, potentially the best of the bunch, that its flaws are all the more infuriating.

Disappointing.

#Solo (2018)
I went into *Solo* very cautiously. Han Solo was one of my least favourite characters in the original trilogy and besides, it’s a known flop.

After watching it, I have to say it doesn’t deserve half the shit it gets because it was fucking *delightful*. I was grinning nearly the whole way through and it left me absolutely pumped. It’s a fast-paced bundle of fun, and actors being different did not bother me much at all. In short, the complete opposite of *Rogue One*.

The thing I loved the most is that, exactly like *The Mandalorian*, *Solo* shows us the gritty underside of the Empire we don’t get to see in the main series. There are no Jedi, or big damn heroes this time around, it’s more morally gray and focused on people with no special destiny. Very much up my alley. My favourite example of this is the ~~airport~~ spaceport scene near the beginning. The background detail and the atmosphere it creates are astonishing – the PA announcements, Imperial propaganda, casual Stormtrooper brutality, the grime, the long waitlines. And there are many more scenes like it. &gt;!Trench warfare, terrible conditions on mining planets...not the kind of stuff I expected to see in Star Wars, but hey.!&lt; Instead of just telling us that the Empire is evil, it makes some effort to *show* us why, more effectively than any of the main movies did. Even in an unabashedly popcorn movie, this is more than welcome.

And then there are all the other goodies that make it as wonderfully entertaining as it is. Spaceships! Criminals! The galaxy’s filthy underworld! Fun twists! It might be grittier than the main series, but it’s no less fun. And unlike in *Rogue One*, the characters had some actual…well, character. Even the mandatory sassy droid was more fun.

Of course it’s not perfect. Some actors’ delivery of lines is *incredibly* awkward at points, for one. And I wasn’t a fan of how L3 was handled at all either – without going into spoilers, they did her so dirty. Qi’ra confused me. But all in all, none of the flaws was enough to torpedo me out of the story. It had more pros than cons. *It made sense.*

#Verdict
The end impression is bittersweet.

They’re both fairly similar in some ways – both of them attempt to show a grittier, somewhat more morally gray side of the galaxy compared to the relatively straightforward dark side vs. light side conflict of the main series. Both focus almost entirely on non-Jedi. Both are standalone. Both are flawed.

But *Solo* worked for me enough to put it in the second tier with *The Force Awakens* and most of the original trilogy - and *Rogue One* didn’t, not really. There are two things I watch Star Wars for: the pew pews, and the fun characters (and the worldbuilding, but that’s a given in any movie), and the former is only fun when the latter’s there. Action is meaningless without emotional connection. It’s a similar problem as I had with *The Rise of the Skywalker*, except that was a mess beyond any hope of salvation and *Rogue One* comes frustratingly close to being excellent.

Since I’m done with the movies, this is probably the last post in this series. It’s been one hell of a ride – from someone who has stubbornly avoided them and only reluctantly started watching because of an adorable baby alien, to a massive fan who practically won’t shut up. I apologise to everyone waiting for book reviews and generally more diverse kinds of content while I’m getting Star Wars out of my system – which may as well take months. If nothing else, it pulled me out of a really bad depressive funk and for that I will always be grateful 😄

Now, onto *Clone Wars*, *Rebels*, and the books!

*More reviews on my blog, [To Other Worlds](https://otherworldsreviews.wordpress.com).*",1
953,"Goodreads Librarians are deleting ongoing web serials with 100s of reviewsLike many people, I enjoy a good web serial. I think they're a great addition to the literary world and while they often have an air of uncertainty about being dropped, I enjoy them. Serials are, of course, nothing new. Many famous authors got their start writing serial works.

Unfortunately, the librarians at Goodreads feel that ongoing web serials are not books. And that, subsequently, they do not belong on the site. I could find nowhere in the librarian rules that this is an invalid format for Goodreads and have received no word as to the justification.

I just wanted to let people know because this feels like an injustice to readers. As it is the readers that are hurt most by this. Goodreads is first and foremost a social media platform for readers. It's a shame that this is happening.

**Full Disclosure:** This all came about because I was attempting to add my serial to Goodreads. As so many have done before me. Seeing that no rule stated web serials were not allowed, I thought it was fine. 

When I contacted the librarians to add a URL to my book like how Worm and many others have it, my listing was deleted and the reason given was that ongoing web serials are not considered valid on Goodreads.

I thought this was a category error and I should have listed it as a serial or something else more appropriate. I linked two very popular serials pointing out that they are on the site and if I have the wrong category to point me in the right direction.

The librarian stated that they can't be held responsible for people posting books, but that they will remove them as soon as they notice them if they are in violation. 

My use of popular and well-established titles was to help legitimize and show that there is indeed a precedent, serials should be allowed, and that there are no rules against their inclusion evidenced by several titles being up for years.

What happened was the librarian deleted the two linked books. These are the books deleted:

 [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36013957-the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36013957-the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound) 

 [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081167-mother-of-learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081167-mother-of-learning) 

As you can see, both are now gone. I sincerely apologize for any damage done. It was in no way, shape, or form, my intention to see harm to another author's hard work. I was attempting to use such high-profile titles as a means of strengthening the case for the inclusion of web serials.

This isn't how the system should work.",1
954,"Question about Audible vs Kindle (Whispersync)Trying to wrap my head around Kindle pairing with audible.  I have an audible subscription, but I read far more than 12 books a year so I often end up buying books additional.  I tend to read it first, then if I want a second read I will listen to the narration.  Some books I like to read and listen to, such a wheel of time, because the narration is phenomenal.  

&amp;#x200B;

The question...If I go to audible, and look at Eye of the World (Wheel of Time book 1) it costs $41.97.  The kindle website has the written book listed as $10.99, and you can pay $7.49 for whispersync with voice bringing the total to $18.48.  Is whispersync not the same narration (Michael Kramer/Kate Reading) or something? 

&amp;#x200B;

I already own physical copies of the WoT series, but unless I am missing something it looks like Audible is cool if you use your credits, but otherwise you are paying 3x as much for the the narration compared to kindle where you get both the narration and a digital book.",1
955,"Memory Thieves – an emerging subgenre of fantasyFantasy is now so extensive a genre, you could go years without reading another in the same subcategory. That’s why it seems strange when two books with a similar idea are published at the same time, but it can also be incredibly exciting when you realise that an entirely new subgenre is beginning to emerge, one that you were there to witness the birth of.

We’re at that frontier now with the ‘memory thief’ subgenre, where people can steal memories from others, leaving their victim bereft of experiences, emotions and even their identity. In the process, the thief gains a wealth of knowledge, which they can use or disregard as they please. This new type of magic system is a fascinating foray into the unknown, but it rivals real world issues we increasingly face.

The rise of the subgenre may be linked to a growing awareness of mental health, but although the theme of identity is nothing new, what is arguably more interesting is how the authors at the forefront of this subgenre explore the frontier in very different ways. To fully understand what I mean, you’ll have to read Incendiary by Zoraida Cordova and Last Memoria by Rachel Emma Shaw. Both are fantastic books in their own rights (definitely worth a read!), but it’s only by reading the two together that you get an insight into how one idea can vary so much in how an author tells it.

An idea alone means nothing, it’s the author’s experiences, interests and attitude to life that create the story. This becomes very apparent with Incendiary and Last Memoria. They explore different aspects of memory thieving: consequences of memory loss, imbalance of power, how mistrust and suspicion can replace trust and affection, but do so in a way that creates different tones to the worlds.

Take Incendiary, the more YA of the two. The book introduces us to our memory thieving protagonist, Ren, in a way that implies a hopefulness for her adventures to come.

*“I am Renata Convida. I have lived a hundred stolen lives. Now I live my own.”*

She’s on a mission to rescue her people from the kingdom that hates them. This is a character who has faced much, yet still has a youthful determination to make the most of life.

Then we have Last Memoria, a much grittier, more adult and potentially realistic take on memory stealing. Here we see the strain put on the thief’s relationships with others and themselves.

*“Sarilla had learnt one thing from stealing memories. Everybody lies.”*

This more brutalist outlook results in a protagonist who cannot be good, but who sees herself as no less of a monster than those she stole from.

Despite all the differences between the books, there are interesting ways the authors are aligned. Both do an impressive job of worldbuilding and both explore the consequences of hatred for memory thieves. In Last Memoria, Sarilla is forced to steal by a king who recognises the power she can bring him, and she’s despised for it. The same is somewhat true for Ren and her kind in Incendiary, but with different consequences.

Both authors have recognised the importance of memories, then based this at the heart of their stories, particularly in the case of Last Memoria, where the memory stealing is used to great effect in several unexpected ways. Though I’ll say no more since I don’t want to ruin it for you.

Incendiary and Last Memoria are due for release in the spring and I highly recommend you add both books to your to-read list. If you do, you’ll get two heartbreakingly beautiful stories that will leave you reeling and so glad you discovered this new subgenre.

Thanks for reading my review",1
956,"The Night Angel Trilogy: are they good books, or just angsty pulp?I'm looking for my next thing to read, and thought about giving these books a try, but I have reservations. I've seen people say they like them, and I know they were pretty successful, but I see a plot about assassins, slums, and a Black Dragon Guild and wonder ""is this just going to be an angsty, grimdark power fantasy?"" Are they actually good books, or more in the realm of pulpy adventure? I'm down with the grimdark thing if they're smartly written with good characters, but not if it's just lazy badassery.

Mind you, I have no grudge against pulpy angst-porn -- I probably would have loved that 20 years ago. Nowadays, it's not my thing. For some reference: I usually steer more toward stuff like the Broken Earth trilogy, the Magicians trilogy, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, Neil Gaiman's stuff, just finished the Winternight books, stuff like that, but wouldn't mind a decent action-oriented series as a change of pace. I'm down with stuff like SoI&amp;F, really didn't like the Mistborn books, and was lukewarm on The First Law trilogy (didn't love it, but I do think it's well-written).

I looked at The Powder Mage Trilogy as well, but got the impression the Night Angel books were better received.",1
957,"Review: Onslaught of Madness by Jesse TellerWow. What a story. Intense, dark and brooding. Grittiness turned up to the max. This is the second novel I’ve read from Jesse Teller and he definitely has a style that skilfully sucks the reader into his intricately imagined world and shows them no mercy once they’re there. ​

I was swept up in the distinctive multiple narratives, compelled to keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. I quickly realised my enjoyment of this novel heightened when I read in long gulps of a couple of hours or so at a time, rather than in little sips, to get the full immersive experience. 
 
The story follows the invasion of the country of Tienne by the brutal country of Drine. Drine culture is essentially a war factory, with children taught to fight and kill from the time they can toddle. Women are baby makers from the moment they can bear children and slaves are captured to become more soldiers or mothers. They follow the god of destruction, Dis. Dis wants Tienne and sends his trusted warlord, Rextur Cherlot, otherwise known as the Madness of Drine, to crush it. 
 
Rextur seems unstoppable, carrying the Scythe of Dis and riding on Dis’ great bull. But mighty Rextur's grand invasion plans come unstuck as the country of Tienne proves not to be such an easy target. Unlikely heroes step up to fight back, other Gods grant followers great powers and skilled swordsmen unite.
 
To maintain his power, Rextur captures his foe. But instead of making things better for him, they make them much, much worse. Moons shatter, cities crumble and blood is shed. For all his strength and divine magic, the Madness of Drine falters…
 
The story is also told from the point of views of those who are fighting back against Rextur. There’s Aaron the Marked, who follows his magical King Chief along with another, who have come down from the mountains to resist. The trio are all boys, although where they’re from, they are men. They’re skilled fighters and strategists. Bent on following his King’s orders, Aaron has to deal with the pesky annoyance of his dead father’s voice in his head telling him otherwise. 
 
Tera is a young woman who is chosen by her god, the god of children, to find the new ‘Perpetual Child’ and save the Tienne children captured by Drine from being taken back to feed Drine’s war machine. For company and guidance, she has a magical wooden horse who speaks, and joins forces with a ‘pack’ of human/animals who follow another god, the Mother of Nature, but who also want to stop Rextur.
 
Vianne is a witch of high status who is forced into protecting her betrothed’s city after her own is invaded. She has troubles with her drunk brother and his scheming friend. There’s also Sai the swordsmen, and a treacherous mage, Arundis. 
 
There’s plenty of action, deep worldbuilding and the writing is evocative with powerful imagery. I particularly liked this line: “The streets filled quickly with soldiers as Drine’s sons tore into the city of Eleacont like fangs into tender meat.” SO RAW!
 
This book took a few chapters to get into, to really get under the skin of each of the narrative characters, but once I was firmly ensconced there, it was an emotional, fast-paced ride. Also, one of the character’s narratives abruptly ends and is replaced by that of their murderer. I was hoping that the character would reappear in a kind of “Ta da, magic, I’m baaaaack!” way, but unfortunately not, and they were shaping up to be my favourite.
 
Onslaught of Madness is a grimdark fantasy that will appeal to those who love carefully created worlds with multi-layered histories, a large cast of complex characters, stories told from multiple POVs and bloody, unrelenting action. 
 
My rating: 4.5/5",1
958,"Fantasy stories with big technological gapLooking for fantasy stories with big technological gap in any medium. Something like guns vs swords and magic, industrialization in fantasy world, civilization with very advanced magic etc.. I'm craving for it.

I've only read/watched asian fantasies but I'm also looking for western fantasy stories in any medium except games. I'm kinda getting tired Japanese isekais now.

Things I've read/watched with technological gap:

GATE: Thus the JSDF fought (JP) – Gate to a medieval fantasy world opened in Japan. Japan Self Defense Force fought empires, kingdom alliance, dragons, demigods, monsters using modern weapons. Lots of Japanese patriotism.

Release that Witch (CN) – MC, an industrial engineer from modern world, transmigrated as a 4th prince of a kingdom in a medieval fantasy world where witches are being hunted by the religion and kingdoms. He starts an industrial revolution using witches' power. Lots of political schemes and conspiracies.

The Book Eating Magician (KR) – There's two superpower countries that have been fighting each other for hundreds of years. One is the most technologically advanced kingdom which is the MC's country and the other is one is an empire with best swordsmen which are basically anti-mages. Their wars are like US vs Soviet back in the cold wars.

The Starship Officer Becomes An Adventurer (JP) – Sci-Fi soldier's starship crashes in a sword and magic fantasy world. He starts adventuring this world with his sci-fi weapons.

Manuke FPS (JP) - Virtual Reality FPS player falls into an out of bounds place in the game and got transported in a sword and magic fantasy world.

959,"Insufficiently Whiny ProtagonistsA lot of people complain about excessively whiny protagonists.  I have the opposite problems.  A lot of Fantasy with literary pretentions will have a character experience things they consider unjust, then the story will whack them upsides the head and show them their parent/mentor had reasons and should be forgiven.  The problem is, they often dial things up to 11 to the point it reads as abuse to me. to the point that ""forgiving"" the parental figure feels like Stocklholm Syndrome or Authorial Gaslighting to me.

Something similar happens in ""Pride &amp; Prejudice"" or ""Alphahole"" romances.  Often the protagonist will start out angry for totally justified reasons then end up forgiving the love interest for something I see as unforgiveable.

Anyone else notice this phenomenon?  Can you think of books where the protagonist forgave the unforgiveable?  Where a straight out case of child abuse was treated as something the hero would understand when he got older?",1

He makes all the decisions either because she doesn't care to get involved in any decision making or because she's afraid to confront him. After all the bad things that happened to her in the first book (she seemed to spend a lot of time sleeping), she still isn't especially motivated to take control of her power or life. She's just along for the ride doing whatever Matthew feels is best. Overall I'm enjoying the series but she just seems like a very weak character.",1

First, a couple of DNFs:  


**Breath of Earth** by Beto Cato

I was warned that I might not like it, and yeah, I struggled to get into this before finally deleting it. Any US history - including alt history - has a massive hill to climb with me, and American-setting steampunk has a massive hill to climb with me. So...combining those two and, well, I'm definitely not the target reader for this. Not sure when I bought this or why; I've liked some of Beth's short stories in the past, so it might have been a whim or there was a sale. 

**Downbelow Station** by CJ Cherryh

Yes, this was a DNF. No, I have no idea why not. Yes, I understand that I've never DNF a Cherryh book before. No, I have actually read another book in this series and liked it. But after 50 pages, I. was. bored. And, no, it wasn't that I didn't know what was going on because I've read Merchanter's Luck. And, no, it wasn't her style. I've read the entire Foreigner series. I just...bounced...hard. So that was disappointing because I remember this ebook costing a small fortune. But alas. 

Stuff I finished:

**The Magpie Lord** and **Interlude with Tattoos** by KJ Charles

If it wasn't for the sex scene (singular), I'd have planned to read this entire series. That's how much I hated the sex scene. But, I thought well maybe it was just that one, and went ahead with the short story that happens right after this book, and ho boi no, I really hate these sex scenes. And, since the sex scene submission language was showing up randomly in the short story, I decided that I wouldn't even be able to just skip the sex scenes later on. I loathe reading this kind of ""kink"", for lack of a better way to describe it. I'm rather disappointed, honestly, because the writing and story itself was excellent. 

**The Adventures of Myhr** by PN Elrod

A fun story for when you need a shorter, laid-back book that's standalone. The middle sagged a little for me, but not enough to stop reading (I think this was mostly due to the length; this would have been a perfect book if it was about 75 pages shorter, but it's a trad book from 2003; it was going to be 350-400 pages no matter what the story actually needed). Basic plot is two dudes were portal jumping around the universe, accidentally ended up in the wrong place, shit was going down, they couldn't jump out, they got involved with the shit, and then there was a few accidentally trips to hell in the process. 

**What else is on the Kobo?** 

Well, hundreds of books. Here's some titles I'm picking from next. Feel free to share thoughts on it you think I'll like them or not.

963,"Review of Moxyland by Lauren Beukes**Prelude.** I bounced off of **The Shining Girls** hard a year and a half ago, but I needed a cyberpunk novel, this was mentioned, and after squinting at my bookshelf, it turned out I already had it.... So, following u/KristaDBall's footsteps, this is also a ""read what you already own"" review.

**Book.** Lauren Beukes, **Moxyland**.

**Bingo Squares**: (a) Slice of Life/small scale (argument *could* be made for slice of life), (b) local author (South Africa), (c) Cyberpunk, (d) Afrofuturism.

**Bingo square I am using it for:** Cyberpunk.

**Plot:** We are in near-future Capetown, where cops control genetically altered dogs and can electrocute you through your phone. We walk its public and corporate spaces through the first-person POVs of four people. Kendra is an art school dropout who just got ""sponsored"" by a mega-corp to become a walking soft drink advertisement and addict in exchange for healing nanobots and fame.  Toby is running a real-time podcast of his life, which occasionally involves all sorts of illegal activities. Tendeka runs various charity projects and organizes anti-government protest actions on the side (which Toby films and broadcasts) on behalf of some mysterious entity called skyward* (take *that*, Brandon Sanderson).  Lerato is computer prodigy working for a BIG CORPORATION, who is hacking things on the side.  One day Toby spots Kendra's glowing soft drink tattoo, and makes Lerato help Tendeka screw with corporate advertising boards on the highway, and things quickly go downhill from there.

**Thoughts:** quick fast-paced read - very much *unlike* **The Shining Girls**, which I started dreading once I realized where things were going.  Unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately - it falls into the category of books that perhaps were written as a cautionary tale, but are essentially becoming less and less science fiction and more and more documentaries with every day.  We are not at the same level of genetic engineering, but there are countries in the world that are exactly that the same level of policing, and there are corporations in the world that are exactly at the same level of &gt;!creating false flag operations!&lt; when it suits their needs.  And it is seriously depressing.

Also, without commenting on the plot points that make me say so, Tendeka is a tool who got played by such an obvious set-up.  Although, come to think of it, the novel really is about how every protagonist is essentially a naive tool of those who know which buttons to push, with only the least likely of them retaining any semblance of free will at the end.

**Content warnings** Not much. Sex scenes are sort of sexless.  Everyone is doing drugs - this seems to be a thing with near future dystopias in general.  Lots of bodily fluids at the end of the book, so if reading about constant vomiting is not your thing, watch out.  But really, nothing major.

**Who will like it:** Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross fans.  In various ways, **Moxyland** is an anti-thesis to **Little Brother**. Both probably should be read in quick succession, with **Little Brother** being second in order to restore one's faith in humanity.

**Who will not like it:**  Two groups of people, I think. First, those who do not like idiot ball. Because Tendeka turns out to be all about it in the most sincere way possible.  Second - anarchists, and any other supporters of indiscriminate violence as a response to totalitarian regimes. Because the point of the book is that **these people** are the most likely ones to be played. And if you are sincere in your beliefs, you probably won't like it as the book's core message

**Rating**: **C-list** fair and square.  Solid, if depressing book, but nothing in it that aggressively stands out above the fray.

964,"I am Sever Bronny, author of The Arinthian Line series and Fury of a Rising Dragon series - AMA!Hiyas!

I'm the r/fantasy Writer of the Day, here to answer all your questions regarding my work.

I've been a full-time author for over four years and write coming-of-age fantasy that can be read by all ages. I've published 1.48 million words spread over eight books (two series), all having to do with the same three characters (a teenage boy and two girls: Augum, Bridget and Leera). I write from a single point of view (Augum's) and painstakingly complete about one book a year. My latest book, *Mercy's Trial (Fury of a Rising Dragon, book 3)*, took over a year and a half to complete and launched in December.

I started reading fantasy at a young age, beginning with the Dragonlance saga, and continuing on with the usual favorites (LOTR, etc). I role-played a lot (Rifts, Palladium, AD&amp;D, Gurps, Vampire, among others), and was an avid gamer, particularly getting caught up in the Diablo universe. Nowadays I relax by playing games like BOTW and Skyrim. I love reading and movies (I regularly re-watch Bladerunner, Star Wars, Highlander, Aliens, Limitless, Edge of Tomorrow, Interstellar, Lost in Translation, and Margin Call. Must have seen Bladerunner nearly a hundred times). My absolute favorite books to read, besides fantasy, are non-fiction true-lie survival tales (stuff like Krakauer's *Into Thin Air*, Kurson's *Shadow Divers*, and Junger's *Perfect Storm*).

I started writing fantasy after about my fourth or fifth read-through of Harry Potter, at which point I was so desperate to read a story that made me *feel* the way HP had made me feel—that sheer excitement and sense of friendship and adventure and mystery—that I simply started writing one. 

I never looked back.

I'm also a failed musician who has been given a second chance at a creative profession (backstory to that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5ot1tm/four_years_five_books_867000_words_its_not_every/dcltws6/)), and am extremely grateful to be writing for my day job in a notoriously fickle industry. On average, I write about 2000+ words a day and love every minute of it (well, most of the time). I cannot thank my readers enough for supporting my work.

**What critics say about my work:** The early stuff is overly simple, youngish, and derivative. Some are repulsed by the occasional teenage drama, others can't stand the political biases which I've occasionally allowed to bleed into the work.

**What fans say about my work:** That I've developed my own unique magic system, that my characters are lovable and evolve over time, that they love my worldbuilding, and that they've enjoyed seeing my progression as an author. They compare my work to a mix of Harry Potter/The Hobbit/Eragon, though say it has quickly evolved into its own unique thing. Oh and some readers have labeled my work ""Progression Fantasy,"" which is interesting, but I believe relevant.

[Here's an overly staged photo of me](https://i.imgur.com/upPlnbU.jpg) for this AMA.

A quick rundown of my work:

965,"Elric Series Audiobooks?This is not the first time this has been brought up over the years. 2 exist (EoM, SotSoF, #1,#2)  but essentially unobtainable.

I am so desperate to get the WHOLE series on audiobook. My eyesight has degenerated and I rely on audio to enjoy the books I love and pass the time. These particular books, I grew up with and have heavily internalized, and it tortures me I cannot enjoy them.

I tried TTS, but even Googles new tech just cannot do dramatic reading.

Is there some motivated fan (preferably British) who would consider narrating these books, ala Gareth Armstrong, WH40k books, and sharing? If I had the money I would pay a pro, maybe a crowd fund? Is there anyone out there as frustrated as I am? What should I do?

In particular:

 Elric of Menibone

The Sailor on the Seas of Fate

The Weird of the White Wolf

The Bane of the Black Sword

Stormbringer

The Fortress of the Pearl

967,"Future teacher trying to track down the title and author of a fantasy short story that I loved - does this plot sound familiar?My google-fu isn't working for me, so I thought I'd de-lurk and ask for help. This is a long shot, but I'm crossing my fingers. 

Several years ago I read a short story in a fantasy collection that I thought was particularly haunting - I remember looking up other works by the same author because I was so impressed. Unfortunately, my menopausal brain has not been helpful in bringing the author and title back to mind now. 

The short story was set *after* your typical high fantasy series, where a queen fights in the night, year after year, to save her husband the king from his nightmares and hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. The basic premise is that he did the typical heroic things we read about in epic fantasy, but she is a quiet hero of a different kind, who saves him again and again from the fallout  of battling the Big Evil. 

It was a beautiful story that has stayed with me for years and I'd like to track it down again. I'm about to start my last practicum before becoming a high school English teacher and this would be a great story to include in the short story unit. 

On a side note: I'm dismayed to discover how little has changed in terms of resources since I was in high school myself. Don't get me wrong, I love Edgar Allan Poe and Ray Bradbury and Shirley Jackson, but it's like the short story textbooks are stuck in a time warp.",1
968,"Progression Fantasy Super-Sale!If you're not familiar with it yet, progression fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that follows characters as they develop in power and skill over time. It's obviously been around for quite a while, but was only recently named and taxonomized by the amazing Andrew Rowe, author of Arcane Ascension. There's a massive range of variance in the subgenre- works as diverse as Dragon Ball Z, Tamora Pierce's Protector of the Small, and Jim Butcher's Codex Alera could all be considered progression fantasy.

I have heard it semi-jokingly referred to as stories for people who have an unusual love of training montages, and, well... hard to argue with that one.

A few of us self-identified progression fantasy authors decided to run a progression fantasy sale starting today, so, without further ado:

* Andrew Rowe's [Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3): Years ago, Corin Cadence's brother ventured into the Serpent Spire Trials to earn an attunement to grant him magical power. He never came back. Now it's Corin's turn, and he's going to do whatever it takes to find his brother. If you like wizard schools, complex hard magic systems, dungeon crawls, and lots of JRPG-influences, Sufficiently Advanced Magic is most definitely up your alley. (And, for those of us who love enchanting and magitech, oh do we get so much of that.) [UK Sale Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)
* Will Wight's [House of Blades (Traveler's Gate Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D52X58Y?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks): When Simon's village is destroyed, a prophecy foretells that a hero will arise among the survivors to save the realm. The only problem is that the hero in question isn't Simon. That's not going to stop him from trying to save his fellow villagers anyways. If you like hard magic systems with unusual costs and dangerous temptations, fast paced action, and gratuitously huge swords, you should give House of Blades a look. (And, because Will Wight's just cooler than the rest of us, this one's free! Will's also the author of the amazing Cradle series.)
* Sarah Lin's [Street Cultivation](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Cultivation-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B07W9J75R3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) and [Changing Faces (NGM Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KMMT9TX?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks): Rick is an employee of a strip mall training dojo, just trying to make enough money to get by and take care of his sister. Unfortunately, when he's caught up in an underground fighting tournament, he finds himself in well over his head. Street Cultivation is one of my favorite takes on the xianxia-inspired cultivation genre. Like Cradle, it has a martial arts magic system that literally everyone in the world has access to. Street Cultivation, however, takes that into the urban fantasy realm, where predatory debt, lawyers, and gentrification are as bigger threats than demons or rogue martial artists. (The demons, after all, have some very nice offices downtown, and are quite the respectable businessmen these days.) Changing Faces is the first book of Sarah Lin's New Game Minus LitRPG series. The dread necromancer Bloodwraith, on the edge of defeat, trades bodies with the adventurer that defeated him. He suddenly finds himself trapped in a brutish warrior's body, confronting the revelation that mysterious alien gods have been manipulating his world for their own strange purposes. Worse, there are mysterious floating boxes full of text constantly obscuring his vision. If you're a fan of emotionally well-developed characters and masterful trope subversions, you should give Sarah Lin a read!

Another cultivation series like Street Cultivation or Cradle, A Thousand Li stands out for its heavy grounding in Medieval Chinese history and culture. There are even footnotes explaining various Chinese concepts and references, which I absolutely adore. (Terry Pratchett trained me to love footnotes in fiction, what can I say? Footnotes make everything better.) Great for fans of Wuxia (Legend of the Condor Heroes; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and fans of slice-of-life fantasy. [UK Sale Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07PKGSDDQ/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_1)
* Last and least (seriously, read the others first, they're all so much fun), we've got my own Mage Errant series. [Into the Labyrinth (Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J675X2C?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&amp;storeType=ebooks) and [Jewel of the Endless Erg (Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJDV4JJ?notRedirectToSDP=1&amp;ref_=dbs_mng_calw_1&amp;storeType=ebooks) are on sale now. Hugh of Emblin is, as far as he's concerned, the worst mage at the Academy of Skyhold, and would be entirely happy avoiding everyone's attention. Anonymity, however, isn't in the cards for Hugh, and he quickly finds himself caught up in situations beyond his control after a mysterious mage chooses him as an apprentice. If you're a fan of excessively convoluted hard magic systems, Machiavellian political intrigue, giant monsters, and emotional trainwreck protagonists, you might... not hate Mage Errant. (That's about as nice as my impostor syndrome is feeling towards me today.)

970,"Review and unqualified recommendation: Sleepless DomainIt just occurred to me that I haven't seen any mention of [Sleepless Domain](http://www.sleeplessdomain.com/comic/chapter-1-cover) on this subreddit and a quick search finds nothing, so allow me to rectify that with a review of this fantastic webcomic. 

Sleepless Domain is a magical girl webcomic set in a city where monsters attack every night like clockwork. There is no masquerade here, magical girls are an institution. They have government support, school hours start late so they can sleep in after battling monsters, there are databses of costumes and magical symbols to help magical girls quickly find their destined team; and there's also big money for the aspiring magical girl in adverts and celebrity endorsements. In short the entire culture has accepted and normalised the idea that pre-teen girls are the city's entire military force. 

Despite that this is not another Madoka like deconstruction of the magical girl genre. The book never shies away from the implications of putting the responsibility of fighting monsters onto young girls - even if the citizens take it for granted - but the focus is on why these girls fight and the emotional strength and resilience they demonstrate in doing so. They are never portrayed as wrong for wanting to fight, and they're never portrayed as wrong if they don't want to fight either.

That strength and resilience is probably the comic's best selling point. The main characters are wonderful three dimensional characters and it's an absolute joy to read about their friendship, how they give each other emotional support, and help each other be the very best they can be. Though on a personal level I'm also very keen on the slow burn (perhaps too slow burn) mystery connected to the origins of magical girls and the city they live in.",1
971,"Book Review: Strange Grace by Tessa Gratton 

### Summary:

*Long ago, a village made a bargain  with the devil: to ensure their prosperity, when the Slaughter Moon  rises, the village must sacrifice a young man into the depths of the  Devil’s Forest.*

*Only this year, the Slaughter Moon has risen early.*

*Bound by duty, secrets, and the love  they share for one another, Mairwen, a spirited witch; Rhun, the  expected saint; and Arthur, a restless outcast, will each have a role to  play as the devil demands a body to fill the bargain. But the devil  these friends find is not the one they expect, and the lies they uncover  will turn their town—and their hearts—inside out.*

[**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32824058-strange-grace)

### Thoughts:

Here we go with my usual refrain of ‘this  was such a weird book and I totally loved it’. I loved the characters,  the writing style was my type of thing, and there was weird stuff  happening which I can almost always get behind.

This is sort of a dark fantasy about a  village where everyone is healthy and the crops never fail due to a deal  made with ‘the devil’, a strange creature that inhabits the surrounding  woods, many generations ago. Every seven years a young man from the  village will be selected as the sacrifice, or what they call ‘the  saint’, to be taken by ‘the devil’ and fulfill the agreement. ‘The  saint’ is the best of their generation, chosen because they are good  person, which makes sense as far as sacrifices go. No one really knows  what happens to those saints, except every once in a while one will live  through the night and return to the village. No one really knows why  some come back and some don’t but being ‘the saint’ is generally  considered to be a death sentence. So now we come to present day. It’s  not yet time for another saint, the seven years aren’t up, but suddenly  people are getting sick, there is blight on the crops, people start  panicking and decide that they need to offer up another saint now,  before things get worse. And that’s where our story begins.

There’s something very fae and old magic  about this story. It’s like a fairy tale but the original  pre-bowlderized kind that are dark and full of weird creatures who like  to make dangerous bargains. There is a lore here about the village and  why this pact came to be but it’s been so long (a couple of hundred  years, maybe?) and the story has shifted over time and some parts have  either been forgotten or deliberately obscured. Our characters, all  having to play a part in this ritual, are desperate to find out the  truth and if there’s a way out of the pact or a way to preserve it  without one of them disappearing forever. So there’s a lot of mystery  going on and the way that mystery is uncovered is interesting in the  story because it’s interwoven with other things that are going on.

Nothing in this is straight forward. It’s  dark and twisted and someone described it to me as a fever dream and I  think that fits perfectly well. It’s like there’s a haze at times you’re  trying to see through but you can only see some things even though you  know there’s more out there. This is mainly due to the style of prose  where very limited information is imparted to the reader leaving us with  a lot of blanks to fill in. This happens to be one of my favorite  techniques when it is done well and I think it works out here for the  most part although maybe there were a couple of instances where it could  have been done a little bit better. The style of storytelling was a  huge plus for me with this one because it creates such a wonderful  atmosphere–gothic like in a earthy way.

Our three main characters were fantastic.  First we have Mairwen, who is going to be inheriting her mother’s  position as the village grace witch, a position going back to before the  original bargain was made. Some people fear her strangeness but her and  her mother’s place in the village is respected nonetheless. Then you  have Arthur, who was raised as a girl for the first eight or ten years  of his life because his mother was afraid of losing him as a saint. He’s  angry a lot and has a ton of issues and hang ups because of his  upbringing and his parents in general. He is someone that needs a lot of  love, starting with self-love. Last but not least is Rune. He’s the  perfect boy, the obvious saint. He’s nice and helpful and everyone loves  him. The three of them have been friends since children and they have a  complicated history. I don’t want to go into too much because I don’t  want to spoil the story but there is a lot of angst involved in all  their relationships with one another, a lot of want and need and love in  the face of ‘probably shouldn’t’ and ‘this isn’t a good idea’ and the  ever present ‘what will people say’. One of the most satisfying things  about the book was the way their relationship plays out over the course  of the story.

The other thing that is interesting about  this book is the scale of the story. It’s got huge stakes for the folks  involved, and even for the entire village, but it’s definitely on the  smaller scale of things where fantasy is concerned. I really appreciated  that this wasn’t another huge epic fantasy, because I like more  personal stories! Also, the entire book takes place over a pretty short  period of time (a few days I think, maybe a week). Yet I was never  bored, there are plenty of things at play here with the strands of  different narratives woven together as they are.

Overall, I really loved this one. In the  end I wished that it had gone on a bit longer because I wish I could  spend more time with these characters in the aftermath of everything  that happened. I don’t suppose that’s a flaw though, only a ‘me’ thing  of wanting more. **4/5 stars.**",1
972,"Suggestions for First-Person Narrators?I really appreciate how easy it is to follow along in stories that are told from the first-person perspective. If I'm driving and have the audio book going, it's simple enough to get back on the rails if my mind starts to wander when the main character is doing the narration.

I've finished Dresden Files, Alex Verus and Iron Druid (among many other non-FPN books). I loved them, and am open to most any fantasy/sci-fi that's as easy to listen to.",1

974,"Which books/series had an excellent premise but did not deliver on the execution of the story?I recently finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman and it left me a little cold. I was so hyped for it - I love the Sandman graphic novels and the premise of international gods escaping to America sounded so cool. But the actual narrative was kind of dull and underwhelming. Gaiman's writing is excellent but the plot never really picked up and the characters, especially Shadow, were fairly uninteresting.

And the story's different, the plot's different, but that's almost all of what's different. This sounds like a very one-dimensional approach to fantasy, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at.

978,"Why is Fantasy Obsessed With Multi-Volume Series?What up Fantasy gang...so I used to be a huge fantasy aficionado but fell off. 

Tried to get back into it a few years ago and was dismayed to see that all I found was series. “Book 3 of 7”, “Book 5 of 11”, “First book of an exciting new series!!” Etc etc 

Tried to pick up The Lies Of Locke Lamora on the recommendation of a friend and saw that not only was it part of an unfinished series but that the had been no further volumes since 2012!!! I was like no thanks. 

Tried to pick up Stormlight Archive due to its strong reviews...and of course...Book one of TEN! AND it takes 3-4 years for each volume to come out. So I guess I’ll finish the story sometime in 2038. 

After a few months of encountering nothing but series I gave up and turned to sci fi where I found tons of stand alone novels and finished series. 

What is with high fantasy and this obsession with multiple volumes? I literally can’t think of any other genre where the default is 9-10 volume series stretched out over 17-20 years. 

Anyone else dismayed at the fact that they can’t just read a high fantasy novel and move on instead of committing to the next 3-4 years to one series?",1
979,"You should probably play: Paper Mario and the Thousand Year DoorOkay hear me out.

When I was a kid, I didn't read Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit. I didn't play D&amp;D (though I knew what it was, vaguely). I didn't really have much of conception for goblins, elves, and all that. Oblivion had come out, and my brother played it, but all I remember of watching him play was him fighting ghosts in it.

No harry potter, no animorphs, just some goosebumps and other simple kid's books, y'know? But... I had a gamecube, and I sure as hell knew what mario was.

Enter the best game of the 2000's, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door.

It didn't set in me expectations of a genre of fantasy as something like Tolkien's work would do, no. It didn't tell me what elves had to be, what hobbits were, it didn't explain to me epic histories and lore and the kind of stuffiness that comes with high fantasy... it taught me how a world could be built from such disparite and silly assets into something meaningful and absolutely grand.

Paper Mario and the Thousand Door showed to me the real world of Mario, a place where goombas and koopas were just... there, living normal lives. Normal people. All these monsters of mario, they were just guys some times, and that was just wonderful. It's such lithe worldbuilding, literally just a few silly locations and scenarios, but opened up the playing field to this rich and wild planet where the Mushroom Kingdom was JUST a location, where everything Mario did was part of a larger world.  I didn't know the concept of ""those filthy orcs"" or ""The evil goblins"" I just knew that... Goombas could be normal people you could talk to and that's just how the world works.

It showed me the importance of primary characters over the world itself, then. The places were fantastic, well designed with fun plot lines with wonderful music and art. But Mario and his partners were so alive and full of character, just oozing with charm (to use a classic gamerism). This was the focus of the game, rather than a more straightforward story, we got various scenarios like episodes of a TV show with the characters supporting every act.

These heroes going on a quest to stop an ancient evil hidden in a great dungeon, acting to collect the various macguffins, fight dragons and- wait, what? Has this just turned into a fantasy RPG out of nowhere??? This is MARIO mama-mia papa pizza MARIO BROS. But there's so much to it! There's so much to gain of an understanding of fantasy from just this game. 

This was and IS the foundation of my understanding of fantasy as a genre, and what I build off of when I write and create. Weird as it may seem, if you haven't played it, you may just find use of it as another aspect in your repotoire...

besides it's just like a really good game to play, top notch turn based RPG honestly. 

Also Super Paper Mario is amazing, you just didn't get it.

Also play Steven Universe: Save the Light if you like TTYD, it's basically Paper Mario but with a steven universe coat of paint.

980,"Looking for a Small Unit Tactics Fantasy Battle SimulatorI'm looking for a way to simulate fantasy battles between small groups of mixed units for a project I'm working on, and was wondering if there were any games/websites where I could do this.

For example, let's say I wanted to simulate a fight between two pikemen, three swordsmen and an archer against five bandits armed with swords. The goal being to see how that would play out in different situations to study the tactics each side might use.

I know I could just pull out D&amp;D books, roll up characters, and then run it with pencil, paper, and dice on my tabletop, but I was wondering if there were any simulators available that might make the job quicker and easier. Heck, even ones where I have to manually order each unit in a turn-based situation is fine if I can choose the units and placement and the computer handles the combat.",1
981,"Blackwing - Book ReviewI usually like to present a balanced review that mentions the highs and lows of any particular book I read. But shucks…I just couldn’t fill out the cons side of the list. Allow me, instead, to gush. Blackwing was hands down my favorite read of 2019. What a world! It’s got hard-bitten characters, magic that is central to the story,  and a mystery that kept me guessing until the end. I loved this book. I. Loved. This. Book.

Blackwing tells the story of Ryhalt Galharrow and his increasingly desperate quest to save the Republic from an invasion by the Deep Kings, ancient inhuman sorcerers of near god-like power. He is a mercenary type, commanding a small group that hunts fugitives in the Misery, a no-man’s-land of magic gone awry that separate his nation from the Deep Kings. Galharrow serves one of the Nameless, his republic’s own inhuman sorcerers, pitted in a centuries old war against the Deep Kings.

Our protagonist, Ryhalt Galharrow, is a time honored hard drinking veteran/noir detective trope, that has his own quirks and backstory to differentiate him from other characters cast in this vein. When his long lost loved reenters the picture, his hope and nihilism take turns beating him over the head as he grapples with the hopelessness of his cause, and the reality that he serves a master every bit as selfish and inhuman as his enemy. The supporting cast is also colorful and unique. I wouldn’t say the novel has particularly deep characters, but each serves the story excellently. If there was one part of the book that didn’t quite click for me, it was the love story. It all made sense and read believably and kept things moving, but it didn’t evoke big feels.

The writing in Blackwing is excellent. It is clear and concise, but twisted through the lens of Galharrow’s black humor and cynicism. At every point it flows well, evoking character, and occasionally throwing in a little artistic flourish, or a wisecrack that brought a smirk to the corner of my mouth. Read this book.  Can’t be any clearer on that. It's a delight.

The setting is another huge selling point for this novel. The darlings and brides and drudges comprise a really cohesive and cool batch of baddies, humans warped by magic into monstrous abominations. The Deep Kings and the Nameless serve as great, epic level contending forces that make their appearances at key moments to ramp up the danger. Not to mention “the Misery”, a patch of land intentionally blighted by magic to ward off invasion. It all combines to create a unique flintlock fantasy with a dark twist.

Blackwing is the most promising first novel I have read in a very long time. I am 100% going to devour the rest of this trilogy in short order. Do yourself a favor and get on board. Five Stars.

Now I am inspired to ask: **What do you consider hard to read, and why? What does hard mean to you? Recommend me some puzzlers please!**


I'll start with two of the usual suspects: The Wizard Knight by Gene Wolfe and Latro in the Mist by Gene Wolfe.


I found it hard to grasp the significance of a lot of what was happening in the Wizard Knight because I wasn't great at discerning the symbolism and subtext. Was Able dying? What's with the twinning? How much time fuckery happening? 


Latro was difficult for me because of the narrator's amnesia. It was a lot of work for me to piece together what the action of certain scenes were from Latro's rather broken diary entries.",1

991,"Strange the Dreamer comes so close.. Does it hit or miss in your opinion?Edit: I meant to mention in the title, and now I can’t edit. Be warned, THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR STRANGE THE DREAMER.

I’m feeling so torn about Strange the Dreamer. I’m hoping someone out there feels similarly (or doesn’t, and can engage with me about their difference of opinion).

So many people talk about it as such a beautiful work of art. And I feel like it just... comes so close. But maybe misses the mark? Around the time of the never-ending dream make out session until the ending. Here’s my take: 

Very enjoyable, if a bit young adult-y. But that’s exactly what it is. Fascinating world and some wonderful characters that did not, however, get explored or fleshed out enough. 

The romance plot towards the end gets a bit much with the making out. It was sweet and romantic at first, and then a bit overdone, but then again, at 14 I would’ve enjoyed that aspect, and again, it’s YA. I much preferred their mutual adventures and deep and playful conversations to flesh out their romance, personally. I also did not love how Sarai needed continuous validation from Lazlo. It was VERY emo. I had to keep reminding myself it’s YA at this point, but I wouldn’t exactly want Sarai to be my daughter’s YA role model.. Lazlo also lost some personality here, his job seemingly being to continuously validate Sarai and try to solve her problems.

I did love the talk between Ruby and Sparrow at the end. It could’ve easily become a love triangle with the two girls at each other’s throats, but it ended in sisterly love and friendship instead, which was nice. Ruby’s jibe about it being a one-plum love was cute. 

I absolutely hate that it ended on a cliffhanger — I would’ve preferred one long book, or for it to have ended with Sarai’s death, or even their embrace once she’s reconstituted. The hint of Minya not returning the hug would’ve been enough. I still would’ve begun the next book. I’m not at all a fan of cliff-hangers at the end of books unless they’re REALLY earned. Otherwise it seems a bit cheap to me. If your book is good, I’ll read the next. No need to leave me hanging.

I called every single major plot-point before it happened. I figured out why his skin was turning gray, that he would have the gift he had, and whose child he was (although I also wondered if he could be the child of Azereen?). Nothing was a reveal to me, and I’m not the type to guess everything when I read. It was just super obvious to me here. But that said, I still enjoyed reading it come to fruition. Could not put it down for the second half, actually. 

I think Laini Taylor writes beautifully and has a wonderfully creative mind for world-building. I feel like if she spent a little more time explaining and exploring her world and the characters and relationships and backstories, took out some of the kind of pointless emo-type drama with the godspawn, which felt clunky and out of place next to Lazlo’s story, and if she had maybe woven in a few more early clues and fewer late clues as to the culmination (so it would be harder to guess but easier to trace all the way back when big reveals happen), this would be a perfect book. I just loved the idea of the book and was frustrated with the ending, how much was left out, how many characters we are introduced to for no reason, how many storylines don’t end up playing into anything or going anywhere.

I absolutely LOVED Lazlo as a protagonist. How endearing he was, with his fairy tale broken nose and deep gray eyes and love for stories. His kindness and virtue. Even his innocence. I adored him. I enjoyed Calixte and was disappointed she wasn’t featured more prominently. So many interesting characters who we barely meet or talk to. So many who seemed so interesting, but we heard so little from them and what we did hear was fairly one-dimensional. Eril-Fane. His mother. Azereen. Thyon. Calixte. Drave. Even the godspawn weren’t fleshed out much, other than their individual powers and romantic inclinations, none of which wove into the actual story at all.

I also think there was too much time spent on stuff that ended up meaningless or not very important. Like Lazlo’s sacred promise to Thyon, his knowledge of stories, the azoth recipe he solved and gave to Thyon, Thyon’s relationship with his family, his connection with his spectral, the descriptions and introduction to monsters like the threaves, the wraith, the talents of the other faranji, Calixte’s wager about climbing the anchor, the buildings and institutions crushed by the anchors, the love story with Ruby and Feral, and the powers of the godspawn other than Minya and Sarai. So many things introduced and then never utilized or elaborated on. Things that seemed important but then never came into play. So much wasted potential there! 

Or alternatively, things that never seemed that important and, turns out, truly weren’t. Looking at you, Feral/Ruby. 

I read in an interview that Taylor does not use any kind of outline and just lets the story take her where it will, and unfortunately, with all these loose threads hanging around, it shows. I would’ve liked for her to go over her work and give all those threads a little more explanation or some satisfying conclusions at the very least, or better yet if she’d found ways to weave them into the main story, instead of having all these awesome ideas prove fairly meaningless.

In all, I really did enjoy this book, and I’m already beginning the second. I couldn’t put it down, and although the story had its flaws, the writing was really beautifully descriptive. And y’all, I LOVE Lazlo. It’s just frustrating how NEARLY perfect this book is. I could just FEEL the author’s potential for greatness, and the story’s potential for being a true modern epic, and that made the flaws hurt all the more. I would not waste my time lamenting and going over the flaws if the book didn’t mean something to me.

 I would rate it 4.5 stars for prose and 3 for storytelling. Maybe 3.5 when you consider that it’s a YA novel. Either way, I look forward to reading Laini Taylor’s future works as she grows as a storyteller.

I would love to hear how others feel about the book, and my review. I am honestly dying to discuss it!",1
992,"Most effective general in fantasy? (spoilers: all writing and everything to be written)Thinking of historical figures like Alexander and Belisarius has got me wondering who the most effective general in fantasy literature might be.

Candidates I can come up with include:

Tavore Paran - marched an army across the world and won a few wars in the process, ultimately liberating a continenent

anasurimbor kellhus - He conquered the world through his incredible foresight, but was ultimately killed. His command of magic played a big role which perhaps overshadows his ability on the battlefield.

Aegon the Conqueror - GRRM goes to great lengths to show it wasn't just dragons that allowed him to conquer Westeros.

993,"I just finished Mad ShipIt was good. I hesitate to call it great because there are some things that I find a little lacking, but most of it was compensated by other elements to bring it all together. 

**Review**

**What I liked**

* The characters. The best thing about Robin Hobb's work is by far the characters. The prose, dialogue, and worldbuilding are nothing to sneeze at, but it's the characters that make it all work. Kennit was my favorite in Ship of Magic and is still my favorite in Mad Ship. This smart, charismatic, manipulative, insane bastard is such a delight to read about. I don't think I've ever read a character quite like him. &gt;! The ascension to become a beloved king/ruler is a trope that I can't get enough of. Like the first book, it's a bit far-fetched sometimes, but Kennit is just so much fun that I let it slide. His backstory and the gradual reveal is maddening and thus well-executed too. !&lt; I liked Althea, Wintrow, and Brashen's characters better now that there are more layers to them and because they have more interactions with other characters. Their growth has been slow and steady - the way it should be. 
* Worldbuilding. Somehow, Hobb strikes the balance between Rothfuss-style hints and Sanderson-style avalanches. It's the perfect combination that lets me piece things together, feeling at once close and far from the full picture. It's infuriating in the best way. 
* Agency. I never realized how much I wanted protagonists to actually do something until they did. Technically it's still a reaction, &gt;! but the decision to take the Paragon and save Vivacia felt daring. That was the point that hooked me. !&lt;
* The liveships. Both of their development has been stellar. &gt;! I liked Vivacia's 'descent' into piracy. It makes perfect sense for an impressionable young woman with an identity crisis to have Stockholm Syndrome and enjoy being groomed with a charismatic and driven madman. Paragon's slow improvement is also impressive. It's difficult to have a character become more sympathetic while retaining that unpredictability, but Robin Hobb pulls it off once more. I still can't believe the character I related to the most is a talking ship. !&lt;

**What I didn't like**

* Pacing. The eternal problem with Robin Hobb's work has always been the pacing. I feel like at least 10% of the book could be removed or condensed and it would've been better, but now that I'm asking myself what I would change, I struggle to find the solution. Maybe I'm just used to fast-paced books.
* Malta. &gt;! I understood her role in the book even when she was a brat. I liked her growth as a character but the change felt a little rushed. There was a traumatic event that caused it, but her development only happened after a few pages explaining her sudden maturity. I can buy it, but if it's going to be a slow book anyway, then I think she could've taken more time with her. !&lt;
* Investment. I'm not sure what it is, but I was never invested in the characters. I was interested, but I never saw them as more than just characters that I read about vicariously. It's a far cry from Fitz, Burrich, Chade, Patience, and the rest of the Farseer gang. During the particularly slow first half of the book I could only think about starting the Tawny Man trilogy.
* Serilla. Maybe it was necessary, but I think her POV was boring, didn't bring anything new to the table, and only served as shock value to make us the Satrap more. 

**TL;DR** Objective and personal 7.9/10. A small dip in quality from Ship of Destiny but still solid. 

**Thoughts, theories, and wild guesses (SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION!)**

* The serpents will all go to the Rain Wilds, where Tintaglia will call in a favor for Malta and Reyn to turn into dragons. They will then follow She Who Remembers' memories and be indebted to Wintrow. 
* Paragon was attacked by Igrot and knows where his treasure is. He's the last member of his crew, the only one Kennit couldn't kill. The treasure will somehow be related to the Elderlings, maybe an instruction of how to find them, or the Skill needed to navigate their cities.
* The rescue team will find Vivacia and give her a chance to go, but she'll refuse to leave Kennit in a crucial moment and Kennit will use that moment to kill Althea/Brashen. This causes Wintrow to snap and command the dragons to kill Kennit. 
* Malta will fall in love with Reyn and they'll have the only happy ending. The other Vestrits will die, except Wintrow and Althea.
* Kyle will return with Kennit's mother as a hostage. Kennit will kill them both. 
* Bingtown will declare independence and maybe join the pirates' kingdom. The dragons will fend off Jamillia or Chalced, but most likely both. 
* The Satrap will be killed in the first half of the book. 

I hope you enjoyed reading my review and thoughts. Even if you're intimidated by the slow pacing, everyone should read the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogy. Robin Hobb deserves more than an eternal TBR status. Give it a shot!

So the pirate is a metaphor but the pirate is also Time. Does that mean the first pirate story we read, where the woman is killed in the pirate's place, is the same event as the first time Fate was killed for loving Time? Or was that a later incarnation?

But if you, like me, have bad vision and are unable to read print, then your options for reading (or listening to audiobooks in this case) gets limited.

You can pay for Audible (I have since November 2013), or if you are lucky enough to be near a local library with Overdrive, you can wait weeks and weeks for an audiobook to become available, or you can buy audio books outright (does anyone still do this?).

Did you know, that if you live in the US (I am sure other country have similar programs) you may be able to get access to the Library of Congress's [National Library Service](https://www.loc.gov/nls/)? You can get books via mail order, web download, and as of a couple of years ago there's even a smartphone app!  


The [eligibility requirements](https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/eligibility-for-nls-services/) are pretty basic, the selection of books is huge, they even have magazines. The narration is hit and miss sometimes, older books recorded say before the 90s can have that older narration style where someone is just reading the book. Newer books have volunteer readers of reasonable quality, and sometimes professional readers Increasingly in the last few years publishers will just make available commercial audio books to the NLS. The books are all encrypted and require a special player, but that's to be expected.  


So if you are someone you know has trouble reading, check out the National Library Service and enjoy books again!",0

1004,"""Probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written""(There are some spoilers about Star Maker in this text, but I'm unsure whether you can even call them spoilers since the book is about an idea about consciousness rather than a traditional conflict driven novel, and as such is more a philosophy told through a story. If you plan to read it and prefer not to know, I recommend you stop reading here.) 

Someone recommended ""Star Maker"" by Olaf Stapledon to me a few years back. I'm an avid consumer of sci-fi, although the past ten years I've consumed it more in movie/series formats than books. Since Arthur C Clarke, who was one of my favorite authors as a kid who escaped a lot into books, called it ""probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written"" and several other authors considered it to be very influential in their work (and CS Lewis called the end ""devil worship""), I decided to give it a go. 

I have to admit that it wasn't an easy read if you're used to the traditional western way of storytelling with conflict as a major driver of the plot. It really was quite imaginative, so much so that when I reached about 70% where he wrote about stars communicating with each other, I put it down. I had reached the limits of my suspension of disbelief for that time. Still, I couldn't get it out of my head, and I eventually returned to it and finished it. 

It took a couple years for me to digest it, but in hindsight I can see that It changed my mindset in a very profound way. It paved the way for an existential crisis that was turbulent, sometimes very unpleasant, but in the end very constructive. I can see why so many sci-fi authors have found it influential, because it doesn't touch technology at all - instead it deals with consciousness from a cosmic perspective.

1011,"I just finished Wm Gibson's ""Agency"" [plot points revealed]I'm not seeing a dedicated review thread for this book. Apologies if I missed it. Don't read this post if you don't want spoilers.

I always think of the release of a new Gibson book as a big deal.

I re-read The Peripheral in anticipation / preparation for this one -- Agency is definitely its sequel (perhaps that's not 100% the semantically-correct term, given that the near-present half of the story takes place earlier than the near-present portion of The Peripheral -- but the far-future portion is sequential to the previous book's, and both segments feature characters introduced there). It's also (it seems to me) very clearly the second book in one of his trilogies. (Hopefully not his last, but SF writers tend not to have that long a shelf life).

The Peripheral has a lot of tics and flavors I've come to savor from Billy G: low-rent characters facing hi-tech challenges, a certain amount of fascination with the machinery of fame, substance abuse problems, and sweet, fragmented prose.

Agency doesn't really have those things, unless you want to count gig-economy knowledge workers as ""low-rent"", and the entirety of Silicon Valley society as caught up in a culture of fame implementation. What I miss though is the tightness of prose in this one -- I am thinking that the last-minute rewrite due to a Hillary-less White House, and the unfortunate death of his long-time editor, have resulted in a book that doesn't really feel finished. (And I kind of miss Wilf Netherton's drinking problem -- I'm glad he's happier, but he's a bit less interesting as a dad).

I'm going to skip over Eunice, who's very much the most interesting character in the book, and a spiritual grand-daughter to Mike in Heinlein's Moon Is A Harsh Mistress. Her antics are pretty cool and amount to a kind of sufficiently-advanced-technology-indistinguishable...

Kirkus Reviews rags on the book pretty badly, calling it ""possibly tired"" and I have to agree that the middle half of the story is basically a chase that doesn't expose us to very much that's cutting-edge interesting. It mostly seemed like stalling, while certain other threads in the book could catch up.

I thought of it as a kind of shell game, or a juggling act. After Eunice disappears in Chapter 35 -- Gibson employing his trademark one scene per chapter, a tic I've always enjoyed -- (and  I couldn't ever see her as permanently deleted, so the stakes never felt high to me -- similarly for the impending nuclear war), Verity Jones is chased by bad guys, switches vehicles, hides somewhere, gets found out. Wash-rinse-repeat until we're about 90% through the book.  Upstream, in 2136 London, Lowbeer dispatches threats to her person that were never too credible.

Unlike Flynn, Peripheral's protagonist, Jones never really \*does\* anything. She follows instructions from people who, like her, also have no real idea why they are doing the things they are doing. Who lack agency. Which I assume is no accident, and maybe after I've digested it further I'll get the joke.

I don't mean to be unremittingly negative. William Gibson always gives me something to think about. In this case, I think it's obvious that the third book of the trilogy will address the fact that no one in the Lowbeer / Netherton future knows how the connections to the ""stubs"" are made, and that they themselves are probably a ""big stub"" (as Connor jokes). So that should be fun. And so should the existence of a self-aware AI who will no doubt be multi-homed in different continua.

Agency sort of sits for me in the same category as Spook Country and Zero History -- sequels to an excellent book that are themselves not nearly so excellent.",0

1013,"In this thread I shill hard for AnathemAbout 3 years ago I got introduced to science fiction when a friend handed me Dark Matter (Crouch) and told me in no uncertain terms that I must read it. In the decade prior to this I had read exactly 1 book, the DaVinci Code, and never even knew I had friends that *could* read, let alone were getting excited enough about it to aggressively share book recommendations.


I was in my early 30s at the time, still holding onto my 20s by spending my free time and money between bars and video games, and had absolutely zero interest in sitting down to read books. Which is to say that when this friend thrust a book into my hands and told me to read it, my decision to read it had nothing to do with the book itself. I thought he must need to tell me something, or maybe there's something bigger at play here. Or he's on drugs and hopefully he's left me some between the pages. The notion that he recommended a book to me because he had read it, enjoyed it, and thought that I too would enjoy it never crossed my mind.


So I started reading it right away and finished it that same day. This was quite the impressive feat at the time for me. Not so much that I read an entire book in one day, but rather the fact that a book was able to keep my attention for longer than 20 minutes. I called my friend and interrogated him as to why he wanted me to read it, and it turns out he just really liked the book and knew me well enough to know I'd like it too. Mother. Fucker.


And I did enjoy it. So much that I googled ""books to read if you like Dark Matter"" and immediately ordered the Red Rising trilogy the search results pointed me towards. 2 days later they arrive and I blow through the trilogy in a week. Learning that science fiction was more than my parent's Stargate SG-1 was a major discovery. Being able and eager to prioritize reading over television and video games was a revelation.


Looking back I'm a bit embarrassed at how amazed I was at Dark Matter and Red Rising. They're both good enough books, for sure, but they're also very simple and barely scratch the surface of what science fiction is able to accomplish. Dark Matter in particular left me feeling quite silly after I re-read it a few months ago. It's a fun book, no doubt, but it is the quintessential ""basic bitch"" of big idea scifi. It is also, as it turns out, the perfect amount of basic bitch fun to grab a disaffected non-reader by the balls and have them thank you for it.


After Red Rising I found r/printSF, sorted by all-time best, and quickly had a list of books that kept popping up in the recommendations threads. Hyperion, Blindsight, Neuromancer, Children of Time, the Culture, the Quantum Thief, Revelation Space, and so on. Real, hardcore science fiction. Not Dark Matter. 


I launched straight into Hyperion and was mesmerized throughout all 4 books. You've all read it, you all know what I'm talking about, and those of you that say the two Endymion books are garbage: no, you're garbage!


Then came news that Obama was reading a science fiction book called The Three-Body Problem, apparently the greatest work of Chinese science fiction and newly translated into English. Immediately following Hyperion I dove into TBP and the series ended up defining what it is I love about science fiction in the same way that the Expanse series defines what it is I hate. 


Big ideas, drawn out to interesting places and exploring the philosophical and societal ramifications. I don't care if the prose isn't perfect or if the characters weren't expertly crafted. Bring me real science mixed with the purely theoretical, the more fringe the better, and shatter my mind with the philosophy that emerges if things end up being this particular flavor of *just right*. Save your hero journeys, spare me your space operas. I once was blind but now I see; Red Rising is pulp fiction and Blood Music is a masterpiece. Fight me.


Over the next 2 ½ years I read a few hundred books. I consider myself quite well read in the hard science fiction space, although I admit I've restricted myself primarily to science fiction's brand name authors and their most popular works (I'll read you soon, Ophiuchi Hotline, I promise).


I say all of this because context is important, and I want you to know exactly what kind of reader I am so that when I tell you that Anathem is the greatest book of all time you'll know that it comes from someone that knows what they're talking about. Or doesn't. Maybe you think the Expanse is top shelf scifi and that Robert Wilson's 'Spin' is highfalutin crap. Maybe you read Roadside Picnic and thought it wasn't that big of a deal, and maybe you think A Fire Upon the Deep could have spent more time with the dogs.


What I'm trying to say is that every once in a while you come across a book that alters the way you view everything that came before and all that will come after. Hyperion and TBP are two such examples for me. Anathem is the latest, the first in a year or two, and has rocked my foundation as a reader more so than maybe even Dark Matter did when I was a novice. I foresee this being the stick with which all else is measured for a very, very long time.


To sum it all up, I feel both privileged to have had the opportunity to experience Anathem and also deeply saddened by the fact I am now likely cursed never to witness another reach such heights.  If you've read Stephenson then you know what it is to be hurt by Stephenson. Anathem makes up for all his prior sins, not wasting a single one of its 932 pages and sticks the landing to perfection.

Now a bunch of people are partying their last few days away in Yosemite and some kid from Ohio is heading out onto one of the great lakes. It's not a meditative piece on depression like Melancholia was.

I feel like Seveneves did what this book was trying to do 1000% better. There's the slow reveal of what's going to happen to the earth, there's the thoughtful sections on how people are dealing with the doom (Dubois' son launching rockets, the Notre Dame orchestra), and then there's all of the action of trying to survive.

1024,"Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky - an excellent premise that didn't deliver on its promiseI just finished Tchaikovsky's Children of Time and I was wondering if anyone wanted to discuss it. This was a book I was very excited to read. The premise sounded exactly up my alley - generational ship, alien planet, first contact. Awesome, sign me up because I live for that shit.

Unfortunately, after finishing the book, I can't help but feel disappointed for a variety of reasons. Before I explain why, I'll mention what I *did* like about it. That would be, probably unsurprisingly, the Spider culture. Tchaikovsky did some incredible worldbuilding here, using biological and cultural evolution and extrapolating it to a species that's both familiar and extremely alien. It was fascinating to see the Spider culture evolve on a different timescale, and their battle to survive and thrive felt pretty epic at times. They really did feel like the main protagonists of the story.

Now there's my biggest problem with the book, and that's the human protagonists. They take up a good 50% of the book and honestly, they are *boring as shit*. Like I honestly can't even pick a single individual out because of how much personality they lacked. Mason, Lain, Karst, Guyen...who is who? Who knows? They just randomly did things to move the plot along. No development whatsoever, and the interactions between them were boring and wooden.

Another issue I had was the weird pacing in the human section. We just kind of jumped from one event to the next without a lot of build-up or tension. I get that a lot of time passed between these events but I never felt like the author did a very good job of actually portraying this passage. Mason just wakes up one day and all of a sudden there are a bunch of cultists running around and Lain is some kind of Xena warrior woman. It's just done in a really flat and deadpan manner that robs these seemingly big events and incidences of their impact. The dialogue and conversation between the characters, as I mentioned, is really wooden and perfunctory. Maybe this was done on purpose, as ultimately they have been suspended in time for like a couple thousand years, but it doesn't make it any more fun to read.

I also thought that the potentially epic, cinematic premise was wasted because of the lack of visual storytelling. I never got a full mind's eye image of the environment they were in. A lot of authors can paint vivid pictures in your head, especially in sci fi, that really immerses you and makes you feel the vastness of space and the beauty and majesty of celestial bodies. CoT was curiously absent of any kind of sense of wonder from this standpoint. The planet is *green*, the spiders are *monstrous*, the Gilgamesh is *old* and that's the only description we ever get of them essentially. Really a missed opportunity to create something beautiful here, given the canvas Tcahikovsky was working with.

So yeah all in all, a bit of a disappointment for me. I did like the last quarter or so quite a bit, and the Spider world stuff kept me going but overall it was weak.

1030,"A few questions about Recursion by Blake Crouch (Plenty of Spoilers)OK, so I will preface this with saying that overall, I enjoyed the novel quite a bit. It's the followup to his other novel *Dark Matter* in style, if not in content. It is fun, thrilling, occasionally thought-provoking. I have always been interested in things like the hard problem of consciousness, and the intersection between thought, memory, and reality. I have a few questions though:

1) Is there any actual explanation given for why people using Helena's process are actually able to go back and change time, not only for themselves but everyone else? I understand being able to experience memories non-linearly, like in *Slaughterhouse Five* or *Arrival* but the only explanation given here is some hand-wavey stuff like 'well, its quantum mechanics!'. Which, honestly, is OK! It's OK to break the laws of physics and causality for the sake of the story, I'm just wondering if there's something deeper to it

2) Why is Barry Sutton able to go back to a 'dead memory'? It seems that there is an established rule that you can't go back to memories that existed in a timeline that no longer exists. However, Slade tells him there's a way.. and it turns out, the way to do it is just 'try very hard'. What??

3) In the end, Barry goes back to a timeline right before he discovered the whole time travel stuff, after his daughter died, etc. But... Helena still exists!! Slade still exists!! How does going back to this particular timeline prevent the things that will happen later? Also... science does not depend on a single person. If Helena was able to discover this technology, then it is a certainty that others have or will discover it in the future. Why aren't there literally millions of future time travelers trying to change history constantly for their benefit?

Ehh, I'm probably reading too much into it.",0

I'm posting this to get some ideas on what to take up to make a break in our current monster-marathon of the LOTR. I'm telling stories to kids almost every night or sometimes reading to them. Until now I've mostly been ""adjusting"" things, so to say - I tell an abridged version because my kids are 5. But we recently started reading the lord of the rings, and it's a long story. And I've decided to actually read it and not tell it abridged (like we did with hobbit).

1. Recent - preferably published after 2010. I find that earlier books (especially those written pre-2000) don't deal well with the effects of computers and the internet.
2. About colonies in the solar system, preferably orbital habitats around Earth, but lunar/mars colonies or asteroid mining outposts are also fine.
3. About the founding of the habitat/colony: either the actual building of the habitat, or the creation of a political entity from the habitat.

Now I suddenly find myself in the mood to read it again (I've been on a rereading kick for some reason) and I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to spend the $$$ on the revamped series or just go through my old paperbacks again. I know there are a couple of new prequel novels, which I'll probably check out either way, but I just don't know how different the new versions of the existing story are. It looks like the new set will be 20 books total once it's finished, which is a bit of an investment, so if it's not worth it I won't bother, but if it's really a marked improvement over the original I don't mind investing the time and money.

1044,"Which of the Xeelee novels should I read?I keep eyeing this series but I'm always torn between interest in the premise wiki states and the bleak, downtrodden humanity stories I see when looking into the novels on amazon.
I really dislike bleak, downtrodden settings, I really like Peter F. Hamilton's Salvation series but that is about humanity being  an underdog that fights back. 

Also, looking at the plot premises on wiki the stories seem fairly disjointed, e.g. the first Destiny's Children novel is in the near future, the 2nd is 20,000 years later and the 3rd alternates between the near future and the year 500,000.
I'm not very interested in near future stuff either, can I understand the for me interesting parts with space opera setting and no overly bleak and downtrodden characters while skipping the stuff I don't like?

And, which of the Xeelee novels should I read? I don't mind some bleak / downtrodden stuff if it's not the majority of the novel and the rest is more of the stuff I like.

Some plot lines of Hornblower/Aubrey (as Mr. Spearman explicitly acknowledges at one point). I found it an excellent read and would strongly recommend. Very much reflects 18thC British naval traditions etc. No further spoilers lol.

It was too obvious from the start he was behind everything, why else would his character exist and be introduced in the early stages of the book?

It's as if he is disconnected from the entire story as a separate entity and is just there to allow the book to have an ending. It felt too easy and a bit rushed.

I'd prefer an Earth-based setting. Planetary travel can exist, but I'd prefer if the story stayed put if possible and definitely no aliens. Think Blade Runner setting, or even Ready Player One had a good vibe. If it were a visual medium I'd want to be bombarded with neon. Think the scene in Altered Carbon(netflix version) where Takeshi is overwhelmed by neon advertising. I want that level of high-octane commercialism and consumerism.

I read the first few pages of Neuromancer and Snow Crash, and so far Snow Crash hooked me more, but I don't know enough about Neuromancer to know if it's what I'm looking for. Ive been burned on Stephenson before though, couldn't finish either of his I started (Seveneves or Anathem) so I don't know if I should push forward. Though it is half the length so maybe my problems with him aren't there in SC.

I'd been in a Mr Robot kick so any anarchy/hacking is a big plus, and obviously any noir elements are way up my alley.

I listened to the audiobook of Altered Carbon and while I loved a lot of it(the character, the setting, most of the plot), I wasn't in love with the writing. It was kind of bad, and it was maybe the only book I've ever read to make me think ""wow I wish that sex scene wasnt there"". I'm completely fine with them but his specifically just seemed like an excuse to write about somebody cumming on someone's face over and over.

1075,"Just finished The Peripheral by William Gibson--thoughts?Spoilers ahead, obviously.

I quite liked it. Definitely my favorite thing he's written since Neuromancer (for reference, I've read the whole Sprawl trilogy, Virtual Light, Idoru, and Pattern Recognition). 

The near-future bits really nailed it for me. I don't actually necessarily think the future will be as grim as he depicts, but it was nonetheless a very plausible and fleshed-out description of a future that I could imagine potentially coming true. 

I actually found myself less invested in the far-future timeline. I didn't really connect much with Netherton as a character, though Ainsley Lowbeer was always fun to have on the page. The jackpot was one of the scarier fictional apocalypses I've ever seen--the lack of melodrama made it feel all the more plausible. Somehow, imagining the slow, grinding attrition of 80% of the human race from a neverending train of resource wars, famines, superbugs, climate change-related disasters, etc... was much more horrific than the standard science-fictional nuclear war or dimensional rift or what have you. I liked (as a narrative device, not as an IRL concept) the idea of a world populated entirely by the descendants of 21st-century kleptocrats, but I felt like having them explicitly revert to old-timey systems of government was a bit too on-the-nose; Gibson handled it tastefully enough, but I think he could have just left that out and justified any weirdness as ""they're kleptocrats, they're just like that."" 

I'm of two minds about the structure. On one hand, the very closely-entangled narratives and very short chapters prevented that kind of ""aww *man*, I was just getting invested in this character, why do I have to read about someone else?"" effect that I feel creates a continuous background radiation of dissapointment for me when I usually read novels with the two PoV entwined-narratives-that-come-together-about-halfway-through format. On the other hand, sometimes the chapters felt a little *too* short; I think maybe if the average chapter had been one-and-a-half to two times as long as they were, it would have been a good sweet spot for me.

Overall I found the plotting tight and enjoyable, but the ending threw me a little bit. The resolution to the Aelita West murder mystery was so bland that I literally don't remember what it was, and I read the book *yesterday*. I don't even remember if they ever explained who the guy who murdered Aelita was, other than that he was in league w/ Daedra, Hamed al-Habib, and the Remembrancer guy. Gibson is talented enough of a writer that I have to imagine that was intentional, for whatever reason, but it sort of robbed the climax of some of its impact. I also felt like the ending, with Flynne and all her friends shacking up with random other named characters, was frankly bizarre. I understand wanting to inject a bit of romance into the optimistic ending to an overall pretty grim book to really hammer home that things are going to be OK, but it was kind of cheesy.

Curious to hear everyone else's thoughts on this.",0
1076,"Please recommend me SF authors with a linear story tellingHi everyone

I enjoy SF books a lot. However, I noticed that sometimes I'd get annoyed if the storytelling gets too non - linear, jumping between characters, places and times. I prefer if the story really focuses on the main character(s) and main story even if that means a limited viewpoint.

Here are some books that I enjoyed :

Culture series: two of my favourite books overall are player of games and excession but I have to admit that I couldn't get into use of weapons 

Expanse series: I really enjoyed the series until cibola burns (even if less linear than the other books in my list, it's just too good not to mention) 

Roadside picnic: possibly the most unique ""alien contact"" story I've ever read

Daemon &amp; freedom (D. Suarez): I have a weak spot for AI stories and this one is very entertaining to read

The long way to a Small angry planet (and the rest of the series): a lot of likeable characters, plus an AI character

I see this a LOT in sci-fi series that take place over hundreds / thousands / even hundreds of thousands of years. A lot of sci-fi series treat time passage as a pretty inconsequential side effect of far future technology that turns humans immortal or time dilation lets you travel close to light speed and see empires rise and fall. 

The ships will all be using pretty much the same tech, or even when they are vastly more advanced, they will still be using the old tech along side vastly superior tech . . .it's just weird 


""The M1 Abrams tank rolled on to the battlefield and fired it's 120mm smooth bore main cannon, obliterating the enemies chariots. It deployed it's side mounted Ballista and opened fire on the enemies rear guard, punching right through their iron reinforced shields. It's back mounted catapults let fly cast iron siege stones into the enemy lines. The .50mm anti-personnel machine gun shredded it's way through a dozen enemy horses before they could charge. As the enemy drew closer, the top gunner leapt onto the tank and began swiping at the enemies with his bronze sword""

Like, wut? I know it's supposed to be ""tech plateau""  but it always just ends up being stupid to me. Yes a bomb that could destroy a small moon was mighty impressive and cutting edge when you invented it in book 1 . . .but in book 6 it's been 4,000 years since then and half your basic weapons now can take out a solar system, and you literally have hand mounted infantry guns that can match your previous moon killer, why are your top of the line battle ships still carrying those???",0
1079,"hyperion - book 1 - where does the idea of the shrike granting wishes come from?in the context of the first book, which i just finished, where does this concept of making a pilgrimage to the shrike to get your wish granted even come from?


there doesn't appear to be any evidence/story (in book 1) of it ever happening in reality or in legend


for example, there are modern day ""spiritual healings"" and such, which even if they can't be verified, one could go and talk to someone who believes it happened to them


or, even if no one is rising from the dead recently, the bible has the story of lazarus coming out of his tomb


but in hyperion, there seems to be a rather established practice of groups of people meetings up, marching off to the time tombs, and getting themselves impaled on the shrike's tree (spoke about as an actual physical object, not some abstract metaphor) - but there doesn't seem to a story about anyone getting a wish granted, verifiable or not


while we may think their beliefs are goofy, if a group of people has heard stories or accounts of some river or shrine having healing properties, it makes 'sense' to travel to go get healed yourself. but there needs to be at least a legend or something to start that belief, even if it's based on an outright lie


in book one at least, i dont remember there being an even tangential reference to anyone's wish being granted, at anytime in the present or past, ever.


i get that many of our characters have other reasons to end up on hyperion, but ignoring that, where did this belief in wish granting come from?


it seems rather simple for the author to add a few lines about 'someone, once, in the distant past, had some wish granted', even IF that is a lie propagated by the shrike church. but to my memory, there wasn't one. i can't imagine simmons would just.. forget. but if it's intentional, that is never commented on in narration or by the characters either.

1080,"Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream theorySo, in the novel-within-a-novel, does anyone notice that Feric Jaggar displays many of the traits he associates with Dominators? Based on solely the text, Feric Jaggar would seem to be a human-Dominator hybrid who mistakenly believes himself to be human. Examples:

* When a Dominator speaks, he tends to immediately draw rapt and respectful attention, and this also consistently happens when Feric himself speaks. 
* Feric refers to Dominators as weaving mental nets, webs, and patterns in which they ensnare victims, meanwhile, when Feric is speaking in public, he can feel ""lines of psychic energy"" connecting him and his audience. He is also able to instantly pick up on the mood of anyone he sees, and alter it by channeling his will at them.
* In any scene where both Feric and a Dominator are present, the two of them, and only the two of them, can mask their emotions completely, and they can also detect each other's emotions empathically. 
* He claims that Dominators view other beings as nothing more than their puppets, which he also seems to do. 
* He is the only non-Dominator character fully able to resist Dominators. 
* The state of genetic testing as presented in the novel is such that there is probably no test in existence that would distinguish a human-Dom hybrid from a human.

In the alternate universe which Spinrad presents, where Hitler is a science-fiction author, it's unlikely that Hitler's authorial intent would be to portray his human hero as unknowingly being of mixed species. However, I'm wondering if Spinrad deliberately intended to make Feric seem to be mixed species rather than the true human that Hitler portrays him as in-world. So far, I haven't been able to get confirmation from the author on whether he intended this or not, but one other reviewer has pointed it out. Does anyone else think this is credible?",0
1081,"Looking for an old short story - Energy globes squash everything, turn out be be warp bubbles of starships from another dimensionI read this in the early '70s - I'm not sure if it was in a proper anthology, or just an extra story added in to pad out a short novel to proper paperback size.

Set in England I think (so probably a British author), mysterious globes of energy begin appearing and crushing everything in their path before disappearing again.
The male protagonist gets involved when he narrowly escapes when the building where he works (possibly a lab of some kind) gets destroyed by one of the globes. I think that he was in his car at the time - he got out before it was crushed but possibly a female passenger didn't.
On investigating, he finds that the globes contain starships from another dimension - to them our dimension is 'hyperspace' and the globes are how their ship's warp bubble manifest themselves here. The original globes appeared near London, and were black. Later white globes started to appear in the Midlands - at one point a black globe and a white globe travelled to meet each other. It later transpired the different coloured globes were starships belonging to two different civilisations.

The lead character manages to get inserted in one of the bubbles as it appears and contacts the crew of the ship inside - I can't remember how the story ends.",0

* Tchaikovsky's Children books

* Stross' abortive Singularity Sky series (too bad it's never going to be finished, apart form the amount of over-the-top in handling space Nazis I liked it very much - I do love your works otherwise /u/cstross, thanks for being a consistent, high quality and imaginative writer)

* Quantum Thief books by Rajaniemi

* Reynolds' Revelations Space books (the stellar Prefect and its presentable sequel as well) and House of Suns

1091,"Person as substitute conscienceSo I was rereading Vorkosigan, because Reasons, and I got to wondering... how often have I seen this trope?

The sociopath/psychopath character who needs someone of supreme moral fiber to act as a substitute conscience for him, to tell him or her when and who it is okay to kill.

The early Vorkosigan saga has the obvious one. There is such a pair in the Daniel Leary RCN series (actually, that one is doubled up). There is one in the Expanse (I’ll remain vague to avoid spoilers). Can you think of other examples?",0
1092,"What do books like A Civil Campaign by Lois Bujold come under? And what are more of them?I'm going through the Vorkosigan series by Lois Bujold. I've enjoyed them all so far, but a lot of them are just totally different to one another. Some focus on unraveling a mystery, some focus on action, etc.

But there's been three so far that have pretty much blown me away: Barrayar, Komarr, and most of all: a Civil Campaign.

Barrayar has a decent amount of action, but a lot of it is just Cordelia getting used to her new world and developing relationships. Komarr is mostly about Miles meeting and falling in love with Kat, with a bit of a mystery and some action as well.

But then you have a Civil Campaign. There's one single brief chapter of action, and the rest is just characters milling about and doing their own thing. One character is developing butter out of big vomit, another is trying to get the girl he loves to marry him, another is trying to find her independence and decide what she wants to do. It's basically just a big, long drama.

I loved it and read the whole thing in a day. It's one of the best books I've ever read.

What do these sorts of books come under? So much of sci-fi is big space battles with the universe at stake, and these novels don't fit into that at all. Becky Chamber's Wayfarer Series is the closest thing I've read, and I loved each book in that.

They almost feel like sci fi cozy mysteries, but without the mystery.",0

I have a feeling they were going to keep going but the editor of the last volume Terry Carr passed and no one picked up the torch.

All of the works are short stories, novellas and novelettes.

Poul Anderson, Fritz Leiber, Robert Silverberg, Theodore Sturgeon and Roger Zelazny

**2 works**

Isaac Asimov, James Blish, John W. Campbell, Jr., Arthur C. Clarke, Lester del Rey, Samuel R. Delany, Harlan Ellison, Robert A. Heinlein, C. M. Kornbluth, Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, Clifford D. Simak, Cordwainer Smith and Jack Vance

1109,"The Evils of Unnoticed AbridgementSo I’ve been working my way through the Culture series, alternating with some other things like Guy Gavriel Kay books to keep my reading varied. I’m up to *Matter*, which I got on audiobook through my library on Overdrive’s Libby app. I’ve listened to almost every Culture book to this point on audiobook (all except *The State of the Art*, which I read in print) so the first thing that struck me was that unfortunately Peter Kenny wasn’t reading it. But the narrator they had grew on me, so I was sure it would be fine.

I had read that some people didn’t particularly like *Matter*, but I’d heard the same about *Consider Phlebas* and *Inversions* and I personally was a fan of those (if not so much as *Excession* and *Look to Windward*), so didn’t think much of it. However, by the time I was 4.5 hours into my 5.5 hour audiobook, I had admitted that this book, alone among all the Culture stories, seemed shallow and poorly constructed. Oh well, they can’t all be winners, I supposed.

So, next in publication order is *Surface Detail*, which I’ll want to download. It’s not in my library’s collection, so I’ll have to get it on Audible. For simplicity, I just search “Iain M. Banks” in the search bar. Lo and behold, what is at the top of the list? *Two* versions of the *Matter* audiobook, one 5.5 hours and one 18 hours long. More than two thirds of the audiobook were cut out for reasons unexplained (and not admitted to) when I selected the initial audiobook rental. Seeing this, I knew that my library rental was a heavily abridged version.

Maybe there’s a good reason they did this, but I am pissed that it wasn’t spelled out in any way by my library. The title should be listed as *Matter (abridged)*. Googling it, I saw someone say there was reason to abridge, that the book was fairly boring. I don’t know the truth of that yet, but I will say that I really enjoy the slow sequences of life in and around the Culture or just really any interaction with any Minds or drones. I don’t need guns blazing or even cascading plots to be happy.

I just bought the full version of the *Matter* audiobook, and on my 5+ hour drive tomorrow I’m going to restart it, when I had been expecting to finish the book shortly and begin *Surface Detail*. I have no clue where and how it was abridged, so I guess I’ll find out what parts of the full audiobook I’ve listened to and what parts I haven’t.

I hope that this isn’t a widespread problem in the industry, but I just wanted to vent, and maybe anyone else can post their warnings about books or situations that have hoodwinked them.",0
1110,"Question about Roger Zelazny's This Immortal and its publicationI am about 2/3rds of the way through Roger Zelazny's *Lord of Light,* my first Zelazny novel. I love the book so far and I intend to read some more Zelazny novels this year. This Immortal won the Hugo Award for Best Novel and it's short, so I figured that would be my next pick. When I looked at the Wikipedia page for This Immortal, I saw this section:

""Most, but not all of the cuts made for the serialized version were restored for the first paperback publication by Ace Books and the title was changed by the publisher to This Immortal. Zelazny stated in interviews that he preferred the original eponymous title. The abridged version was novel length at over 47,000 words; the paperback version was over 58,000 words after the cuts were restored. However, it was not until a book club version was published in the 1980s that Zelazny realized that some cuts had not been restored to the book version; thus, earlier publications of This Immortal were still not complete. The abridged magazine version also contains 10 paragraphs of text not in the book version, starting from ""And the long-dormant Radpol was stirring again, but I did not know that until several days later"" and ending with ""The days of Karaghiosis had passed."" Also, the ""Synopsis of Part One"" that appeared in the November 1965 issue of F&amp;SF (immediately prior to Part Two) is written in the first person and contains material about Conrad's character and backstory that is not in the main text of ...And Call Me Conrad nor the 1980s restored version of This Immortal.""

The copy of This Immortal that my library has is the Ace Books edition from 1966, which is 184 pages long. Is this the best/official version of the book, or is it missing content that has been restored in newer editions? Should I just buy a new paperback copy of This Immortal instead?

1112,"Has anyone read Stephen Baxter's Evolution? I enjoyed a lot of it, but one part seemed really illogical and I'm wondering if anyone else thinks so too.In chapter 17, a long shadow, several soldiers wake up from cryogenic stasis at least a thousand years after the end of civilisation, at most a few thousand. They meet the descendants of humans who have become furred, small breasted and significantly less intelligent. It's theorised that this is because intelligence is energy costly and in the immediate aftermath the marginal decrease in food needed would be worth its loss.    
    
But that's ridiculous, is it not? Quite aside from the fact that a few thousand years isn't enough time to select nearly hard enough in a very slow breeding species to achieve those kinds of changes, the idea that those changes would occur makes no sense. I'm not putting intelligence on a pedestal here, but homo sapiens is 'designed' around it, featuring a large a number of otherwise incredibly inefficient features to support it. Weaker muscles for more precise manipulation, dangerous birth to allow for larger heads, very slow maturation process to allow said intelligence to develop - without intelligence to support these are very costly adaptations, and losing intelligence doesn't somehow make these adaptations go away. It would take far, *far* more time than that to gradually lose these features at the same rate as intelligence. Am I missing something here or does this entire section make absolutely no sense?",0

1114,"Tropes of immortalityJust finished the quite pleasant How To Stop Time, by Matt Haig. Not about immortals as much as just extraordinarily long-lived people. A lot to enjoy about it but I was irritated to discover in it yet another example of what I think is an annoying trope of any book involving immortals--the ""I was always in the right place at the right time and met all the right people"" trope. At this point the number of people in fiction who claim to have known, encountered or hung out with Shakespeare, for instance, would be almost as hilariously huge as a peerage made up of all the aristocracy of Regency romance novels. 

Were I so lucky to live thousands of years, I would probably spend a lot of it in exactly the wrong place where no one famous was hanging out. If xers think very little good music has been created since the 90s and their parents think the best literature was written in the 20th century, an immortal would probably think the best writers were on scrolls or stone tablets or what have you. 

In any case, curious to know whether anyone feels similarly.",0

I already read do android dream and man in the high castle in the past and I was actually impressed by the latter.

1126,"Looking for a Science Fiction SubgenreI asked this question on r/sciencefiction and someone suggested I post the question here.

I recently looked at a couple of lists of science fiction subgenres. What seems to be missing is a subgenre that describes science fiction works placed in primitive environments or the distant past. Some short story and novelette examples might include Ted Chiang's ""Tower of Babylon"" or James Blish's ""Surface Tension."" Another example would be stories which take place on another planet where the local beings have primitive technology, or stories on earth about our hominid ancestors. The distinctive quality of such fiction is that it looks to the past rather than the future, but the emphasis is still on science and technology in that context.

I'm curious. Is there a name for this subgenre of science fiction? Thanks for any ideas.

I think, given Jedao's denial of remembering anything about the incident, the most likely explanation is ""possession"" by Kujen, given that we see he can jump bodies more or less instantly.

1128,"Can we talk about the Licanius Trilogy?One of my recent favorite fantasy series is the [Licanius Trilogy by James Islington](https://www.goodreads.com/series/136308-the-licanius-trilogy), which starts with *The Shadow of What Was Lost* and has just been concluded with *The Light of All That Falls*. It's nice to have an epic fantasy series that only required three installments and was actually finished in less than a decade of real time. I'm not finished with the final book yet, but the first two are a solid mix of interesting characters, mystery-box reveals, and intricate magic systems. It also has one of my favorite tropes from epic fantasy: the ancient-yet-advanced civilization that has fallen into ruin, usually in mysterious circumstances that are important to the central story.

However, like any series, it's not without its flaws. The biggest is probably that the story is almost *too* intricate and complex, as shown by the need for a detailed plot and character summary at the beginning of the second and third books. The magic systems are interesting but not very well defined (though they aren't trying to be anything like a Sanderson-esque set of predictable rules, so maybe that is OK). Overall, though, I think the epic-ness is well earned and the central characters are intriguing enough to carry through all three novels without becoming boring or overstaying their welcome.

It feels incredibly underrated and discussed. In this subreddit, for example, there is only a single result when searching for ""Licanius"", and even that appears to be a fluke of the algorithm. Has anyone else read this series? What do you think about it?",0

1132,"Sci-Fi Awards Tracker spreadsheetThere's been a few award tracker spreadsheets floating around so I thought I'd share a master spreadsheet inspired by some of these, that I've been putting together for a while.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kyk6QhZmuLkK9mFTf7wxase\_cHgb6enc3Q5\_CM8QBOI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kyk6QhZmuLkK9mFTf7wxase_cHgb6enc3Q5_CM8QBOI/edit?usp=sharing)

**Award wins and nominations tracked for:**

* Hugo
* Nebula
* Locus SF
* Campbell
* Arthur C. Clarke

**Tracking, Award and Author breakdowns**  
You can mark which books you've read. Award breakdown shows the novels that won and were nominated across each award.

The Summary tab will provide an overview of how many you've read across each award.

Author breakdown will show you the wins and nominations that each author has received, as well as how many you've read.

**Scoring**  
I added a scoring system that I think helps ""normalise"" rankings for older books that were published when there weren't many awards around. You can change the scoring system in the spreadsheet by just choosing ""Regular"" from the drop down at the top of the Score column. That will essentially just give you the percentage of awards the book won.

If you don't like the scoring system at all, you can always just sort by the number of awards won.

**Notes**  
You can read more about the scoring system and sources in the ""Notes"" tab.


Edit: The spreadsheet is something you can make a copy of and keep updated for as long as you like. The intention isn't that you have to rely on me making updates to it in the future. I just wanted to share for anyone else who is like me and likes to keep track of their own things in spreadsheets. I also enjoyed working out a bit of a scoring mechanism for these novels. If you prefer using other sites to track your books then feel free too. This doesn't have to replace anything if you don't want it to.",0
1133,"Question about Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld seriesI am reading an e-version of the Riverworld books for the first time in thirty years and enjoying them as much as I did back then.

One question comes to me. Did Philip Jose Farmer go back and re-edit the series in later years? I distinctly remember from my original read that the cutoff date for the death of everybody on Earth was 1983. But in these versions it's been bumped up to 2080.

There are other changes that seem like modern insertions - someone has taken the trouble to translate miles into kms every time they are mentioned.

The other is the character of the Australian dirigible pilot Jill Gulbirra who seems to have been realigned to voice much more in the way of modern feminist sympathies. I honestly don't recall enough of my original read through. Either PJF was way ahead of his time in regard to perception of women's issues or it feels like someone more recently has gone through and done a re-edit of the text to bring characters into alignment.

Would you kindly help me build a reading list for 2020?I’m hoping to read a lot more sci-fi in 2020 - as many different kinds as possible - so as to slowly discover what I like more. But I’m so new to the genre and there’s so much to cover! I’m seeking your help and expertise and knowledge to build a reading list for 2020! 

At this point I do know that I like big ideas and themes (I was a philosophy major after all, but it doesn’t have to be too alien or outlandish) and well-written, almost literary prose. The latter is harder to find in any genre I know. 

There’s loads I haven’t read (most of Philip K Dick, all of Asimov for instance) but here are some of the ones I’ve read and like. 

- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 
- The Stars My Destination (the themes were interesting even if the writing is just ok) 
- A Canticle for Leibovitz
- Dune (have read the first one only) 
- Ender’s Game 
- 1984
- Illum (have yet to read Olympos)
- Alastair Reynolds short stories (have yet to read any full-length novels by him)

1146,"How many 2019 published SF titles have you read?This is sort-of a follow-up to comments in the [Goodreads](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dv55lr/time_to_vote_in_the_semi_finals_of_the_goodreads/) [Choice](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dyfsn5/the_final_of_the_goodreads_choice_awards_2019_is/) [Awards](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/druhfb/vote_in_the_2019_goodreads_choice_awards/) [threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/ducczw/2019_goodreads_choice_awards_voting_is_on_vote/) a couple of months ago, where several people noted that they had read few or no eligible works.

In one of those threads, I mentioned that I'd seen [a 2017 Clarke Award blog post](https://medium.com/@arthurcclarkeaward/publishers-who-want-new-readers-must-challenge-their-genre-boundaries-3c170d8b32b2), which quoted some research that SF readers not reading many {current-year} titles is actually pretty common (my emphasis):

&gt; We were also fascinated to see that the majority of readers in our sample were not only reading 50+ books a year but also buying 50+ books a year. But here’s the rub — of those 50 books being read a year, **only an average of five of those titles were read in the actual year of their publication**. You can count on reviews, blogs, tweets and so much more, but they are a groundswell, not a spike. In an industry that focuses all the weight of its attention on publication day before moving on to the next release, this is something of a problem.

Given that 2019 has just ended, it seems like an ideal time to do a similar, but very informal, survey here, so let me ask: **how many SF books published in 2019 have you read?**  My guess - based on things like what people post in [the monthly wrap-up threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/eio4jj/month_of_december_wrapup_optional_2019_personal/) - is that the average for this sub would be similar to that reported in that Clarke Award blog post, but it'd be interesting to see if it's not.

To kick things off, here are my stats for last year:

* Overall I read 59 books, of which 46 were SF&amp;F.  (The rest all being non-fiction.)
* Of those, 9 were titles first published in 2019.  This was actually a big jump from previous years, due to me deliberately making more of an effort to keep to up-to-date with the latest in the field.  By comparison, I only read 4 titles published in 2018 that same year, although I did catch up with another 6 of them this year.
* Of those 9, all but one were library loans - the size of my TBR pile means that I don't feel much inclination to rush out to buy new titles, unless they're on sale.  (I've got over a dozen 2019 titles that I picked up when they were cheap on the UK Kindle store, but have yet to get round to reading.  Perhaps I'm a bad fan/reader for not supporting authors/publishers by buying books when they're new/full price?)

NB#1: the above numbers are via [some code I wrote](https://github.com/JohnSmithDev/GRAnalysis) to produce stats based on a CSV export from Goodreads, which is more effort than I'd reasonably expect anyone else to go to - posting just a rough guesstimate figure would be more than good enough.

NB#2: I'm only interested in the total number of 2019 books you've read, not a list of the actual titles you read.  (Feel free to link to a Goodreads Year-in-Review or Reading Challenge page, or similar list of what you've read though.)

1147,"Looking for some book/author recommendations, soft/semi-soft current day/near future Sci Fi...other criteria inside.So I'm trying to get into reading much much more as one of my new years resolutions.

I'm looking for some current day or near future sci fi that is either ""soft"" or ""semi-soft"".  I don't mind technical explanations, as long as they aren't a text book, just give me something that sounds semi-plausible and move on.

.

The second and more important thing and one some will no doubt consider ""low brow"", I want the story to focus on the story, I'm not interested in a deep introspective of the human condition or ridiculous character melodrama set in a scifi setting.  Now obviously I want the chracters fleshed out to more than cardboard cutouts...but honestly not much more.  I hate books that are 10 pages of character drama to 1 page of ""the main story""

.

I generally like stories that are current day and one scifi thing happens, for example the last story I read like that was Flash Forward by Robert Sawyer, I pretty much enjoyed that, especially the ""Mosaic Project"" parts.

1158,"How much scientific detail and technical explanation do you prefer in your space opera stories?Looking at my reading patterns for sci-fi, it seems that I usually gravitate more towards ""soft"" style sci fi/space opera, with some basis in reality but a lot of hand-waving going on. Especially for stories that are more about the characters and the narrative, i.e. Hyperion, Dune, The Expanse (although it does have *some* rigorous science), Vorkosigan saga, Revelation Space etc.

1162,"Help identifying short story about two scientists competing to unlock antigravity technologyI remember reading a short story when I was younger. It was about two scientists, both apparently equally brilliant but in subtly different ways. One was brash and flamboyant with a flair for publicity, prone to outbursts of extreme creativity and genius. One was a stolid, withdrawn, deep man with a reputation for taking extremely long times to come up with his insights, but having them be absolutely brilliant when he did. I forget the initial premise, but they wind up in a bet of some sort as to who can discover and demonstrate anti-gravitational technology first. The flashy guy nominally invents it first and organizes a big press event to unveil his invention, which he built into a billiard table. He invites the stolid scientist to shoot a ball into some field he created at the center of the table to demonstrate that the ball will no longer be subject to the force of gravity. The stolid, slow-thinking scientist eyes the table for a minute and shoots the ball, which immediately travels at interstellar speed directly through the flashy scientist, killing him instantly. There is much debate about this outcome among the public (in the story).  


I remember reading this story as a child and I'd like to read it again, but I can't remember what it's called or who wrote it. It might have been Asimov? But I don't know. Does this synopsis sound familiar to anyone? Anyone know what story I'm remembering?",0

I am 99% certain it was a trilogy.  It was in the adult section of the public library, so not a kiddies book (but not ""adult"" in the ""adult"" sense).

The basic plot was that slug-like aliens come to Earth in the near future, under false friendly pretenses.  The slugs were more or less human-sized, and were present in, I think, 3 ""races"" - brown (most common, the soldiers I think), black, and grey.  Humans at the time used energy beam weapons that had no effect on the slugs because of the slugs' force field armour.  Eventually someone discovered that physical weapons were not deterred by the force fields; I particularly remember them adopting old-style (for their era) guns like we use today.  I don't recall much more.

I am not sure if I'm confusing the story with the V series, but I recall they were after something, either humans for slaves or water or both.

Thanks!

1166,"Looking for a new book.I've just finished reading a book that was pretty satisfying and I'm looking to replicate the exact same experience I've just had.  Since we all know the best way to search for new books is with a topical laundry list, I wondered if people might help, since that seems pretty popular around here.  

The book must have an early middle aged male protagonist, preferably with a sexy female sidekick that excels in either engineering, programming, or martial arts.  It must be space opera, but the weapons used within the space opera must be a mix of melee and ranged, with strategic concerns mostly revolving around the use of biological ordinance.  There can be no lasers present in the book, neither pistols nor cannons, though plasma weaponry is OK.  There must be triad of major villains - no more, no less - all of whom must have at least one POV chapter dedicated to making them sympathetic villains.  At least one of them must have a physical deformity, preferably a limp, and one must be mentally ill, but in a dramatic 'Hannibal Lecter' way, as real mental illness is too depressing.  The action must take place on no more than two planets, and there must be a plot twist approximately 80% of the way through the novel.  Light romance and illusive sex is mandatory.  The names of the majority of the characters in the book must follow a pattern in which the first name is longer than the last.  Finally, the book must end in either total victory or total defeat for the protagonists, the latter only acceptable if it leads into a sequel - the only indeterminancy acceptable is quantum, and then only if it powers a Doomsday Weapon.

Beyond all that, I'm pretty flexible.  The ability of the author to compose a coherent paragraph, the prose styling and its implementation, how much the book challenges me on pretty much any level, authorial intention and ambition, and all the rest are less important that my checklist and my need to repeat the same experience over and over.  I read all kinds of things!  Thanks in advance!",0

1205,"Anybody else find Dennis E. Taylor's ""All These Worlds"" (Bobiverse #3) unsatisfying? [Spoilers!]I've just finished the trilogy and, while it was never more than lightweight froth with an obvious author-insert, it was fun enough for what it was. But I found the third book harder going than the other two, and ultimately the least satisfying.

Firstly, there were a couple of plot threads that I just didn't care about. Most notably everything on Poseidon. I found all those chapters to be a drag.

But, more to the point, they're a perfect example of one of the things I found off about the book as a whole - the plot just sort of meanders around a bit without really doing much. The whole plot is the resident Bob saying ""well, I'm not actually going to fight back"", until it goes ""well, I did fight back and won easily"". Which...okay.

I felt the same about Bob with Archimedes. Everything with the Deltans seemed to be just marking time until Archimedes died in order to give Bob the impetus to get on with his life.  The Brazilian replicant comes back for no reason and then is just squashed with a slap.

But my biggest complaint is that the resolutions to plots seemed to be unearned. I partly mentioned that with the Poseidon stuff. Bridget absolutely does not want to be digitised at all...until she suddenly does, off-camera. And then the court case is won, not by anything clever anybody did, but just because that's how it was. And Bridget is saved. Again, not by anything clever, but just by a Bob getting to the stasis pod first. The Others near Sol are defeated, not by a clever strategy based on their knowledge of their behaviour (like their agoraphobia, or exploiting their incomplete knowledge of the human race), but by them making a stupid mistake and using the nuclear bombs in a deus ex machina fashion. Moving planets to defeat them at home was set up earlier, but not the effect that throwing a couple of planets in to the sun would have, and the whole thing happened in a ""oh, by the way, while all that was going on, this also all occurreded off-camera"" fashion.

And so on. None of the plots really felt like they were of any consequence, and none felt like they were really resolved properly.

I do have other problems with the series as a whole but, as I said at the start, I was okay overlooking them because the ride was a decent enough distraction in a pulp-y sort of way, but most of the third book felt like spinning wheels in order to get to a rushed ending without proper set-up.",0

1209,"The Return of the Incredible Exploding ManI do not see any discussion of this here ?

I like the author's work quite a bit but was very disappointed with this - the pacing is just odd.. with a lot of the plot crammed into the last 20% - almost like originally this was going to be multiple books but he gave up on the idea and so just stuck all his ideas in the last section. Moreover the 'twist' is obvious so you are simply waiting for it to happen.

Furthermore although this might seem like it knocks off the origin of Doctor Manhattan, it also seems to borrow a lot from the 90s version of Solar man of the atom.

1216,"December Wrap-UpSo I have PrintSF to thank for a good chunk of my reading this year. Basically I went through a fair few of the various lists I could find here on ‘must-read’ sci-fi, and started working my way through a few. Here’s some that I read this year, and maybe if people wanna put what they picked up to read thanks to PrintSF I’d love to see. Or even better yet recommendations based on what I’ve got through!

Hyperion Cantus: So I had heard a fair bit about this before coming to this subreddit but you guys convinced me to take the plunge. Well worth it, although I haven’t taken a look at the sequel yet. 

Solaris: There was a lot of mixed views on this but I ended up loving it. I can understand why people would consider it a little unexciting, but the entire concept just fascinated me from the very start. 

Ancillary Justice: This was another high recommendation but for the life of me I couldn’t get into it. I did get to the end, but I found it pretty tricky to follow. I don’t know, maybe it needs a second chance?

Exhalation: This collection of short stories was a nice little break from larger adventures. Kind of a mixed bag, and sadly one of the longest of the stories was one of the most dull for me. But the story for which the collection is named was fairly excellently crafted. Lots of lovely ideas in here.

Children of Time: I was a little wary of getting into this because I imagined for some reason it would be hard to follow with different alien races and people and so on. But then it was a surprise hit. Presented something very much out there in a very factual realistic way. I know there’s a sequel, is it worth a look?

The Three-Body-Problem and The Dark Forest: I’m actually in the middle of the dark forest now and enjoying quite a bit. The main issues I had with these two are the characters. I slip in and out of who it is I’m reading about, plus none of them really interest me much. But on the flip side, the stories and ideas presented definitely make up for that. 

Dark Matter: More of a fast-paced thriller Dan Brown kinda vibe here. Was a bit of a hodge-podge of other books and movies while failing to  say anything new. Probably liked this one the least. 

That’s all that I recall at the moment, but just thanks to all the cool conversations and recommendations here and have a great holidays or christmas or whatever!",0

1225,"“A Deepness in the Sky” and ADHDIn Vernor Vinge’s novel *A Deepness in the Sky*, the bad guys’ principal tool for dominating their population is “Focus.” A “Focused” person has had their brain tweaked so that they can only concentrate on a single topic, making them not only far more productive in that area than their regular peers, but incapable of rebellion against the regime.

The thought crossed my mind: from the point of view of a reader with ADHD, could Focus be seen as a parody of what it’s like to be neurotypical? (I’m not saying that Vinge intended this, but: [Death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author), film at 11.)

PS: I know that one aspect of ADHD is a phenomenon called “hyperfocus,” but that’s when someone focuses on the *wrong* thing.

1232,"Happy Apocalypses?Hey all. I have a particular itch for a certain kind of story I'm not sure what to call. The best example I can think of is the manga [Record of a Yokohama Shopping Trip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D) - in which seas have risen, populations have fallen and the end of the world as we know it has come and gone... but quality of life and connections to community have gone up in many ways. The step down from complexity to simplicity was probably devastating... but all that's long since over; people enjoy a slower pace of life and closer relationships now that they don't have to compete to survive.    

Margaret Atwood's Year of the Flood comes to mind here, too. It's a hard read, but the Gardeners' culture stands as a healthy contrast to the sickness of the failing global civilization. The end of the world means all the latter's cruelty, dehumanization and ruination of the planet get washed away.     

I'm more interested in stories that take place long after the washing, of building new kinds of societies in the ashes of one that didn't deserve to keep going, anyway. Less the lament of Saint Leibowitz, more the hopefulness of The Dispossessed. I don't want tales of rugged individualism, but of societies, cultures and communities that learn lessons from the failed dystopias they grow out of. Kim Stanley Robinson's New York 2140 would also be a good example of what I'm looking for. It doesn't have to be a step down from complexity to simplicity - I agree with the latter sections of Schismatrix that there's a danger in viewing simplicity as inherently better or more moral. Stories of how we held onto the complex parts worth keeping... but there have to be dead husks thrown away, whether by choice or catastrophe. A world ended and a better one built in its place; maybe not improved in every way, but not a total loss. The things that make people good or interesting should remain after everything else floats off in a Deluge.  

What comes to mind for you?",0
1233,"Brian Aldiss's GreybeardI recently finished reading Brian Aldiss's novel *Greybeard*. Published in 1964, it has the same premise as P. D. James's novel *Children of Men*, which it may well have served as an inspiration for. Having read both novels, I personally think Aldiss's work is better. *Greybeard* simply feels more real. I can actually imagine the world Aldiss describes coming about should human reproduction ever stop.

Furthermore, the novel has more emotional resonance than *Children of Men*. Aldiss states in a prologue to a recent edition of the novel that he wrote the book after having lost custody of his children in a divorce. In several passages, you can feel the pain of his grief as he describes the emotional impact of living without children.",0

So far (started it today) I'm on the third chapter. It's really good and, I don't know, maybe my bar for quality is low. After my last post here I'm finding that it's a lot harder to appease other, more prolific, readers than me. One thing I don't like about it is, and I suppose this gripe will never go away with these books, is that it feels like young adult fiction. Er, no, it feels like young adult fiction that's trying to not be young adult fiction. Or maybe the other way around - it's normal fiction that's trying to appeal to both kids and adults. Because it has extremely adult concepts and political thinking, but it's character is a 16 year old.


Katniss's age, though, is tempered by the maturity that is required of her in that kind of situation. I just ... What would have been so wrong with writing it so that tribute age range was, say, 16-24, instead of 12-18? What would be so wrong with having Katniss be a little older?

1239,"My year in books, tiny reviews for the 19 books I read in 2019.So here is a short “my year in books” for 2019, I’ve read a mix of scifi and fantasy this year. With a clear outlier with Stephen Hawking. If there is only time to read 1 book from this list I would recommend you to read House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds. There are so many concepts I truly loved, that this would be the best book I’ve read this year.

**7 / 10: Charles Stross: The Labyrinth Index (Laundry Files, #9)**  
I think Stross has worked himself into a corner in earlier books. It feels like a TV show that continued for a season too long. However, this is still a solid 7, but relative to the other laundry files maybe a 6.

**7 / 10: Claire North: The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August**  
I liked it. Well written characters and an interesting take on time travel.

**8 / 10: Martha Wells:  (The Murderbot Diaries, 2 - 4) Artificial Condition, Rogue Protocol, Exit Strategy**  
I’m going to group these together because they are quite short each. Finally some closure for murderbot. I think murderbot is one of the best defined android characters in any book I’ve read. Please read the whole series.

**10 / 10: Alastair Reynolds: House of Suns**  
Loved it, there are so many things going on. With a cool intertwined origin story and it plays out on such a massive scale (both time and space wise) that it’s just mind boggling. Did I say I loved it? 

**9 / 10: Daniel O'Malley: The Rook (The Checquy Files, #1), Stiletto (The Checquy Files, #2)**  
First book is AWESOME. Second book is also good, but just not on the awesome level the first one was. Please read these before becoming disappointed by the tv show. 

**7 / 10: Becky Chambers: (Wayfarers, 1 - 3) The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, A Closed and Common Orbit, Record of a Spaceborn Few**  
I’m conflicted on these. I usually read books that have some build up, action and, preferably, some closure. These books don’t really fit. And I only realized it after reading the whole series. The character and world building of these books is just stellar. Just don’t expect too much action in part 2 and 3. Also, they share the same universe and some characters, but you can read them in any order and nothing will be spoiled or lost.

**5 / 10: Steve McHugh: Crimes Against Magic (Hellequin Chronicles, #1)**  
I saw this on my goodreads list and actually forgot I read this. Looking back I do remember the story to some degree. Skip it.

**8 / 10: Stephen Hawking: Brief Answers to the Big Questions**  
Good book, learn some actual science by reading this.

**7 / 10: Iain M. Banks: Consider Phlebas**  
I liked the world building and the actual concepts itself were cool. The book itself was quite boring however.

**9 / 10: V.E. Schwab: (Villains, 1 &amp; 2 ) Vicious, Vengeful**  
Good memorable characters, excellent pace and interesting plot. Finished these together in 10 days. (While I usually take at least 2 weeks per book!)

**7 / 10: Terry Pratchett: Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch**  
I listened to this as an audiobook in the months after my second son was born. I think the combination of listening in short stints (20 minutes max) and being kind of sleep deprived made this book a bit hard to follow. I like the main characters, but the overall plot just didn’t really work for me.

**10 / 10: George R.R. Martin: Tuf Voyaging**  
As probably one of the few people left that hasn’t seen or read anything from misterrr Martin… I must say I truly loved this book. Tuf is, and will forever be, my hero. He is just an awesome character. The stories in this book all have a similar layout so there will be no true surprises.",0

There's quite a wide range of things I'm interested in designing which include any of the following:
- gritty almost cyberpunk-like city, the type of thing you would see in Blame! or Biomega manga  or a bit Blade Runner ish
- places that have sci-fi-esque temples (like star wars old republic type stuff)
- streets with crashed ships/vehicles, decrepit buildings, or a space shipyard maybe (if anyone has played Fallen Order something like Bracca) 
- Other settings that have the same sort of vibe
Basically settings that are more gritty and weathered with sci-fi elements rather than super futuristic and sleek looking and would give me something interesting to design. Oh and also I'd rather it be in a different planet to Earth

1243,"Looking for short stories or novels where the science of Quantum Mechanics plays a significant role in the story. Any recommendations?I'm mostly looking for shorter fiction on this subject: short stories, novellas, novelettes, and or short novels. **No large novels or novel series, please.**

Any story where the central premise or scientific conceit involves quantum mechanics (QM) in a significant way counts. This could either be philosophical (as in exploring the different possible interpretations of quantum physics), or technological (i.e. QM is crucial to some technology used in the story). But the science itself must play a role in the story. For example, a story that merely features nuclear weapons would not count -- unless the quantum physics aspect of nuclear science is relevant to the story.

I've had it in my head I was going to write a very soft Sci-Fi novel. Leave things unexplained, keep an element of fantasy to it without going full Science Fantasy, have it take place millions of years in the future. Reading recent books though, it seems like the taste is mostly towards the harder sci-fi. The only well-received and really well-written very soft sci-fi I've read recently was ""This Is How You Lose The Time War"" and that seems like it fills a niche I could never pull off.

I definitely admit that it’s a wildly original set of short stories. No argument from me on its quality. Curious though, what sci-fi book do you wish made this list instead?! (Disclaimer: I like these lists because it exposes great authors to more mainstream audiences.)

Here’s the blurb: “Many of the nine deeply beautiful stories in this collection explore the material consequences of time travel. Reading them feels like sitting at dinner with a friend who explains scientific theory to you without an ounce of condescension. Each thoughtful, elegantly crafted story poses a philosophical question; Chiang curates all nine into a conversation that comes full circle, after having traversed remarkable terrain.

I can't tell if this is intentional or just bad writing, but the book won the Hugo so I assume it can't be terrible...

Clearly some of the characters speak this way because they're spending lots of time in the 1940s, but that's not true for all of them.

So, I guess my question is: is there some in-book explanation for why everyone speaks in such an anachronistic way? (Not to mention the fact that people have secretaries, call each other ""Mr. Whatever"" and there are no mobile phones, or internet...) I guess if I can believe that these are intentional -- like it's a parallel universe where somehow the UK got stuck in the 1960s -- then it'll be fine, but if it's just a writer who doesn't know how to write dialogue for people from another country, then I'm not sure I can bear it...",0
1259,"Tech Anachronisms - Vorkosigan SagaSo, in light of Bujold being named a SFWA Grand Master, I decided to delve into Vorkosigan. It's delightful space opera. 

But one thing I keep having trouble shaking is the technological anachronisms. Horses and plasma rifles are a mixture created for plot and style, but... it's hard to imagine places being unable to generate electricity or have comms in a society that is terraforming and interstellar. Like, they can only have electricity if a power sat is installed... etc.

In other books (not Bujold) this pops up too. Heinlein's Moon is a Harsh Mistress has a tonne of this sort of thing. It was written to be predictive in terms of tech, and failed. But in that case, you can read it in context: this is a prediction of future tech at the time of writing.  And it can be read and enjoyed in that context.

So I sort of understand that she has intentionally created feudal backwaters because it fits the tone. But really, the peasant lady had to walk four days to throw herself at the mercy of her feudal lord?

I like that his writing is easy to read, easy to pick back up if I have to put it down for a day or two, and completely riveting as far as I’ve read. I don’t like that he uses “presently” so often and I don’t care for how abruptly his books end (definitely NOT a deal breaker for me).

I have a ridiculously long reading list right now. I know I can’t read an entire series of books in a row. For example, I read the first two books of The Expanse series before I had to take a break and then I read two more. Now I’m kinda “meh” on the series. The Mars Trilogy is one book and then a long break until the next one. I’ve put Green Mars down twice and moved on to something else before finishing. 

Without spoilers, are the rest of the Ringworld series worth reading shortly after the first?

I found this by accident a year or so ago, and have been hooked ever since. The first book is already complete, and author is almost done with the second book + multiple sidestories etc.

The story, without spoilers, deals with the aftermath of humanity's almost complete extinction at the hands of an alien conqueror race. The only survivors are effectively brainwashed menial labor.  And it has a very... unique protagonist.

There is a much longer description i can post, but it can spoil some fun for you, so i'd recommend you just go in and give it a try. However, if you want to know, see below for *minor* spoilers



* Minor Spoilers below

The Last Angel refers to Nemesis One, the AI-controlled warship that was created in the last years of the war that humanity lost, as a ""last-ditch"" effort to protect earth. It barely avoided destruction after humanity lost, and has been drifting out for hundreds or thousands of years, recovering, and watching how last remnants of humanity are consumed by the Compact (alien federation that conquered them).

I'm really looking for some books with some good fleet battles in space.  Politics is great too.  Some strong characters.  But I want there to be some space fighting.  Space marines are fine.  But not only space marines.  But space warfare too.  Here is what I have read recently:

1. Swarm series by BV Larson.  I liked the fleet nature.  I liked how they had to build it up and use alien technology to make more ships/defenses.  I really liked all that.  The fleet battles especially later on the in the series was great too.  I didn't really get into the sequel series, but overall I really enjoyed this despite some flaws.
2. Skippy the magnificent, er I mean the Expedition series.  I'm current up to date in this one as well.  I have enjoyed it for the most part.  But one series with an asshole AI is enough for me.  I don't think I could handle another one!  I enjoyed the series, but I really wish it had actual fleet battles instead of all the sneaky traps.  I understand from a narrative perspective why its the way it is.  I'm excited for the next book because I think it should have more fleet battles than previous books.  I also want to wait for the audible so even though it comes out soon I enjoy the narrator too much to read it.  So really its going to be a couple months before I get to listen to the next book in this series.
3. Starship Mage/Red Falcon series.  Currently up to date on these.  The fleet battles the last couple books were great.  More of this type of thing.
4. The expanse.  Currently on book 3.  Not a lot of fleet battles so far.
5. Revelation space - I'm having a hard time getting into this.  Its a bit dry.  So far no space battles but I'm not very far into it.  Have tried to get into it several times without any luck.
6. Old Man's war - Read it. Enjoyed it.   Honestly can't remember much if any fleet battles.  I think it was  mostly marines/ground warfare.
7. BAttle cruiser series by BV larson.  A lot of space battles.  Really liked it.   More like this.
8. Collapsing empire series  by John Scalzi - really enjoyed the politics/writing.  Didn't have much space battles.

Some observations:

* No obvious correlation is seen between the final ranking and the popularity of either the authors or the books.
* Only weak relation is seen between the final ranking and the Goodreads Average Rating - I had to draw a trend line of the latter to see there really is a trend.
* ""Series Survivor"" theory is demostrated - the top two Avg Ratings in this list are the the latest books in a series with the biggest numbers (#8 and #5 in their respective series).
   * ""Readers tend to rate later books in series higher because the ones who rate them low have dropped them already.""

Edit: forgot to mention one point:

* Winners #2 through #5 got much more votes than ratings - I mean really MUCH MORE on the same website. Who are so many of those who don't bother to rate a book but go out of their way to vote?

BTW:

There have been some worries that books which were published later in the year come with some disadvantages in this voting because they have less time to get known and read.

1287,"What does the Three Body Problem trilogy say about the experience of living under an authoritarian regime? *SPOILERS*&amp;#x200B;

A post prompted by another current thread re Cixin Liu, specifically a comment about his ""friendly stance on Chinese dictatorship"":

A big element within TBP is how the Trisolaran's do not have an internal dialogue, thoughts and speech are one and the same (i.e. they have no concept of privacy). This gives humans a distinct if slightly fallible advantage in that they can defy the omniscient sophons by simply concealing their inner motives, the thinking behind the Wallfacer strategy that can only be thwarted by the traitorous human Wallbreakers.

At one crucial point of the trilogy the tragic Yun Tianming, reconstituted from a cryogenically frozen brain by the Trisolarans, is allowed to communicate directly with Cheng Xin so ingeniously shares information that could save humanity by concealing vital details as metaphors in three fairy tales (claiming these were a shared memory from their childhood).

Yun Tianming is able to tell stories to outsiders that conceal a critique of his captors that if he was more explicit would lead to certain death.

After reading the trilogy I found myself quite haunted by this element of the story and suspect Cixin Liu has far more in common with Yun Tianming than the Trisolarans.",0

1293,"Finished Cixin Liu's 'Ball Lightning' earlier this weekI know there's a controversy about the author due to his friendly stance on Chinese dictatorship. Anyway, the Three Body Problem series and The Wandering Earth collection belong to the best of contemporary Science Fiction I've read so I was curious about 'Ball Lightning'.

'Ball Lightning' is a stand alone novel which (as the author explains in the afterword) can be seen as somewhat of a prequel to the aforementioned trilogy. It is about a Chinese scientist driven to understand the national phenomenon of ball lightning, which traumatically incinerated his parents on his fourteenth birthday. On his quest he crosses the paths of many scientists who failed with 'ball lightning', the military, ex-soviet scientists and makes breakthrough discoveries. Eventually ball lightning is weaponized.

China in this novel is in a war. It's not declared with whom but it is likely the USA due to some remarks about the most powerful navy in the world. All science in this case serves the war machinery and a female major is playing an important role here in using ball lightning to turn the tide on the battlefield. Ball lightning is described as 'macro electrons' and later the 'macro nuclei' are found and used to create a macro atom bomb, so powerful it sends large parts of China back into the agricultural age  due to eating computer chips in a large area.

I found certain remarks of the outstanding physicist character Ding Yi mindbending: With the macro world a brain could have to size of the solar system. Also there's a twist when technology moves to quantum mechanics, which makes the novel relevant today and explains it to non-scientists like me.

All in all the book is certainly worth the read, smaller in scale to the trilogy (as expected) but characterized by the same level of Liu's technical descriptions which I always enjoy. I would recommend it to Liu readers without a doubt.",0

1296,"[Discussion]Whatever happened to John Scalzi?So I was looking through book suggestions for some SF and everywhere I went I kept seeing Old Man's War(A personal fav) but nothing else by Scalzi.

His new books never get recommended and after how good the first 4 OMW were I am a little shocked by that. Has anyone read his newer stuff, I confess the only other books of his I read was redshirts and fuzzy nation, neither of which were for me.

After his passing he went to a kind of after-death nexus where he was told that he had his choice of afterlife from various different cultures, or he had the choice of no afterlife. It turns out that these afterlifes are simulations designed to keep the mind occupied as these people are slowly digested by some kind of worm-like being. This process takes centuries, but is highly pleasurable, and the man has the choice of going into a simulation or simply experiencing the digestion. It is not a secret - everyone knows. It was not in a major sci-fi or fiction magazine - it was on its own site, like The Egg by Andy Weir. The tone was highly optimistic, and the afterlife itself was viewed as a paradise in the story.",0

1300,"90s(?) Sci-Fi Collection With Green Spheres and Colorful Big Bird AliensI believe that it was a collection, anyway. I need your help, guys. Anything you could do would be appreciated: It was from the early to mid 90s and one of the stories involved a woman staying at a cabin during a dark and stormy night. A green sphere appears (or maybe crashes?) and the woman is very afraid of it. After a time skip, however, they become good friends reminiscing about their first encounter. I believe they also met with other aliens at some point.The green sphere acts as a mentor for the woman, who works as an agent for an interstellar organization. It might have been the first in a series of short stories.
The second story involved a student exchange program between an alien species (looking like green Big Birds) and humans. They have just initiated first contact, and the narrator only learns that she is part of the program after going back to her dorm (she's a college student) and finding her new alien roommate in a towel after taking a shower. Both species want to make a good first impression, but the alien species is far more communal than humans normally are.",0

1311,"[Spoilers] Just finished Dune, a question about the sequelsHonestly I was a little let down after the beginning of the book, the setup with the Harkonnen vs. Atreides rivalry and their respective scheming was very interesting and engaging to me and it slowed down a lot after Leto dies. Especially towards the end where Paul is just sort of an arrogant god amongst men and everything just resolves itself. I mostly wish the Barron's death wasn't so anticlimactic and that Gurney had a better part in... well anything in the second half of the book.

Anyway, I still enjoyed it just not enough to instantly jump into one of the other entries in the series. So I came to ask a few questions since I'd rather not google them for fear of spoilers. Are the other books generally considered better, worse, or on par with Dune? Is it more following Paul around as he stomps everything because he is a god amonst men now? (I get that him being super awesome is kind of his role, but I liked his character way more when he was more human and less prophet) 

Do other characters play a part in the story and does Gurney get a satisfying role to play or conclusion to his story? Or is it like the Polity and Culture novels where the other installments might not have anything to do with each other besides sharing a universe and the occasional crossover?",0

1313,"SPOILER: Blindsight: Who was more intelligent? Who ""won""?SPOILERS!!!!



So, at the end of the book, I think that the match was a draw, right? *Theseus* could send back data, it destroyed Rorschach - but the scramblers also got their victory, they figured out humans to the last nerves, they learnt how humans behaved. So the two parties - the Captain and the scramblers - were equal at first glance. 


But here is the thing: the Captain achived a draw against all odds. It was separated from the rest of mankind, fought without its quantum computing facilities (Sarasti mentions them being shut down due to the magnetic field), it barely had any hardware, it had lower tech, managed to feed the scramblers false data (the two that made back to Rorschach in pieces did not deliver any news about what they were up against) and commanded a crew that was practically useless against the aliens as it turned out. It also kept its antimatter reserves secret most likely (Rorschach would  not attack it if it knew I think) , made everyone, most likely the scramblers too, believe that Sarasti was running the mission. And in the end, it even managed to get Siri home, to let him escape from a system where the aliens's hardware outnumbered them by many magnitudes of mass and advancement. 


So the question raises itself: Was the Captain more intelligent as the scramblers? Because when I re-read the book, I started to have a feeling that the true superintelligence in the books was not the scramblers, but the Captain, the other non-self aware entity.",0

&gt;The air grew chill and damp, and the servants brought hot, bittersweet drinks in handled bowls. “Xhai-style,” Fosyf informed me.

Timothy Zahn famously wrote of Luke drinking hot chocolate in the *Thrawn* trilogy; some fans were upset that he included a plant from Earth in Star Wars. While Earth isn’t featured in the *Ancillary* series, tea is regularly consumed and is described in a way that’s consistent with the plant that we know.

Come to think of it, the *Ancillary Sword* shares a lot of elements with *Thrawn*, but I’m on mobile so I can’t include the spoiler tag. Highly recommend the series, it explores some interesting concepts.",0

But wow! I haven't finished it yet, but imo, it blows the other old SF away...so far. Most classic SF is pretty predictable and (I hate this term) ""dated"". But unbelievably, this book seems like it could have been written recently.

It is almost nonstop thrilling action. And the tech and ideas aren't the typical corny tropes I expect from 1950's SF. And the protagonist being an extremely brutish vindictive person is also a surprise.

I’m also currently reading Becky Chambers’ newest novella, **To Be Taught, If Fortunate**. It’s good but hasn’t blown me away or anything.

I've also heard good things and plan on knocking out the following:
**Salvation Lost** by Peter F. Hamilton (I loved the first one),
**Recursion** by Blake Crouch,
**Waste Tide** by Chen Quifan,
**Finder** by Suzanne Palmer,
**Ancestral Night** by Elizabeth Bear,
**A Memory Called Empire** by Arkady Martine

(I’m only 3 books deep into the Expanse but I’ve heard that’s still going strong and only 2 books done with Red Rising and heard the fifth book is great too. I’ve read Luna: New Moon and still would very much like to finish this trilogy out as well.)

What other titles am I missing? Is there anything I should prioritize? I’ve been waiting for my audiobook library copy of A Memory Called Empire for two months now! I’m really excited to start that one though.",0

1342,"Just finished Gateway - Turns out I enjoy Sci-fi booksI just finished Gateway, by Frederik Pohl.

I was gripped and fascinated by the main character. The mystery and fear coming from the main theme of the story had me coming back for more and excited for the next time I could continue reading it. I also love the psychological aspects to it, too.

I find it very difficult to read books. I have a few lying on my book shelf that I had intended to read at some point, but I never got around to it.

I believe that space Sci-fi is something I'm really interested in.

Don't hiss at me, but I really enjoyed the Mass Effect novels when they came out (4th one wasn't too good - different author), the lore, characters, and the imagery it put into my head.

Fast forward about 7 years and I've just read Gatway; where it clicked in my mind that I must be drawn in by the Sci-fi genre.

How would you classify Gateway? Is it strictly Sci-fi? I'm interested in reading quality books in the same genre.

I want to continue with the rest of the Heechee series, and have now just ordered the older title by Pohl, The Space Merchants, before I continue the saga.

Any recommendations would be great, as I find that reading books that capture my imagination and draw me in give me a different and more special experience compared to watching TV or playing video games.",0

1353,"Trying to find: Time travel short story in which the hero rides around in a mechanical TriceratopsSo, a friend and I have this ongoing joke based on a truly awful short story we read online a couple of years ago, but now we can't find it anymore. We're losing our minds.

Here's what we remember:

* It was a time travel story
* The hero had traveled back to the Cretaceous, though we can't remember why
* Somehow he ran into and saved a pair of small, charming children
* He constantly called the little girl ""pumpkin"" (that's the joke - calling one another ""pumpkin"" in otherwise dead-serious or unexpected situations and making each other crack up)
* He rode around in a mechanical Triceratops (it had a name), and at one point let the little boy drive it
* We think it ended with some kind of time travel plot twist involving the little girl becoming his wife, or similar (yikes)

1354,"Books Like Battlestar Galactica (2003) and Stargate Atlantis (2004)These two shows are my all-time favorites. They really are quite similar in what they explore.

* Setting - The Battlestar is breathtaking and extremely well realized, but I do prefer the lost city of the Ancients, because of the deep sense of wonder I felt every time I discovered a new part of it. Both used their setting very creatively in the story they told.
* Mystery - In Battlestar and you have the mystery surrounding the Cylons and &gt;!Angels and Gods,!&lt; in Atlantis there are the Wraith and Ancients and the galaxy they left behind.
* Characters - I loved how much I connected with the people! The people on the Battlestar felt more real, the ones on Atlantis more fun (which I prefer changes depending on my mood).",0

\- sorry -   


I read a short story quite awhile back in a SCI-fi anthology and I'm looking for the title so that I can re-read and share with friends. 

The main point is that an alcoholic and nearly washed out researcher is given a second chance and he decides to replicate the double blind study but test it with different animals to see at which point the observer effect kicks in - and the results and after-effects have consequences for everyone.

1356,"I just finished Beggars in Spain by Nancy Kress, a great example of a story that makes one change (some people don’t sleep!) and then fully explores the ramifications to society over time. What makes this type of narrative work for you or not?By one change, I don’t mean there was a nuclear apocalypse or we colonized the solar system, but something more subtle or singular like in Kress’ book. Some people are modified to not sleep, that leads to a stratification of society, sleepless gain economic power over time, etc etc.

While it’s not perfect this book worked for me because:

- It was still character driven and the story was driven by people’s existence in this new world and the world was explored through their stories
- It took its time and showed the intergenerational changes that might occur over a longer period, not just jamming in vast changes in an unrealistically quick timeframe
- It showed all sides to societal change, and have those differences change over time too: political, economic, technological, philosophical

It really only fell flat for me by portraying the groups in a fairly monolithic way outside of the main characters, it would have been interesting to show a more variety in the broader social groupings.

Not particularly interested in recommendations, more curious what works for you all in this type of narrative and why? What are topics that have been done really well? Which ones have fallen short and why? What topics would you love to see played out in a story?",0

I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, based on how other people described it. It was simply amazing and an emotional journey. It was really refreshing to have a comedic tone in a science fiction work, but also have so much detail be put into the actual science and engineering. I'm used to lighter or funnier science fiction stories always going full-on ridiculous to eye-rolling amounts.

It was fun, and it was also serious when it needed to be, and was an accurate representation of what often I feel I would do if I were given the same opportunities as Bob, which is probably why I connected so much with the character, as a fellow sci-fi fan and software engineer with anxiety.

1367,"[spoilers] So about Blindsight and Rorschach...One thing I don't get at the end is what came first: rorschach? or the scramblers?

Of all the ""holy shit!"" moments of the book the biggest one for me was this quote:

&gt;*""You misunderstand. Scramblers are the honeycomb. Rorschach is the bees,""*

But then as the story moves on it turns out scramblers are not just cells but incredibly advanced non-sentient intelligent creatures who even wield weapons and the ending hints at them being the ones in control.......but then they don't have genes and are mass assembled by rorschach aka ""SS Jaymie Matthews.""

......and at the same time the scramblers are building rorschach, although this is never clearly stated but there are no other ""platforms"" around besides the skimmers around big ben so I just assume they are the one assembling all those glass spires. IIRC its never clarified where rorschach's ""core"" is, by which I mean whatever drives its massive EM field, regulates its chernobyl-like interior or controls the skimmers and other of its mind-defying tasks.

First time I read the book I just assumed it was one gigantic very alien von neumann/berserker machine (since its never clear if its mission is to destroy other intelligences or just reproduce as a sort of space dandelion) but now it looks more like a space portuguese man o' war combined with the ""chicken and egg"" problem.

So what came first? some kind of probe full of frozen scramblers that began building rorschach out of the debris around big ben once they stumbled upon it? or a very tiny rorschach launched from another planet (or another older rorschach) thousands or millions of years ago?

Are scramblers really an alien lifeform from another planet or just an engineered lifeform created by said aliens to build and maintain the rorschach ""colonies""? I mean unless we figure FTL our interstellar missions might be like this, with earth-scramblers terraforming an exoplanet in some distant star and then hatching humans from vats. This might sound too far fetched but its actually less complicated than FTL.",0

1373,"Look to WindwardI just finished this book.

Banks put into words a lot of what I have been thinking lately about life as entertainment and about the point of living.  Obviously I have not had any conclusive thoughts on these matters.  Does anyone?  Aren't we all, constantly, asking ourselves what the point is of experiencing anything when it is all, ultimately, a form of entertainment?  We may not be effectively immortal as Culture humans are, but for most people living in first world countries, our mortality isn't something we have to seriously consider until we get somewhere around 70 or 80 years old and start encountering our first serious health problems that require active management.  Outside of work, everything we do is meant to keep ourselves occupied until we die.  Even eating is a form of entertainment, not survival.

I will sometimes watch sad movies when I'm already feeling sad because I know my mood will enhance how I experience the story.  It's like my own grief is a form of entertainment to me.

One time, during a particularly rough trip (acid) I was thinking about the fact that this hard experience I was having would at least be character forming, or some kind of accomplishment.  I was persevering over hardship.  Then I realized that I'd bought my tab.  I'd bought this experience.  The unpleasant thoughts and visions I was experiencing were nothing more than a form of entertainment.

Isn't love a form of entertainment?  It is impossible to love someone for who THEY think they are.  The person you love is a fabrication based on your perceptions of the original person.  We love because it makes us feel good.  Any kindness toward that person is ultimately motivated by self interest.

Does anything really matter aside from accumulating pleasurable, or at least interesting, experiences just for the sake of experiencing them?  I think every person asks themself this question constantly and probably never arrives at any answer.

Of course there was more to the book than questions about the meaning of life.  The environments Banks built were truly beautiful and a pleasure to read, more so than in any of his novels I've read so far.  Honestly it was nice to see a story take place ""at home"" and not off on a Contact mission.

I was horribly, deeply moved by the ending, even though I suspected early on &gt;!how things were going to go for Quil.  Didn't expect the Hub, and that was extra sad.!&lt;

1375,"Post-read thoughts on Spiral Wars Book 6This post is going to contain massive spoilers for Rando Splicer. If you've never read the Spiral Wars series, get out of here and go do that. Now. It's like Mass Effect but so much better and more unique than that.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, first things first. PEANUT MVP!

&gt;""What does 'Peanut' mean?"" Rhi'shul asked. ""'Steel Warrior',"" Erik lied.

First time really seeing the new drones in combat and they do not disappoint. The high-tech hold the door scenario with vibroblades and the hacked car surfing were the high points of the Dul'Rho action scenes. I do wish we got to see more of the other two drones, though. Aside from the action, the croma are a very interesting race, and the book builds up to the 'retirement home' reveal very well. It was heartbreaking. In the political sphere, I'm not sure if I trust Sho'mo'ra the same way I trust Gesul, but right now the croma are the only ones that can break the corbi's living nightmare.

Speaking of which, Tiga... This character and all corbi, god damn. It's an impossible situation for her, and I don't blame her for the choices she makes. So much of this book, or even this series, is an exploration of loyalty to species versus loyalty to galaxy versus loyalty to principles, and what happens when those come into conflict with each other. Final thing before we talk about the finale, multicultural Phoenix crew is awesome! I was hoping that Rhi'shul or other croma would join the zoo, but the political situation doesn't fit and the croma are probably too large for the ship's passages. Human, tavalai, kuhsi, and drysine will do for now, although it looks like we might be getting some corbi in Phoenix's marine company, which I am really happy about. But enough of Dul'Rho, over to Rando.

I'm just going to come right out and say it. The final assault on the Splicer was perhaps one of the greatest literary experiences I've ever read. The whole book was great, but the last 10% just ratchets it up to 11/10. It far exceeds the battles of Tartarus, Gamesh, and Defiance in books 2-4 in the variation and weight of emotions it provokes, although Defiance comes close and definitely has its own spot due to the space battle. Rando Splicer is no Mass Effect 2 where everyone lives and we all go home happily ever after. This is an actual suicide mission.

This isn't like the other battles in this series. The deepynines are goddamn scary, but with drysine support, Phoenix can beat them. But the reeh? The reeh have been setup in the last book as invincible, all-seeing, completely in command of the situation at all times with their insane genetic and network technology. Phoenix was nearly annihilated last time they faced off against them, even Styx was outsmarted. Yet for the Splicer assault the only forces available are untrained corbi, two unarmoured human marines, and the element of surprise. Trace is sure she is going to die. Everyone knows the odds are impossible. As the reader, we know that Erik has progressed to the point where the Major's presence is no longer needed to keep Phoenix running smoothly. It's the perfect time to kill off this important character that's been with us since the beginning. I certainly expected it going in.

Yet when Phoenix Company descended from the sky and blew their way into the hangars, I had hope, counterbalanced by the knowledge of just how close Trace is to total annihilation. Trace and Rika's breakout of the reeh encirclement only to find Giddy's corpse, and the following mad rush from Phoenix Company to get to Trace were the most stressful yet epic parts of the entire battle, contrasted beautifully. In the end, Trace is not saved. Her body survived, but her mind is broken beneath the weight of what she did to the corbi and their world. Perhaps for good.

&gt;""Pena?"" Rika murmured sleepily. ""Is Pen okay?""

I think my mind might be broken too after that.

Rest in peace Pena, Tano, Sigo, Bega, Gideon Kono, all of the heroes who stormed the Splicer, and the many millions who will suffer under reeh retaliation. Your sacrifices will never be forgotten. o7",0

1378,"Ninefox Gambit, by Yoon Ha LeeTL;DR: Excellent. Almost a breath of New Weird brought to military SF, and very very welcome.  

I was nervous of this one. I've never been a huge fan of military SF, which tends either to be techwank-thriller or David Drake discipline-fetish stuff. 

But there were a lot of glowing reviews, so fine. 

In a universe where consensus belief can extend the laws of physics in arcane ways, the minutiae of cultural observances (right down to *systems of timekeeping*) in the population can be used as weapons of war - and whoever controls those observances thus controls everything else. 

This sounds like a setup for Warhammer 40k god-emperor, church-of-war kind of thing... but it goes in some really fascinating and unexpected directions instead. With rule divided into separate, semi-rival clans (for reasons of numerology if nothing else), a central unifying authority is absent, leading away from that rather cliched trope. 

What results instead is... strange and rather awesome. 

Sent to re-take a fortress from a group of heretics disrupting the very technology her forces rely on, Kel Cheris enlists the services of an old, disgraced, and very sneaky general to give her an edge. But how far can she trust his motivations? 

That's the basic setup, and it plays out reasonably straightforwardly from there. But oh, the setting and the imagery and the flavour of the book... is unique, intricate and beautiful. 

Since half of warfare in-universe is *semiotic* in nature, the use of icons and banners and symbology and ritual is a crucial part of every consideration - not merely cosmetic, but an integral part of the entire effort. It smacks very slightly of *A Practical Guide to Evil*, though in a much more subtle and integrated way. 

The reader is dumped into the universe without a clue in hell how anything works, and the names of everything from battle formations to the arcane and mostly undescribed weaponry in play leave you utterly confused.. but wanting more. Wanting *so much* more. 

I absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of this series. 

Ten out of ten.",0
1379,"In Viriconium - magic or mess?(This is a slightly edited repost from r/books \- hoping to get some feedback here)

I have become a bit of a fan of M John Harrison in the last year or so. His Kefahuchi Tract trilogy has been blowing my mind. So it seemed logical to pick up *In Viriconium*. I like fantasy too, particularly with the weird SF trails and decaying artifacts that this series of - novellas? novels? contains. But...

I had to put it down for about three months towards the end of the book because I honestly couldn't take it any more. I recently came back to finish it off. I admit there were brilliant bits, and sonehow finally getting to the end did create some sense of completeness, but the more welcome feeling was of closure.

I'm curious to know what other readers thought. I found it such hard work, and so meandering that I often lost track of what was supposed to be going on at any given point in the narrative. In *Light*, for example, I would be so exhausted by the prose that I would have to  stop and rest, which I enjoyed, because generally the story was staying  on track but the style was working on me more like poetry, which requires time to digest.

With *In Viriconium* I felt much less satisfied. I would be left with glimpses and impressions of the critique of the genre he was trying to produce, but often found this mired in a sense of confusion and directionless, or that his critique required not returning to characters and refusing at almost every turn to give me any kind of emotional pay off, that I generally found the experience more confusing and depressing than enlightening.

Parts of the stories still stay with me. A general vision of a bleak, empty future, populated with a surprising number of wily, determined dwarves - for reasons I don't understand. Frustration remains as another less satisfying residue.

1380,"What Ever Happened to Rocket Ships?Now I know that much of sci-fi (or what's called sci-fi, i.e. space fantasy, space westerns, etc.) has 90% of its setting and technology decided by repetitive tropes, cliches, drawings by artists unrelated to any known principle of engineering, and poorly rationalized pseudoscience. So it's no surprise that many ships look like toasters or frisbees and have a form that bears no apparent relationship to their mechanical functioning or the logic of space travel and combat.

So that explains why most science fiction ships make no sense. What I am wondering is why rocket ships have fallen completely out of favor? Rocketships, at least in general design, are the single most realistic spacecraft design ever popularized. This is because they are based on the way in which we do, and likely always will, build our high-performance spacecraft: with rockets. And because, if they need to take off from planets, that rocket needs to point at the ground and the body needs to be aerodynamic. Now a ship not meant to take off or travel through atmospheres does *not* need that distinctive rocket shape, though chances are (for interstellar medium, radiation and other considerations) it would still be a series of tubes or modules with a giant rocket at the end. A spaceplane or aerospace vehicle is a bit different, but it's also basically going to be a rocketship with wings and a more neutral orientation for 'down' than a rocketship has.

Having advanced technology would not make rocketships less practical - it would make them MORE practical. If you have very powerful thrusters and very strong materials you will still find that the rocket design is overall the best design, and it's completely obvious why.

Rocketship designs are so obviously the *correct* way to build *any* self-propelled launcher ship that you basically have to invent superscience to explain why and *how* any surface-to-orbit ship could not be shaped like a rocket. And yet I rarely see rocketships, even in relatively hard science fiction. Why? What's wrong with designing something, you know, *correctly?*

Possibly this is something like beam weapons being so popular when the circumstances (close range, low Gs) visible in most sci-fi would make autocannons and missiles clearly superior in basically every way. It's a thing that science fantasy has taught audiences and hack writers 'should' be in the genre, like elves in fantasy, no matter how little sense it makes in the context.",0
1381,"Blindsight was so very disappointingI finally read Blindsight recently after the overwhelming praise it gets here on printsf - seemingly every recommendation thread will have Blindsight pop up one way or another. So I gave it a shot. 

Unfortunately, I didn't really find it to be all that great, and I certainly am having a hard time understanding the book's seeming status as a modern classic on this sub. it does have some positives. The Scramblers are really creepy and the initial forays into the Rorschach were like something out of a horror movie. Very well done. The premise of consciousness and sentience being a mistake and unnecessary is interesting as well (however implausible and nonsensical).

But nothing else worked. Personally, I value characterization above all else in stories, sci fi or otherwise. I don't even need likable characters - just interesting, compelling ones with depth and complexity. Blindsight just horribly fails in this regard. Not only are the characters are unlikable, they're *boring* as hell. They're basically vehicles for Watts to spring is ideas off of. There's just no human element to connect to, nothing about anyone that's interesting other than the Unique Scientific Condition Watts decides to inflict them with. Neat idea to have a character who can't feel emotion. Unfortunately dull as hell in execution. 

And despite the grounding of the story in hard science and the ability to come up with some cool concepts, Watts really isn't a good storyteller. The pacing is all out of whack, there's no sense of place or atmosphere (other than when the characters are in the alien ship) and sometimes it's just really hard to follow who's doing what and where. All too often though, Watts just lets the science and the jargon get in the way of a good story (although this has always been an issue with genre in general). The prose is...well, it has its moments but it's fairly bland for the most part.

And honestly, the main thesis statement Watts is going for...the whole spiel against consciousness, promising as it was...it just comes across as mostly bullshit and faux-edgy. It honestly sometimes read like the ramblings of a drugged out college student sitting in front of his laptop. Some of the science just didn't make sense and it seems like Watts is trying to pass off some idea that he had as cold hard facts.

So all in all it was a big letdown. Guess I'll have to stick to Alastair Reynolds for my fix of hard sf with cool concepts and terrible characters.",0
1382,"Peter F Hamilton &amp; his enzyme bonded concreteHave read Pandora's star and almost finished Judas unchained.

Here's my thoughts:

- Amazing world building and intricate politics and history

- Some great concepts like the dyson alpha barrier 

- Feels like he gets off a bit on Melanie's character, especially when she's being used by some rich space trillionare. Reminds me of the grammys e.t.c how he always starts with a detailed breakdown of what the female characters are wearing, a bit seedy and lame.
Female characters writing often pretty shallow, especially after reading Ian M Banks and Alastair reynolds who are superb at female chars.

- He really loves telling us about the enzyme bonded concrete doesn't he...

1386,"Which of these first contact novels should I read?I thought I'd try something a little different than the usual sort of recommendation thread.

Background first:  My favorite book of all time is Ender's Game.  I enjoyed the sequel trilogy back when I first read it a long time ago, but then I shifted most of my attention to fantasy after that and only recently have ventured back into science fiction.  I've read all of the available Expanse novels, and absolutely loved (most) of them.  I gave A Fire Upon the Deep a try about a year ago and it just didn't stick with me.  I loved the very beginning of that novel, but it kind of lost me a little after that.  I ended up putting it down and not picking it back up (maybe I can work my way back up to that one).  I just finished Hyperion and while I thought it was pretty great it took me forever to get through.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just that with four kids and a full time job I don't have as much time to read as I'd like (and when I do, I'm exhausted).

I scoured a few recommendation threads and found some books relating to first contact that sounded interesting.  A quick trip to the library after that and I brought home some of these books to decide from.  Feel free to make the case for one of these books and I'll decide over the weekend which one I'll pick up.

The options:

* Salvation - Peter F. Hamilton
* Pushing Ice - Alistair Reynolds
* Eifelheim - Michael Flynn
* Blindsight - Peter Watts
* Foreigner - C.J. Cherryh

Also, if I don't respond right away, see above (four kids &amp; job), I will read every comment eventually.

I'm looking for stories with great and somewhat plausible ideas, added bonus if it's about First Contact or otherwise depict humanity's dealings with interstellar intelligences.

Already read James Corey's ""Expanse"" series and Kim S Robinson's ""Mars"" trilogy, excellent stuff. 
 
Come to think of it, the space setting isn't a hard requirement as long as the ideas are sufficiently mind-boggling. Both Reynolds and Watts have this mind-boggling quality to them, which arguably comes at the cost of solid character writing, but that's not a great concern.

Occasionally authors can get a little too political if the parallels are too obvious with current events or they overly use characters to preach. Even then I’ve never stopped reading a series because of it. 

My main point however is about interacting with authors on social media.

I have read five of Neal Asher’s books and I enjoy them a lot. I started interacting with him some on Twitter and he has a public Facebook page. 

To my great surprise he spends a lot of time talking about climate denial, linking obscure blogs, And deriding the scientific community.  He posted a few other odd conspiracy theory type posts.

I finally got up the nerve to ask him why he didn’t link more peer reviewed scientific articles to bolster his point...I was promptly blocked

I’m still going to read the rest of his books but I must admit I have a bit of an odd feeling while reading his works now but I hope that will go away soon. I was also a little disappointed but he is so passionate about the subject but can’t take a question/challenge.

Has anyone had a similar situation to this? Do you think in general sci-fi and fantasy authors should stay out of public controversies or at least keep it rare?

https://recaptains.co.uk/

EDIT: I managed to find a recap on goodreads, click to reveal.

&gt;!The book starts out with aliens landing on Earth and their form morphs into human form to assimilate into human culture.

&gt;!The story jumps back and forth through time showing humanity at various points, but also following the main characters most of the time. Our characters are brought together as an assessment team to be taken to a new alien ship that they discovered that may have new technology and also somehow has humans on board and it is unknown how they were on the ship. While our characters are enroute to the ship they tell stories of how they know each other that takes us back in time.

&gt;!The first story involves security for Connexion, the company that controls Earth’s portals. Technology created in 2062 using quantum entanglement that lets humans instantly transport via portals across the stars. The character, Callum, falls in love and secretly marries a security officer for the company who is about to go on an undercover mission. During her undercover mission she gets injured in a bomb blast and she is mistaken for one of the terrorists, who are all send to a barren alien world where the company banishes criminals and political opponents. The main character uses his resources to go on a rescue mission where they go to the barren alien planet at the edge of the solar system and rescue his wife, putting him at odds with another character in the story, Yuri, who is head of security for Connexion.

&gt;!Time jumps way forward onto Juloss where human modification is the norm and it seems there is a war between humanity. The characters in the story we have been following are known as “Saints” in the future and we follow a group of humans who are created in the human original image and trained as warriors for battle.

&gt;!The next story follows Yuri, now head of security, in the future who tracks down a missing child. He is tasked with finding out who took the child and getting him back. This leads us through a chase of seedy organized crime and organ snatching and the child is saved at the last minute by Yuri. During the mission one of the operatives is kidnapped.

&gt;!The next flash back takes us to Alik, an FBI agent investigating a mass murder in which two rival gangs kill multiple people in a portal home. It turns out a high end assassin, named Cancer, is also involved and the Gang family members remaining are arrested and sent through a portal to their doom as punishment.


&gt;!Kandara is hired by a Utopian society to find out who is hacking their systems. She discovers hidden signs of sabotage of their industrial plans and believes Cancer is killed during an explosion. It is unknown why someone would sabotage the industrial systems.

&gt;!The story jumps back to the Future where the trainers are older and are still training for their war.

&gt;!Back to the assessment team who finally make it to the alien ship. The ship has an organic brain inside and think the ship was riding a worm hole tunnel and somehow got thrown off course and crash landed. No crew is located but multiple chambers with humans are found in them. All but for one are limbless and have k cell organs giving support to a limbless body. The one intact human is shockingly someone they know from Earth, the Connexion security member that got abducted during Yuri's story. They have him taken out of stasis waiting for him to wake while the crew debates over what this all means and the connection to Cancer and piece together that all of their stories involve Cancer stealing or weakening Earth defenses.

&gt;!Flash back to Feriton Kayne who tells the story how he was sent to spy on the Olyix alien ship by posing as a religious figure sent to visit the ship. He smuggles aboard tiny flying sensors that he sneaks via tunnels to a restricted area of the ship that they believe is hiding part of the alien's secret plans.

&gt;!Flash back forward to the assessment team where he tells them the restricted area on the ship contained ancient pyramid structures probably of religious value from their home world, and not portals to their home world as they suspected. As they are talking Jessika swings an axe, killing Feriton.

&gt;!Flash forward to the future where our human warriors are now on their ship leaving Juloss for war. The captain says a prayer as their ship crosses through a portal and they pray for their Saints: Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik, and Jessika. They finally reveal that they are preparing for war with the Olyix and are setting out to hunt them down.

&gt;!The assessment team looks in amazement as Jessika just cut Feriton's head open with an axe. She reveals that she is an alien known as Neána and she has been posing as a human looking to infiltrate the Olyix. She reveals that the hidden area in the Olyix ship does not contain temples, but a worm hole link to the Olyix home world where they will send an invasion force that will forcefully assimilate humans to join their religious journey to the end of the Galaxy. The team sees that Feriton's brain has been replaced with a Olyix brain and that the Olyix now know about all their activities and will be preparing to invade. She also reveals that the intact human body they found on the Olyix ship was one of her partners who got himself abducted and forced the ship to crash out of the wormhole tunnel. Yuri pulls out a hidden portal he has as they prepare to notify Earth defenses.

The most popular is to blame torch drives and so forth on aliens, but IRL aliens live in the same universe as us so there's no reason a torch drive shouldn't vaporize them instantly just like it would us. What I am interested in is a future /space setting that doesn't invoke handwavium for anything, and which bases all technology they have on things that are plausible under our best science and preferably already in prototype. Which basically means very slow spaceships and Earth probably still being by far the most developed place in Sol (unless they've gone hard into space habitats; I think anyone who could teraform Mars wouldn't bother because they're already masters of space engineering).

Basically what GURPS would call TL9 conservative hard science fiction. I know there's reason to believe unexpected tech will be in our future, but the hand wave tech in SciFi tropes are almost certainly not the ones we'll encounter.

Basically: no torch drives, FTL, godlike AI, gravity control, or impossibly versatile nanomachines off the top of my head ; also any advanced tech should be logically applied to the setting : no miners begging for water rations when fusion and rocks can make it cheap and easily recyclable.",0
1425,"A possibly very late opinion on Peter F. Hamilton's ""Salvation Lost""Well, that was... perplexing. We have the trademark Hamilton-esque multitude of characters, but none of them stands out in the way of, say, a Gore Burnelli or Paula Myo (as clichèd as they were); we have the Young Lovers, the Strong Female Warrior, the Rich Guy, the Smart but Misguided kid, the Tough Policeman, blah blah: you could replace a few names with their equivalent from the Commonwealth and it'd be barely noticeable. But Hamilton isn't Banks, and he's never really been about the depths of the human (or sentient being of choice) soul, so that can be easily forgiven.

I felt distinctly less forgiving after the 230th utterance of ""Mother Mary!"" from a certain character; because yeah, OK, it's fun to come up with this stuff and I bet he's got a whole backstory for it, but seriously - who talks like that? ""Mother Mary, it's an alien! Mother Mary, we're all going to die! Mother Mary, coffee on my keyboard,"" come on. But it's a minor point, sure, and I'm just a nitpicker. So let's skip this one too.

Possession. It feels like most Hamilton novels have a variation on the theme. Oh hi, it's my best friend/lover/sibling! Except it isn't, hah. Right, nothing wrong with it in general, but after the Night Dawn's and the Commonwealth it's getting a tad predictable: you can basically point at characters and say ""there's the Starflyer agent"". And then there's... pretty much everything else, really, because it all sounded so familiar at some point I thought I was reading an alternative version of Pandora's Star - but a rather less interesting one. 

Sure: it's Hamilton, so it's entertaining, and there are a few nice ideas and twists here and there. But overall, and unlike with the Commonwealth Saga, I'm not going to count the days until the next book comes out.",0

I recently played the game Control (f'ing loved it) which made me rewatch Beyond the Black Rainbow (which i also love). What I'm looking for specifically is pretty much along the lines of some shady organization attempting to explore a newly discovered dimension , ideally using drugs , psychic powers and technology.  When i think about it there are things like Stranger Things which is kind of the right idea if it were a book, i will admit that I don't love that show (it's ok). In looking around I see a lot that covers all of the things I'm looking for except the dimensional research aspect. I feel like it should be set in the 60s/70s/maybe the 80s because there was still some belief that consciousness expansion might allow access to somewhere else. Searching on anything even remotely esp, dimensional, astral and drugs hits on a lot of things that aren't what I'm going for. I know King has hit on elements of this, but nothing I've looked into seems to hit the dimensional research part while also hitting the rest.  Anyway, if anyone has any assistance, I'd appreciate it.",0
1431,"“4X” Space OperaIn video games, there’s a subset of strategy games called 4x games, which stands for explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.  Many of these are space based and involve playing a race of aliens (or humans) starting with your home planet and exploring space, starting colonies, running into other species, researching technology, and either fighting them or allying with them in hopes of becoming the dominant race in the galaxy.

I’m looking for something in book (likely series) form that tells this kind of story, basically the story of a space faring race over a long period of time.  Progression is key here though, I like the idea of a clear progression in technology and power.  The only thing that comes close to this that I know of is the Bobiverse series, which I was hope the author decides to go back to at some point.",0

So far my impression of Paul is that he's barely a character at all, and more like his sole purpose is to be the perspective of the reader being introduced to the universe. The book so far seems like the epitome of telling instead of showing.

Does it get any better?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys. It's interesting to see so many perspectives on this. I think maybe what's going on is I felt like there was a lot of hype around it because of how often it's suggested, but on some more thought, I think this makes sense. It's a very popular book, but people probably only randomly bring it up if they liked it, and not as often if they didn't.

1434,"The length of some SciFi book series is out of control and ruins them.Don't get me wrong, on the face of it, it's nice to have plenty to read, but I've recently finished Off Armageddon Reef by David Weber, and I gotta say it's a good book, but then I hear there's *at least* 10 books in the whole series.

*Seriously?*

I mean granted it could be one of the greatest epics ever told, but I suspect it'll start to drag and get samey and boring and generally lose focus like Harry Turtledove's World War series, etc. Because of that I didn't even think to bother with the series after the conclusion of WW2 in it. 

Realistically I think the Safehold series could be wrapped up in 3~4 books and leave everyone feeling contented.

Jack McDevitt is fine because his books seem to be reasonable as stand-alone titles in their own right despite being in their own series.

I've already got most of the Expanse series to try and get through (and realizing while not bad books, I'm keener on the TV series and thus feel no rush to read them), just sitting there with a ton of other books waiting to be read that likely wont be at this rate. 

Peter F. Hamilton is a prolific writer but at least he sticks to the Rule of 3. 

I can't remember the last time I read a SciFi book that is a straight-up stand-alone title TBH, but yeah, it really kills the buzz to read the first book in a series, have it paint a pretty little science fiction picture, make you want to find out how it all comes together and concludes, and then realise you're going to have to read a shit ton of other books if you ever want to see the story to the proper end.

1435,"Short SyFi story similar to Carl Sagan's ContactHello all,

I am new to the community, but a question has bugged me for years after I read the book, and especially after I have watched the movie many times. 

My uncle had many, many, volumes of short SyFi stories, especially the ""Years Best Science Fiction"" and I spent many hours reading them as a young teenager. 

To my question. I distinctly remember a short story in where the Earth receives an extrasolar signal that is decoded into instructions for a vehicle. It is built and a similar occurence happens. 

The differance is that it was similar to a rocket sled. The engines ignite and, according to the outside observers, only run for moments before shutting down. However, the vehicle never moves. The occupant experiences a first contact over a significantly longer time, but is discredited.

I still have access to all of my, now deceased, uncle's library but have never been able to find this story. It has bugged me for some time. I don't think I am confusing it with the book Contact though. I distinctly remember a differant design of vehicle. 

Does anyone know which short story this could be? Maybe an earlier version by Carl Sagan under a pseudonym to gauge interest?",0

Rothfuss has A LOT of really delightfully worded sentences that imo it's impressive talent. So that beguiled me and I blew the full price on it. Unfortunately, I hate the plot, it centres around a main character who imo comes across as a teenager ""Me, me, me"" who's also so amazing at everything atst as talking with others as if they're all reading lines from a script and fit words to each other, finishing each other's sentences sort of thing! UGH! I can't stand it.

1440,"SF/ Fantasy of none UK/ US Origin or focusing on none UK/ US culturesFollowing the post earlier today about the Noon Universe books I'm wondering what other none UK/ US based SF/ Fantasy books people would recommend? I mostly read UK/ Us based stuff but don't want to restrict myself (other than reading in English as my understanding of other languages is poor)

I read Poppy War by RF Kuang last year which I loved.

The Metro series is well recommended, I listened to the first one as an audiobook and found the feel of the book to incredibly opressive (intentionally I presume) but not really for me.

I read the Three Body Problem earlier this year and mostly enjoyed it but the concept of the Sophons seemed like a flagrant disregard of known physics (yes, FTL does this as well but usually makes use of some ""undiscovered"" physics to handwave it away rather than).  


I generally most enjoy time travel (The Time Machine, The Company of the Dead, Chronicles of St Mary's), Space Operas (Rendezvous with Rama, Children of Time,  Honour Harrington (we all have guilty pleasures!), Night's Dawn, The Interdependency series), adventures (Wizard of Earthsea, Abhorsen Trilogy, Across the Nightingale Floor, The Magician (the Empire books by Raymond E Feist on my list of stuff to read as I was fascinated by the Tsurani society)).

1443,"I'm beginning to suspect that Adrian Tchaikovsky may be the most underappreciated writer of our time.

**The guy published four distinct works this year, for a total of 1432 pages**, plus a short story in an anthology. Similar number in 2018. And these aren't junk pulp fiction books, but genuinely some of the best speculative fiction of our time.

Is the man a real human? An army of a billion monkeys hitting away on typewriters? A pseudonym for a group of genius scientist authors? 


And sure, people around these parts like Children of Time (which I loved), and some occasionally mention Children of Ruin (which I found pretty good, but less so than CoT) and Dogs of War (which I found lacking - it's basically a long elaboration on one idea), yet, to me, those fan favorites are all in the Asimov-realm of SciFi: Great ideas, but not particularly beautiful prose, nor deep characters.

A few days ago I've seen Cage of Souls [recommended on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dp685w/your_thoughts_on_cage_of_souls_by_adrian/), and man, am I grateful for that. Such magnificent world building, paired with a prose and wit that I didn't associate with Tchaikovsky thus far. 

So. This post, in fact, just serves as an elaborate scheme to get more Tchaikovsky recommendations, what with his extensive bibliography. What book of his shall I read next?

[Guns of the Dawn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23524779-guns-of-the-dawn) seems well-received, but I'm not sure if it's too much military fiction - is it?

[Echoes of the Fall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26863058-the-tiger-and-the-wolf) doesn't tempt me too much with its shape-shifting pitch, though I'm quite open to be convinced otherwise.

1456,"Specific Post-Apocalyptic Fiction Recommendation?I've just started writing a warhammer fantasy roleplay campaign that will take place in a post-apocalyptic world.

Part of the gestation period for any campaign of mine has always been consuming media related to the themes or overall 'feel' the campaign will try to emulate. Towards this end, hit me with books that take place in a post-apocalyptic setting.

Now, both because it interests me and so that this post can differentiate itself from the (likely) dozens of other similar post-apocalyptic recommendation posts, I have a few themes/things I'm on the look out for. I'm primarily looking for any books that discuss or have interesting ideas on:


1) the kind of social institutions/structures that result from resource scarcity. In a post-apocalyptic setting: What would a town look like? Or a group of mercenary salvagers? Or a monarchy? Or import/export company? any interesting take on the kinds of social groups that would form as a result of societal collapse.

2) Interesting causes for an apocalyptic scenario.

3) Technology that existed in a society just prior to its end, what kind of technology would that be? How would it affect people in a resource scarce environment?

4) how does an economy work in a resource scarce environment?

5) Religion? what kind of zealotry does an apocalypse inspire?


If something is an interesting take on the genre, or it discusses something interesting that I'm not considering, or even if it just meant a lot to you feel free to post it here.

The idea was super interesting, and it could be interesting to see developed in a different way. If you haven't read it, the basic idea is a about a guy that wakes up 300 years in the future, after a big economic collapse and in a society where everybody is incorporated, and you can (and are expected) to buy and sell shares of yourself and others. The protagonist hates this because it takes his ""freedom"", and the whole book becomes a struggle between this personal freedom and the public good... As an idea is not bad, and I would love to see a book that explores the student debt becoming something like an investment on the future earns of the individual... but this book is not about that. This books becomes a struggle between a republican ideal of the capitalism and a egoistic libertarianism... Every side giving long speeches why their side is the good one and the other is the bad one, and impossibility of any other idea...

Even that wouldn't be that terrible but the book reads as written in the 60's, not only in the style of scifi, but also in the sexist and classicists  ways that we want to forget, all woman are beautiful with gorgeous bodies and enjoy being ogled, that don't interrupt the male when they talk, and even if they are super smart they will make all their decisions by love... Men in the other hand are genius, well dressed, love tobacco and good whisky and walk decisively. Technology also feels old, AI tend to copy humans, Virtual Reality is bad, flying planes are good, and builidings are tall and cover in crystal. The books loos so old that that I had to check the date of the book when somebody talked about smartphones.

The best definition of this book I found is a coffee conversion between Heinlein and  Ayn Rand but worse written, with flat characters and a wasted idea.

1467,"Looking for recommendations - Hardish sci-fi, first contactI'm looking for some recommendations for books that are harder on the scale of science fiction hardness. Not necessarily super hard, but more along the lines of The Expanse or Revelation Space rather than Star Trek, if that helps. Looking for recommendations from the last +-20 years too. 

Ideally, I'm looking for novels or series with exo-planet colonization, first contact, AI, cloning, or military sci-fi. Preferably no artificial gravity, FTL or star fighters please. Individual books or series can cover one or more of the above subjects please. I'm really picky about writing style as well, so I'll give some examples of books that I did and didn't like below:

**Liked:**

\- The Expanse (James S.A. Corey) - Love these guys and the story overall, even if I don't like some of the books as much as others. By far my favourite writers in terms of style. 

\- Revelation Space and Revenger (Alastair Reynolds) - the writing and pacing can be uneven but I'll basically read whatever he writes because to a layperson like me it reads like it's plausible.

\- Frontlines (Marko Kloos) - don't like the artificial gravity but I appreciate his military focus and experience. There's not much worse than reading mil-sci-fi from someone that doesn't know squat about the military. Big plus that the writing is also decent.

\- Old Man's War and Collapsing Empire (John Scalzi) - lots of handwaving but I really like his writing style. 

\- The Martian and Artemis (Andy Weir) - liked the relatively hard sci-fi and writing style. The characters were likable too.

\- Something Coming Through (Paul McAuley) - liked his style and the apparent hardness of the sci-fi.

\- Confederation (Tanya Huff) - Liked the writing style. The story was a bit too pulpy and not at all hard sci-fi, but I think I read six books in the series, so something resonated with me. 

**Disliked/Neutral:**

\- The Commonwealth Saga and Night's Dawn (Peter F. Hamilton). Liked the premise in The Commonwealth Saga but PFH's writing style, particularly the pacing, just kills me. Not sure why I tried Night's Dawn, but I regretted it.

\- Anything by Mike Resnick. Probably my least favourite writer.

\- Anything by John Ringo. Probably my second least favourite writer. 

\- Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Becky Chambers) - just couldn't stand the writing style. The sci-fi was soft but I did like the premise generally.

\- Coyote (Allen Steele, I think) - Liked the premise, bored to tears by the execution.

\- Dread Empire's Fall (Walter Jon Williams) - felt like it was just OK, the space bits were good but the planetside stuff was not appealing to me.

\- The Company Wars (C.J. Cherryh) - I've tried this one a few times and keep giving up after a little while. 

\- Imperial Radch (Ann Leckie) - Tried it and DNF'd after about 30%. Writing style wasn't for me.",0
1468,"Thoughts on GnomonI read Gnomon in October. I was really excited about it because the reviews were just the right kind of mixed. The complaints actually came off as selling points. Super dense, super conceptual, a bit of a sleeper in the sf community. Definitely not one of the over-hyped books that win a Hugo/Nebula and be forgotten in five years.

I loved it as I was reading it. It's disorienting, dense, misleading, stimulating. You feel overloaded with significant information; symbols, clues, and meaning swirl through your head, competing for attention.

The major criticisms are not too bothersome to me. It's probably 100 pages too long. He could cut pages by removing some unnecessary philosophical digressions, make it a little tighter in general. The page count could go back up a little bit if he spent more time on some real-world action (and outside the embedded narratives).

But now I feel my criticisms growing.&gt;! I really do think the book would have been better if we spent more time in the real world. I want to see Annie and Colson fight a bit more, I want to see a little more of how technology is impacting their world. I want to know how all of these narratives relate to the real life of Annie, and I've grappled with enough books like this to know that the answers just aren't there. !&lt;

&gt;!I feel Mielikki is torn away from us a little prematurely at the end. I get that she served her purpose, but removing the main perspective character abruptly at the end hurt the resolution I think.!&lt;

Furthermore, while the book is billed as a contemporary 1984, I think the central thesis of the book is undercut by some of the plotting. In the beginning, the world Mielikki lives in is only a dystopia through our eyes. We sense that there's something perverse about this world of decentralized hyperdemocracy and perfect surveillance, but everyone who actually lives in it seems to think it's kinda chill. &gt;!The downfall of that society is a secret corruption in the System wherein Firespine works to persuade the public what to believe. BUT, that's not what's fucked up about a surveillance state run by an AI. That's a fictional flaw in this one specific world, and it doesn't sufficiently articulate the \*many\* things that would be harmful about such a place.!&lt;

I still really enjoyed the book and will definitely continue to recommend it to people, but the present-tense glow and excitement are starting to wear off.",0
1469,"If I read Startide Rising and A Fire Upon the Deep, should I immediately follow them up with Uplift War/Deepness in the Sky?I have not read any novels by David Brin or Vernor Vinge. I know they are acclaimed and popular SF authors who have won a number of Hugo awards, and I want to check them out.

I planned on reading Brin's Startide Rising and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep over winter break. However, both of these books have sequels which also won the Hugo Award for Best Novel. I am wondering how I should approach these authors. 

Are these the kind of books where you need to read the sequel immediately after the first one? Or could I take a break between them?

Would it be better to just read Startide then Uplift, and then read A Fire Upon the Deep and then Deepness in the Sky? Stick to one of these authors and go all the way, so to speak, as opposed to alternating between them? I had planned on checking out each of their novels, but if it is better to check out Startide/Uplift together instead, I could do that. 

Thanks for the help, I appreciate it!",0
1470,"Month of October Wrap-Up!Sorry for the delay folks, got distracted on the first and just plum forgot to get back to it yesterday.  What did you read last month, and do you have any thoughts about them you'd like to share?

Whether you talk about books you finished, books you started, long term projects, or all three, is up to you. So for the slower readers or those who have just been too busy to find the time, it's perfectly fine to talk about something you're still reading even if you're not finished.

1471,"Thoughts on Blue MarsThis one wasn't quite as engaging, although I still enjoyed it. I think a big part of it is that in Red Mars especially we were right there with the First Hundred as they changed the world around them but in Blue Mars the change largely happens outside the story and we only see its outcomes. The entire series is about the growth of Martian civilisation, so without that the plot becomes rather thin. 

This book was heavily character focused instead and a key theme was characters not being able to recapture their past, including Michel with Provence, Nadia with the first days on Mars, and Ann with pre-colonial Mars. It seemed very fitting theme given the age of the characters and the amount of change on Earth and Mars during their lives. Of course it was all build-up for the memory treatment, which I honestly didn't love, but it was nice to see the characters find a bit more satisfaction in their lives. 

I really loved the constitutional congress at the start. Not just because Nadia and Art are amazing, but because I loved the process of designing an ideal society. Of course it turned out less than utopian (I was worried he might have abandoned realism) but still a great achievement. It was a little depressing how readily the rest of the solar system adopted tribalism as the expansion continued. 

I again really enjoyed Maya’s PoV and Part 12 was one of my favorites. I don't know why but something about her brings out the poeticism of KSR’s writing like no other character does. 
&gt;“Inside her ticked a bomb. In the old days it had had 3 billion ticks, more or less. Now they had rigged it to have 10 billion - or more - or less. The ticks kept ticking nevertheless.” 

&gt;“She stopped, stilled by something in the double vision, by a realisation - or the edge of an epiphany - and felt some vast truth pushing at her, just outside her - or inside her body, even, inside her skull but outside her thoughts, pushing at the dura that encased the brain - everything explained, everything come clear at last, for once.” 

Passages like these (from consecutive pages) really appeal to me, as do the descriptions of Mars which seem more vivid through Maya's perspective. 

I lost a bit of interest in the final sections with Sax and Ann, particularly when their boat turned into Dorothy's house from The Wizard of Oz (seriously what was that about?) but the epilogue (if not in name) with the remnants of the First Hundred taking the newest generation to the beach was delightful. The writing was beautiful as ever and it was a really good way to symbolise Ann’s acceptance of life on Mars and the end of the First Hundred’s story.

I know this is incredibly immature of me but I can't read the line “Uranus fat in the middle of it, the sun a blazing jewel just to one side,” and not laugh. I just can't. I guess I'll always be a child. And on that note...",0
1472,"Just finished Blindsight and have a few questions about the logic (spoilers)Jumping right in I think I can condense to a few central points

1- After chancing upon human communications the crawlers 'consume resources' in their decoding 'for no meaningful translation... for zero payoff and reduced fitness. The signal a virus.' (273) I like this concept and agree that most human communication has no relevance to a being without our shared cultural context but that is only the start. First language analysis and later contact is effort but has the end goal of developing an understanding to hone in on the beneficial information (whether by eavesdropping or contact and cooperative development of a shared lexicon). Instead of cutting their losses or accepting most of the data is useless they instead devote even more resource announce themselves with the fireflys? 

2-What is the nature of Rorschach and it's relation to the crawlers? Rorschach is presented as a living (or at least continuously evolving) thing 'even when the walls didn't move they did.' (130) Did I miss the physical explanation of how rock moves itself? Is Rorschach itself orchestrating it's own movement? Whether crawler is chicken and Rorschach is egg or vice versa, what is the purpose of the crawler? How does this purpose require its intense sensory and intellectual ability?

3- What is the motivation of the alien species both in their interactions with humans and on a philosophical level? 

I listened to this book on audiobook sometimes while working which, in retrospect, was not ideal for this title in particular so sorry if i miss something obvious in these questions. I pulled up the ebook to make some citations I'll link it and happily reread any pertinent sections.",0

In the end apocalypse comes and takes the cities away while the philosophers rise from the ashes to restart society. 

That's a lot of scope for 150 pages. I would say it is still relevant today as books transmit values and knowledge though they require much more effort than just browsing your smart phone and consuming social media.

Harrowing, fatalist, but somehow uplifting in the end.

I can't really find any obvious pre-1972 novels that are what he is talking about.

What all those stories have in common is that they describe ""ordinary scientific work"" with some kind of minor twist that make them SF (for example the alien virus in Andromeda Strain, the Mars colonization in The Martian or the destruction of a satellite in Gravity). So, they are not about extremely advanced tech like time travelling, hyperspace exploration, force fields or teleportation, but instead very close to reality, underpinned by scientific facts.

1506,"Looking to identify some SF short stories from my early teen years.I used to read a lot of random science fiction from my dad's collection some 15-20 years ago, and a lot of them really stuck to my head. It's been ages since then though and my memories are pretty blurry, and I could be mixing them up with each other, so apologies in advance if the explanations suck. But there's:

**Firstly**, A short story where some kind of aliens had invaded and colonised Earth and forced humanity to live on the moon as exiles. It's about a pair of friends who go see an old person in some remote area, who talks about good old times and some history.

I remember the story focusing on themes of gender quite a bit: apparently changing one's gender was quite common in this society, and the pair of friends had done it quite a few times too (it might've been that the other friend was currently a girl and they were having a sexual relationship). The old man seemed to look down on such shenanigans.

**Secondly**, A short story *collection* about a somewhat morally ambiguous inventor/scientist in an extremely advanced space-faring society. I remember it being quite satirical / tongue in cheek in tone, and from the collection, I remember two stories in particular: 

One in which the inventor's friend creates some kind of a microplanet with its own people, culture and civilisation, and then proceeds to rule over as essentially a god. The protagonist inventor disapproves: at the end of the story, it's discovered the society has advanced massively in technology, and they've rebelled and killed the friend.

And two, where the inventor is hired to ""assassinate"" the king/ruler of some world by putting him into a virtual reality machine so pleasant he won't want to wake up. He goes through several iterations that all fail due to the king's stubbornness, until finally he makes a simulation that's essentially an infinite nested Matryoshka dolls, a kind of an endlessly layered dream-within-a-dream that he can never wake out of.

**Thirdly**, and by far most vaguely, I seem to recall a short story with more or less the exact plot of that humorous [The Onion interview](https://i.imgur.com/Mpfdcm1.png). A kind of a bizarre horror story about overlapping realities, set on a spaceship, with duplicates (parallel versions?) of crew members appearing.

1511,"Good ""Presentation and discussion"" SF stories?This is a genre that I haven't seen much discussion of which is weird because it seems like it has quite a few examples. Stories which don't have much of a plot in the traditional sense but are about one character inviting several others into their home and presenting a curiosity to them, which is followed by the characters discussing the implications of this, some being sceptical of the claims at all and some having life changing crisis of faith as a result.

An old example is the framing story of *The Time Machine* where of course the nameless time traveller is explaining his invention and adventure to several friends.

Stanislaw Lem was very fond of these stories, with quite a few of the later Ijon Tichy novellas falling into that cathegory. *Golem XIV* is of course an extreme version of the same.

A cinema only version that I also absolutely love was *The Man from Earth* which executed this trope to perfection in my mind.

It seems to have fallen out of favor though, the closest more recent example that comes to my mind would be *The Merchant and the Alchemists Gate* by Ted Chiang, with maybe *Liking What You See* going in a similar direction though of course a vastly different narrative structure.

1514,"I need help tracking down a (short?) storyA talk on the topic of SF jarred my brain, and I'm now trying to remember the name of a story I read what feels like years ago. I'm pretty sure it was a part of an anthology.

What I recall of the plot was that there was a wormhole or some other similar way to either travel about or go ""somewhere else,"" but everyone who went (and came back) were either insane or self-terminated. One previous pilot was noted for having used the on-board auto-doc to commit suicide by vivisection. All attempts at electronic mapping of the end point failed.

That's all I have sadly. And I fear I may be mixing up two stories. Does the above disjointed ramble ring any bells? I've tried googling for stories using wormholes, various words for auto-docs, and even suicide by vivisection, but nothing comes up. Help me reddit, you're my only hope.

On this, we would agree that the following regular publishing authors are the best/well known in the Hard SF sphere at the moment: 

Greg Egan, Stephen Baxter and Kin Stanley Robinson.  And in some spot we can also add a few others like Peter Watts, Alastair Reynolds, etc. Being the first 3 the ones who really focus intentionally in the harder side of the science fiction. 

The thing is, those guys are only three of the hundreds of writers publishing nowadays and they're getting old and I don't see any young writers running up in the Harder Sci Fi spectrum. And probably that's why we are getting less often Hardish Sci Fi and much more Sci Fi with a few Hard bits?, or it's been like this all the time, don't know. So here are my questions:

A few changes - before I pick a book, I do a sneaky peek on its reviews on [goodreads.com](https://goodreads.com). Its helped weed out some of the curly ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

**An absolute pleasure to read:**

**Dogs of War ( Tchaikovsky ).** This book is great fun. Good action and the story is from the perspective of a dog, done quite well!

**Salvation (Hamilton).** His books are typically epic space operas with incredible action and world building, but with lots of fluff and useless characters in between. Hamilton has really hit his mark here. The fluff is cut down,  the story is more concise and retains the qualities of his other works. I loved the setting on Zagreus, very chilling.

**Nexus/ Crux/ Apex ( Ramez ).** The common theme with these top books are that they jump straight into the story from page 1, no exception here. Very detailed series on mind alteration technologies. Books 2 and 3 did drag on some but still enjoyable.

**Blue Remembered Earth / On the Steel Breeze ( Reynolds ).** Cool concepts in this hard scifi book. I really appreciate a book where the protagonists are every-day Gregs and save themselves with wits rather than the usual combat.

**Time and time again (  Elton ).** An easy fun read. Might not be quite up with the previous entries but the historical setting was a refreshing change.

 **Redemption  (Baxter).** Final (?) book of his outstanding Xeelee series. Just go and read them.

**In the mouth of the whale (McAuley).** This is part of his Quiet War series, and could be a standalone. The battle around the gas giant is the most authentic and riveting space battle I can think of in any scifi book. This series and the Xeelee books are my favourite 2 scifi series.

**Skyward  (Branderson).** Technically its a young adult book, but nonetheless a real page turner.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Good**

**Empire Games/Dark State (Charles Stross)**. Well written story and unique ideas, I just find the whole concept of 'parallel dimensions' pretty lame and more of a fantasy trope.

 **Ancestral night  ( Bear ).** This book had nice far-future ideas but it written from the perspective of an edgy youngster which is slightly grating. Misses the slick prose of the books above.

&amp;#x200B;

**Terrible**

**Last ones left alive ( Davis-Goff).** Ugh. Zombies in Ireland, written like a highschool student. Boring and dumb, couldn't finish it.",0

1527,"Tracking down a book dealing with machine intelligence and nanobotsBook was published in the early 2000s (I believe). It concerned a computer that became sentient, and a near future setting that I think was Great Britain. 

Part of the story included the computer *itself* thinking on a grand scale about other machine intelligences that could have developed in the universe. It became concerned that any one of these other possible machine intelligences could became nihilistic or adversarial to the existence of the universe as we know it.

If such a machine intelligence developed this nihilistic outlook, then it could create self-replicating subatomic nanobots that destroy organized matter itself.

It eventually thought a way through to protect against this, and manipulated the various main characters to execute its plan.

1528,"Controversy Surrounding Liu CixinI've seen some comments regarding Cixin's works, and I guess I've taken it upon myself to make sure people stay informed. I wanted to comment to this effect in another thread, but for the life of me I can't find it. So here's a previous post I made regarding Cixin and his ideals:

I'd be wary of Cixin. He's a CCP stooge and supports their camps.

Edit: A direct quote from the New Yorker: 

When I brought up the mass internment of Muslim Uighurs—around a million are now in reëducation camps in the northwestern province of Xinjiang—he trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: “Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty.”

And here is another: 

""If China were to transform into a democracy, it would be hell on earth,” he said. “I would evacuate tomorrow, to the United States or Europe or—I don’t know.” The irony that the countries he was proposing were democracies seemed to escape his notice. He went on, “Here’s the truth: if you were to become the President of China tomorrow, you would find that you had no other choice than to do exactly as he has done.” 

And yet another: 

His views turned out to be staunch and unequivocal. The infamous one-child policy, he said, had been vital: “Or else how could the country have combatted its exploding population growth?” He was deaf to the argument that the population growth was itself the result of a previous policy, from the fifties, in which the Party had declared that “a larger population means greater manpower.” Liu took a similarly pragmatic view of a controversial funeral-reform law, which mandates cremation, even though the tradition of “returning to the ground” has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. (There were reports of elderly people committing suicide in order to be buried before the ban went into effect.) “If there are dead bodies everywhere, where are we supposed to plant crops?” Liu said. “Humans must adjust their habits to accommodate changing circumstances.”",0

1530,"What are some good books with AI focus that are *actually about the AI*?Pre-warning, I'm getting really frustrated and might insult your favorite book. I'll mark spoilers

I'm really struggling here, I want some good books about like Von Neumann probes, Gestalt Artificial Intelligence, Robots etc. But like every single one, EVERY SINGLE FREAKING ONE I find is 98.9% about  humans instead. I don't care about humans, humans are boring as crap and I can't stand them in basically any novel. I read Sci-fi for aliens and AI. I read fantasy for elves and magical races. I don't read anything for the humans. 

All the AI focused novels I can find  are all just ""Blah blah pSycHoLoGY"", ""blah blah cUlTuRE"", ""blah blah mOrAliSm"" ""blah blah wHaT mAkEs uS hUmAN???//?/""

[I DON'T CARE ABOUT HUMANS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy), go extinct for all I care, freaking boring! Give me death robots or AI that are spreading through out the universe dealing with alien life or something. 

The Bobiverse books were fun when Bob was focused on exploring and being a pseudo AI. Then the entire series basically died when (warning, spoilers for all the Bobiverse books) &gt;!he decided to go back to Earth and save the humans for no apparent reason and it turned into typical political bull crap with Bob bending over backwards to deal with beyond stupid humans and their absurd demands. All the ""aliens"" were literally just ""humans with fur and green skin"" type ""aliens"" too, where they act exactly like humans and look 98% like them too. They were still fun books, but the fun drastically went away when it turned into politics and 80% of the plot revolved around humans again !&lt;


Murderbot books had potential when I read the synopsis, but it turned out &gt;!it was just a cyborg with borderline autistic levels of social anxiety and was just yet another book focused on freaking humans and how a robot interacts with human nature. I DON'T CARE ABOUT HUMAN NATURE IN MY ROBOT BOOK, GTFO !&lt;

Expeditionary Force has an AI, and the books had potential at first, [but were just too meh for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/91uor8/does_expeditionary_force_get_any_better_spoilers/)

Don't even get me started on Blindsight. Are we humans, or are we dancing Vampires with cyborg implants. Cyborgs were the worst thing to happen to Sci-fi -_-

I'm about to drop Ancillary Justice, I'm several hours in, and it's literally ""AI monologues with humans about human morals and human psychology, the book"". Please, someone tell me this series gets better and focuses on the, y'know, multi thousand year old artificial intelligence instead of random political trash


Stuff like Children of Ruin / Time are great, but not because of the AI angle as the ""AI"" is just a human, but the books are good. Not exactly what I'm looking for though, same with things like House of Suns where there is a tiny bit of AI but it's like, barely a background detail. I'd love a House of Suns series focused on the robots instead though, for sure!

1550,"Slan (A.E. van Vogt)I recently read the book [Neurotribes](https://www.stevesilberman.com/books/), on the history of autism, which recounts the effect *Slan* had on some readers at the time (1940), and how one in particular was inspired to reach out to other SF fans: 

&gt; The book had an electrifying effect on (Claude) Degler, and suddenly his true destiny became clear. He and his fellow fen were “star-begotten” mutants trapped behind enemy lines. Science fiction fandom was no mere diversion for daydreaming teenagers and egghead professors; it was the first stirrings of a geek uprising against the mundanes who had oppressed them for so long. He came up with a rallying cry that spread through fandom like a viral meme: “Fans are Slans!” 

So I decided I should read it and see what all the fuss was about. By modern standards it's clunky and all over the place. One thing that impressed me was how much van Vogt was able to say about the possibilities of nuclear power, given how little on the topic was known publicly in 1940. I thought the story got away from the author a bit during the 3rd act, but came together nicely by the end. 

Other reviews have mentioned how influential this book was in SF: van Vogt took some inspiration from real world events in Europe at the time, particularly the anti-Semitism in Germany. The idea of the majority of humanity persecuting a minority, one that has special powers that could save humanity, is now a SF trope: the X-Men are only one example. 

Anyway, I'm glad I read *Slan*, and not just for its historic legacy in SF and fandom.",0

1552,"The Left Hand of Darkness... what an incredible book (thoughts from a trans person)I just finished this book, the first Le Guin book I’ve read, and I’m at a loss for words.

I’m transgender, born male and currently live as female, beginning transition 2.5 years ago at age 22. I pass pretty much 100% of the time these days, which is nice and made me realize just how different the world is for different sexes. So of course I was attracted to this book as soon as I learned of the basic premise.

This book leans heavily into the idea of dualism, and how our society is lacking because of our requirement to separate one side from another, and how that prevents us from seeing the whole picture.

I work in healthcare, where sometimes I perform EKGs. When you have to do an EKG, you are naked waist up, something very uncomfortable for many women (understandably). And when I enter the room, they are often relieved that I’m a woman, as it would be uncomfortable if I was a man. It’s weird, and often I’m not even sure how to react. On one hand I love being seen as female, on another feeling treated differently as a result leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

So now I’m reading this book where gender has no impact on society since there is no binary gender, where fluidity is expected and cultivated, and the idea that “there would be no shadow without light” is common thought. 

It made me think of our society, one where I am treated differently just because of my looks on the outside. Where people, both men and women, are more comfortable telling me their feelings, their secrets, letting me become a more intimate part of their lives just because I now have long hair and wear makeup.

Life is a series of decisions based on previous presumptions, and this book reminded me of this in a way that left me too stunned to speak. There is no I if there is no you.

1557,"[Spoilers] Just finished The City &amp; The City, need to talk about itI really enjoyed it overall. 

I thought it was really weird how it started out with what seemed like an obviously supernatural premise and slowly pared it down to just a fantastical one.

I originally thought it was some kind of alternate-universes thing, where the two cities literally inhabited the same spaces and the veil wore thin in some places, but it turned out it was a purely psychological division upheld by a powerful social taboo. 

Even when I realized that, I thought there were still obvious supernatural forces at play, in the form of Breach and their ability to seemingly materialize out of thin air and the way everyone in the cities talked about them, but eventually it gets revealed that their invisibility/teleportation/whatever is just another psychological effect in the vein of the one that prevents residents of the cities from acknowledging their counterparts. 

Even the grand mystery of Orciny ends up being a front for a more-or-less mundane criminal conspiracy. There's a little tease at the end with the potentially magical Precursor Age artefacts, but that's never really confirmed or denied.

Ultimately, it's an interesting choice, and I'm not really sure how I feel about it. I found the heavy focus on the psychological nature of the division and Breach to be interesting, but the final resolution of the Orciny mystery gave me kind of a Scooby Doo vibe. Within the framework of the setting that the book created, I felt like we could have had a much more interesting resolution.

I haven't really read a lot of it or come across it, though.  (or if I have,  I guess I've mentally just filed it into another genre or just though of it as ""near-future SF"")

John Barlow, a racist and vulgar conman and real estate developer from 1988, accidentally ends up in suspended animation. He wakes up in the future. Society changed. Now the majority of intelligent people have been bred out by the dumb. There's a small minority of intelligent people but they feel oppressed by the majority because they have to do the significant heavy lifting to keep society running. So they want Barlow to fix this problem and so he demands to become world dictator. Apparently 20th century people are the only one's self interested enough to devise a plan. His plan is to convince all the morons 99% of people to nationalistically rush to Venus to become the first nation to colonize it. And it works using lessons he learned from Hitler and they all die in space. In the end, the intelligent people put him in a rocket too because they hate the self-interested, pragmatic and far-sighted people of the 20th century who created the problem in the first place. He dies.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is this story supposed to be satirizing? Unlike the story Fahrenheit 451, it can't be a commentary on culture, the morons are truly genetically inferior, not just distracted by popular entertainment. In fact it feels like its strongly endorsing prejudice against those with low intelligence. Or does it? After all Barlow is written very abrasively. A conman and racist that knows all about Hitler. So I would have expected the intelligent congress to stop his plan but they go along with it.  Perhaps this passage says it all

&gt;""This of it. You were a blind, selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic and social conditions which penalized child-bearing by the prudent and foresighted. You made us what we are today, and I want you to know that we are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damn-fool automobiles! Damn-fool cities with overhead ramps!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""As far as I can see,"" said Barlow, ""you're running down the best features of time. Are you crazy?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The rockets aren't rockets. They're turbo-jets—good turbo-jets, but the fancy shell around them makes for a bad drag. The automobiles have a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour—a kilometer is, if I recall my paleolinguistics, three-fifths of a mile—and the speedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think they're going two hundred and fifty. The cities are ridiculous, expensive, unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who'd be better off and more productive if they were spread over the countryside.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We need the rockets and trick speedometers and cities because, w**hile you and your kind were being prudent and foresighted and not having children, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were shiftlessly and short-sightedly having children—breeding, breeding.** My God, how they bred!""

Perhaps Kornbluth is just calling his fellow intelligentsia to have more babies to crowd out the migrant workers? Seems pretty classist though

Anyways, I wanted to see if anyone had thoughts about this:
One thing I really would have loved to see more of was how the language of the main body of the book, that Holsten and the Key Crew were speaking, was different from Imperial C. I would have really enjoyed Tchaikovsky unpacking a little bit about how language shifted over the 2,000 years between Kern's language and Key Crew language. Obviously, they could have just been different in the way Czech is different than English or whatever but it would be interesting to see in what ways Imperial C was like a language Key Crew was aware of in their own time. 

Additionally, I would have enjoyed seeing how Tribe language or shipborn language began to shift over the many years that passed. Even in out own time language shifts so much with new words, slangs, and pidgeons or with first generation immigrant families that adapt their language into given contexts. Surly this would happen across generations as well.",0

1569,"What I don’t like, what I like and what I find annoying about SF bookswhat I don’t like

Descriptions of hand-to-hand combat or sports.  Every time I read about these I imagine I am watching an action movie with a lot of scene cuts. I don’t know what’s happening.  I don’t get a mind’s view of the action. I don’t like them. What I like are different combat descriptions. In one book there was a action scene where the enemy used a tornado to destroy. In other scene another books used a crushed star to create beams. Fortunately there are few scenes like these in the books I read.

&amp;#x200B;

What I like

infodumps. This is what mainstream literary snubs hate about sf books. I love it when a book introduces a new term or something and then starts telling me a little bit about it. And then the book keeps telling me more and more about the thing in the next chapters. I am not a fan of “show don’t tell”. I think infodumps are necessary in sf books because of world building.

&amp;#x200B;

What I find annoying

sex scenes, love scenes or feelings scenes. Ok, I understand. Writers are humans writing about humans and humans do these things. When I read them I roll my eyes. They are a necessary evil. Fortunately there are just few of these scenes in the books I read. So what I saying is that I might not a fan of romantic or erotic science fiction.

1572,"Sci-fi exploring what it means to be human in a world with enhancement technologies?**Hi, can anybody please recommend some sci-fi novels where:**

1. **a significant theme (whether explicitly or by obvious implication) is the exploration of what it means to be a human, or to live/be treated as human ; AND**
2. **there exists technology that modifies/enhances the human in some way (biological/genetic engineering, cybernetics/cyborgs, etc).**

I am new to the sci-fi genre, but I am doing doctoral research on how the human is explored in sci-fi literature, and whether this can provide any valuable insights for the legal/ethical domain.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some examples of the way the above themes could be explored in an interesting way (but I'm open to anything else!):

1. where ""normal"" humans and modified humans are treated differently by others or their society (socially, politically, legally);
2. where a modified human has more/less rights, or tries to assert/fight for their rights;
3. where a modified human tries to become, or be treated like, a ""normal human"" (or vice versa);
4. where a person has to grapple with the changes that come with transitioning from one form to another;
5. where a person finds themself having to deal with the law or other authority structure (eg police, government), because of something relating to their being a modified or ""normal"" human;
6. (edit:) where society, authority or law tries to restrict the use/proliferation of the technology because it is perceived to be a threat (eg to the moral/social fabric of society).

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I'm reading *Brave New World* (comparing a bio-engineered civilization against the ""authentic"" human of old days), and *Man Plus* (a man grappling with his transition to cyborg).

1573,"Any Shadowrun fans out there? What are your favorites?I started reading the Shadowrun books recently (coming from the PC games) and have enjoyed them much more than I expected. I mean, they aren't 'literary' or anything but it's a fun, interesting universe. Fast pace, engaging environments. I didn't expect the mix of technology and magic to work as well as it does. I think it may benefit from starting out as a PnP RPG game, the lore feels very well thought out and developed. Probably also creates a good framework for authors to work with. Obviously, the writers have their differences, but all in all, the books fit together quite well IMO. I'm usually not such a fan of multiple authors working with the same universe, but so far so good. 

I've read the Secrets of Power trilogy (good place to start) and Dragonheart Saga trilogy as well as a few stand alone novels... of those, I especially enjoyed Worlds Without End (best read before the Dragonheart saga, though ok after too) as well as Dark Resonance. Fistful of Data was good fun. The only one that put me off was Burning Bright... which I liked fine until the last 10-15% and then the main character annoyed the fuck out of me.

I get that to am extent, one of the points being made by that is that history may view people and events through a different lens (and that in universe Ender wasn't considered ""tricked""), but I always felt that the sequels were also trying to make the point that it really wasn't the right thing to do. 

Unfortunately, I never really seem to see discussions around *that* specific point; i.e., do most readers think that if they were the commanders or politicians, they would have orchestrated something differently?

There are many things I love about the way KSR tells this story and I had a brilliant time reading this book. The story definitely felt thinner than in Red Mars but I enjoyed it and particularly loved the complexity of trying to build a new society. It couldn't be anything other than a total mess so I'm glad it was portrayed as such. 
 
A huge part of the appeal of these books is how realistic they feel, and a big part of that is the conflict between characters. There are so many perspectives on the future of Mars and the way they conflict and complement is so satisfying. It helps that he presents each perspective fairly and with at least some merit, so that despite my personal beliefs I feel sympathy for both sides of every argument. 
 
Maya was one of my favourite characters in this book. I was frustrated by her characterisation for the first two thirds - too much a caricature-  but once she got her PoV her complexity from Red Mars returned, better than ever. I find her a very compelling character. Part 9 is the longest of the book and I was very hesitant once I saw it was Maya’s perspective, but her time in Odessa was one of my favourite sections of the book. KSR really hit his stride with the gorgeous descriptions of the areoforming and Maya’s tortured relationship to her past and future. 
 
William Fort was a very intriguing character who I felt didn't get the screentime he deserved, although maybe that would have spoiled the mystery.

1595,"Just finished the Liu Cixin's masterful Three Body Problem series. Though I loved the books, I have one major problem with them (spoilers for The Three Body Problem, Dark Forest, and Death's End)Let me begin by saying that this series is one of best sets of print SF books I've ever read, and I say that as an avid fan of the genre.  It joins the like of the *Hyperion Cantos*, *A Scanner Darkly*, *Dune,* and the *Culture* books among my all time favorite PrintSF. But there's one surprising issue - **there are no believable romantic relationships in the whole series.**

It's actually striking how few relationships feature at all. The relationship between Yang Dong (the young physicist who commits suicide early on in *TBP*) and her boyfriend Ding Yi isn't really explored at all, not even in reflections, despite Ding Yi's prominence as an important character in *The Dark Forest*. The same is true of her mother, the brilliant physicist Ye Wenjie, and her husband, Yang Weining; despite some passages showing their professional relationship, we never get any real insight into their interpersonal dynamic, and barely a few pages after their marriage is reported, Yang is tumbling off a cliff. Protagonist of *TBP* Wang Miao has a wife and son, but they're not mentioned at all past Chapter 6, which struck me as a bit bizarre even while I was reading. I could go on and on through the other important characters in the series: Wade, Guan Yifan, Zhang Beihai, Da Shi, Rey Diaz, Fred Tyler - their romantic lives if mentioned at all are dealt with by a throwaway line about a divorce at most.

There are really only three romantic relationships spelled out in any detail: Wallfacer Bill Hines and his scientist wife Keiko; Cheng Xin, protagonist of *Death's End*, and her brainy admirer Yun Tianming; and Wallfacer Luo Ji and his 'dream girl' Zhuang Yan. All of these have big problems. Bill and Keiko are the closest we get to a normal relationship but they're not really *major* characters (plus, she is his Wallbreaker). As for Cheng Xin and Yun Tianming, well, it's not even really clear what kind of romantic feelings are there. Of course the relationship is never physically consummated in any way, but there's also no reason to think the characters know each other particularly well - big feelings, sure, but little in the way of calibration.

So let's talk briefly about Luo Ji and Zhuang Yan. This relationship puzzled me beyond belief. The idea of Luo Ji falling in love with a girl in his head was very nicely done, but it kind of undercut things when he 'found' her in real life. Despite a couple of nice scenes in the Louvre, we never get much of a sense of their interpersonal dynamic, or how their relationship grew over the years. And we never really get a picture of what they see in each other - Luo Ji has this intense desire to protect her, sure, but what's that based on? And why does she fall for him? There was great potential here to explore the mismatch between the idealised pictures of our partners we construct in our heads and the more complicated realities that result from conjoining two lives. For example, what if Zhuang Yan had turned out to have traits that Luo Ji found annoying, or less than perfect? What if he then realised the girl in his head also had these traits?

If this was a Western novel, I'd describe the depictions of romance as *adolescent* \- it's all beautiful smiles and sunlight glinting in hair, not the kind of complex processes of vulnerability, connection, understanding, and compromise that characterize actual real life relationships. However, as striking as the shallow nature of the relationships on display is the fact that they're largely absent.

Let me be clear here that I don't like it when romantic plots are forced into stories inappropriately, something that happens all the time in Hollywood. When there are great world-deciding crises unfolding, we don't need to have the hero and heroine decide to fall madly in love. But given that the pacing in the series includes many times and places where the crisis isn't looming (at least in the minds of the participants), as well as many characters in late youth or early middle age for whom family would seemingly be important, this absence doesn't seem to reflect a judicious choice on the part of the author as much as a slightly bizarre lacuna.

So I have a few thoughts. First, it could just be the character of the author - not everyone finds writing and reading about relationships interesting, and it's possible Liu Cixin doesn't have the patience or appetite to include them in his books (incidentally, I was surprised to learn that [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin#Personal_life), his wife and daughter don't read his work). 

Second, it could partly be a difference in genre style; my wife is from Asia and reads a lot of Chinese fiction, and while she hasn't read this series yet, she did suggest to me that explicit close-up ""psychologising"" of protagonists' romantic feelings is a stronger trait of the Western romantic tradition, with Asian authors leaving much more up to the imagination of the reader to fill out (Haruki Murakami - another of my favourite Asian authors - strikes me as an exception here, but perhaps he's a bit of an outlier stylistically).

Third, there's maybe a sexuality issue. However absent romance is from the series, sex is yet more absent - I can't recall a single time that a character has sex or even reflects on having done so in the past. At most we get references to lovers and a few awkward catcalls. Yet if you want to write good romance, you need to bring sex into play (unless you're Jane Austen, of course). Doing that narrows your audience base, perhaps, but also risks censorious judgment. I don't know enough about the culture around sex in China, but the little I know suggests to me that it's possible that Liu decided he'd have an easier time pitching and promoting his novel if he kept it clean.

I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this issue. I also have a final related puzzle: what the hell happened to Zhuang Yan and Luo Ji's daughter? The ending of *The Dark Forest* sets them up as a happy family, but they don't appear once in *Death's End*. I know we're told that they left Luo Ji two years after the Deterrence era began, and there are two interpretations as to why (namely he's an asshole, or he wanted to protect them), but the mystery created by this throwaway line is never resolved. Were they already dead and gone by the time of the Bunker Era? Didn't it occur to Luo Ji to get them - or his grandchild - onto the lightspeed ship, and save them from the solar system's destruction? It really felt like - much like Conan Doyle and Mrs Watson - Liu Cixin realised he'd created an extraneous narrative thread and hastily dropped it. That was a real disappointment to me, as it seemed like there was a lot of potential there.

Would love to hear the thoughts of other readers!",0

Did it live up to your expectations or change the way you read their work?I live in Nashville, and every year we have the Southern Festival of Books here in town. It's a pretty modest affair, and this is actually my first year attending. I didn't plan to go at all until I saw that Ted Chiang was a featured author and that he would be there. So, being a huge fan, I attended his event.

I figured he would do an interview-style session where a moderator sat down with him and the audience just listened, but instead, he gave a talk - more or less him reading aloud an essay he had written about the differences between science and magic. It was interesting; he went into how there's a distinct difference between the two and how intention and functionality and humanity help to make the distinction between them, rather than setting or time period.

It was also interesting to just see and hear him in person. Speaking for myself, certain powerful works can impact the way I think or view the world, so those works and their authors can often take on a larger-than-life persona in my head. But Ted was, of course, just a guy. Fast-talking and a little awkward. After his reading, he took audience questions and, during his responses, he said ""you know?"" a lot as a little vocal tick, similar to how people say ""uh"" or ""um."" Except, combined with his fast rate of speech, it came out as ""y'ow?"" which was funny to me. All of that to say, it's just refreshing to see and hear that these people we look up to, some of which have greatly impacted our lives, are just people too. It's inspiring.

If anyone is curious, during the Q&amp;A session, he answered my question (how do you overcome being a ""slow writer,"" as some people have called you?) by saying he agrees that he is a slow writer, but that he no longer thinks that's a negative thing. Some people write quickly, some people enjoy the process of writing or can't help but to write - but, for him, he does neither of those things, and he's only recently started to embrace that. And, as a slow writer myself, it was heartening to hear him say that and to see that Ted has become successful despite the fact.

1603,"Looking for some specific things... I thinkI'm a huge fan of scifi in general but I think maybe I'm a bit of a hypocrite. I've been trying to read more scifi lately but often I have a hard time getting into a book that just throws you into the middle of a foreign galaxy with weird terms and races and gobbledygook and basically no explanations of what those terms mean. It makes things seem superficial imo, like the author was trying really hard to insert culture into their work but just failed because there is no supporting lore. I try to give the benefit of the doubt but, I digress. 

The books I've read through and enjoyed the most lately are some of the halo books and the **Three Body** series, **Ball Lightning**, **Artemis** and **The Martian** for two different reasons, mainly, I think. 

First, they both are near enough into the future or take place in a form of humanity that is recognizable in technologies to me, and not so foreign that I don't even know what they're talking about.

Second, the new phenomena and technologies in these books seem to be explained very well so that a concept that I would have considered completely foreign actually seems natural to me. 

Examples of books that did not do this well, the **Hyperion** series, **Consider Phlebas**, **Expeditionary Force** (in the later books more so), and **The Collapsing Empire** series.

These two concepts together give these books a semblance of hard science. So I guess my question is, can you guys recommend some things that fall into this category? I will continue to try to branch out, because I think a lot of scifi not in this category also introduce very thought provoking ideas as well, but ya know.",0

I found the ending of the book strangely satisfying.  Tragic, but satisfying.  The build up of the train crash put a sense of tension and stress in my mind that I have rarely felt in a book before.  I think the closest I've felt to that is the reveal of MorningLightMountain in Pandora's Star.  

I do kind of wish the Mind had been expanded upon further.  Even in the Appendix, there wasn't really a mention of it and why it was so special, other than it ended up in charge of a starship I think? ( maybe I just missed that part?).  I was kind of expecting a ""The mind was recovered by the Culture and through its unorthodox method of thought, developed a new generation of starships to turn the tide of battle""  That's alright though without it. 

The fact that almost everyone met a tragic end helps set the tone for the rest of these novels for me - no one is safe, nothing is sacred.  I appreciate this.

OK, maybe one side hid their code in the archive so the other never got a chance to find and delete it. But in that case, how come a bunch of random people who walked in and started poking around got guided to the code for both the Blight and the Countermeasure within six months?

 This theory that data was secretly hidden is even more implausible when you consider that the researchers apparently didn't find anything else of interest in the meantime before the Blight and Countermeasure were created. So it seems reasonable to conclude that the Countermeasure and the Blight were the only significant items stored in the archive.

The archive must have been obscure if it lay hidden for so long before the High Lab was set up. It's a pretty big coincidence for the Blight &amp; the Countermeasure to end up in the same archive like this without one leading to the destruction of the other.",0

1615,"Greg Egan's Diaspora: Some confusions after finishingI just finished Diaspora. Great book! I especially thought the concept of Wang's carpets were amazing. And I really loved how he really embraced the change of values that these people have, with regards to how they perceive identity. They're not afraid of any of their physical forms dying, what they're afraid of is changing too much, especially if they leave one of their earlier copies in stasis, and not being able to re-merge, because that would be too much ""like"" dying. Or that making clones of yourself that differ in just enough of a way that they have no place anywhere is a major sacrifice, because you might ""be"" one of those clones.

But there were a few things about the cosmology (particularly the dimensional structure of the universe) that didn't make much sense to me, or at least wasn't consistent with the way the characters were behaving.

The way I understand it:

Our home 3+1 dimensional universe has the topology of a 4-sphere. And it has 6 microscopic closed dimensions (similar to the tiny dimensions in String Theory, which we do freely move through, and our particles vibrate through, but they're just so small that we don't notice them), which itself is shaped as a 6-sphere, and has the Lorentz signature -+++++ (so it has its own time dimension). Each point in our 4D spacetime is basically its own 6-dimensional universe that are independent of each other (beings in that universe can move freely through their 5 spatial dimensions, but not our 3 spatial dimensions; we're like a ""macro-sphere"" to them). Similarly, we have 6 ""macro"" dimensions (5+1 again), which is to us what we are to our micro-universes. So each point in the macro-6-sphere is its own 4D universe similar to ours (in terms of scale and dimensionality), but to all of our 4D universes there's only one macro-6-sphere universe. (This asymmetry bothered me for a while, until I realized that it's because we are micro-dimensions to them, so their objects *span* our 4 dimensions, but ours don't span theirs, we only span our own micro-dimensions.) However, the macro 6-sphere has its *own* macro-4 sphere, to which the size of its 6 dimensions are microscopic. So even though there's only one macro-6-sphere to all of our infinite 4-D universes, there's still infinite of those 6-spheres spanning the space of its macro 4-sphere. And this pattern basically goes on infinitely in both directions (towards the larger-scaled and smaller-scaled universes).

That's all well and good. However, the characters in the book often have ways of talking that conflict with this picture. This is not due to the fact that they didn't know the full picture until near the end, because often the things they said conflicted with what they already did know.

First of all, why did they treat every scale of universe as if it shared the same time dimension? The home universe is 3+1 dimensions, and the macro-sphere (the one that's one level ""above"" the home universe) is 5+1 dimensions, which is *separate* from the 3+1 of our universe. Our ""time"" is just part of the microscopic spherical universe that they don't notice in their universe, and their ""time"" is a totally separate dimension. Yet, characters often say things like that the Transmuters have been here for ""at least a billion years"", because they left the home universe a billion years ago. Or they can avoid the galactic core explosion in the home universe by ""waiting it out"" in the macrosphere... as if spending time in the macrosphere implies that the same time will have passed in the home universe. Or, in the last chapter, as Yatima and Paolo kept going ""up"" in layers (larger and larger universes), they keep agonizing over how much ""time"" has passed since they saw the people they knew. Yet they went through something like 10\^14 different ""time"" dimensions. Why would the time elapsed that they experience imply anything about the time elapsed that their friends experienced, if we're talking about different time dimensions?

This would have made more sense if the explanation for the cosmology was that the home universe is a 3-sphere, with a macro 5-sphere, that itself has a macro 3-sphere, etc... but those spheres all have +++ and +++++ metric signatures, and they all share the same ""time"" dimension, which is just an infinite line and not part of any of the spheres, but rather, is simply in Cartesian product with all of them. (Though I don't know if that's possible, while still preserving relativistic dynamics in each universe.) But that's not how it was explained. It was explained more like my ""recap"" above, as far as I can tell. 

Secondly, what happens to the tiny universes when you just ""move"" through the space that they occupy? I assume that the ""home universe"" is in the middle of the vacuum of space in the macro 6-sphere and will never have to worry about anything in the macro-universe touching it, just by sheer probability (the ratio of ""stuff"" to empty space). And this is true of the vast majority of universes. But what happens when a Polis just flies through a point in empty space that's never been touched before, as with most points they fly through? Does it essentially crash through that universe like a wrecking ball? And all of its infinite micro-universes? And all *their* micro universes, etc? I don't remember if the book actually addresses this. But for characters that are afraid to land nano-probes on a planet because it might disrupt the life there, it seems odd that they're not worried about destroying infinite universes every time they occupy a new infinitesimal point in space.

Finally, I guess this is nitpicky, and not important to the story at all. But when writing Diaspora, was Greg Egan aware that [Lorentzian manifolds with an even number of dimensions cannot be n-spheres?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44861/for-which-b-it-is-possible-that-sn-can-have-a-lorentz-metric-why)",0

I am not looking for purple prose here.  I'd just like to immerse myself in a story that allows me to see the setting clearly in my mind's eye.  I don't like Anne Rice's stories but her prose is a perfect example of what I'm looking for:

&gt;Mona was looking through the glass window at the swamp, at the ragged, tilting trees, sickly and strung with moss, at the vines snarled like ropes around the huge old cypresses. Out there in the light of the moon she could see patches of water through the covering of still duckweed, and the knees of the cypress trees, so many dangerous spikes sticking up all around the thick trunks of the old trees. And black things, little black things flying in the night. Could be roaches, but don’t think about it!

**1. Ryk Brown - The Frontiers Saga**

Humanity is recovering from a Bio-Digital plague that sent earth and its colonies to the stone age. Earth again starts to gain access to deep space travel and finds the colonies are also advancing with some worrying developments. This series follows the crew of the ship Aurora.

**2. Sudipto Majumdar -  Shaitan Wars**

A book of earths first contact with aliens and the battle of survival that follows. This book can be a little tech/science heavy at times but you do also get to see things from the aliens POV and they are alien in that they smell the universe as they use touch and smell to communicate. I think this should class as hard sci-fi as the travel is all sub light speed and no tech (currently 5 books in) that is beyond imagination.

**3. Star Force - Aer-ki Jyr** 

This is like a cross between mass effect, star wars and Jurassic park. If you like empire building this will be for you. There are like over a hundred books with a word count in the millions, you get to follow a group of teens and a business man as they create a galactic empire over tens of thousands of years. The main characters do not age for certain reasons so you get to follow them and more as this progresses. The cost of these books can add up so I would recommend kindle unlimited as they are all on there. I will say the books are not perfect some you could skip, mainly at the start once the author gets going this gets ironed out and the story always progresses. The author releases 1 book a month like clockwork so if you want something long term to sink your teeth into give it a try.

It's an almost pure cyberpunk novel, and through the first act I wasn't sold on it, because it does feel quite often like a straight up pastiche of early William Gibson, down to little details like a focus on naming high end fashion brands. But as it goes I feel like it finds its footing and opens out into a little more of its own conceptual space,and it ended up going some interesting places. Stylistically and thematically it's still very much an ""if you wish Gibson had kept writing Sprawl trilogy books"" kind of work, and I wouldn't say I was blown away or anything, but if you like non grimdark cyberpunk with classic themes of AI, extreme economic disparity, life extension, and memory/identity it's worth picking up.

1632,"A question about Revelation Space?I have a question concerning Captain Brannigan (as a Futurama fan that name makes me laugh every time). I’ve only read Revelation Space and Chasm City.  I would like to know what affliction that Captain Brannigan has? I assumed it was melding plague but am not sure. I have not read the rest of the inhibitor trilogy and want to avoid spoilers, so if it is revealed later please just tell me the book title. Thanks fellas.",0
1633,"Any Nick Harkaway fans? Finished Gnomon a few days ago and my mind is still reeling.Gnomon is probably the best book I've read to date. I absolutely loved the shit out of it and cannot wait to re-read it in a few months. The world and maze of a story was incredible, and once I got a hang of his vocabulary I loved how humorous, distinct, and intelligent each character was in their respective stories. I didn't piece everything together until the reveal in the end, yet I was never exactly lost throughout the book; I felt like it was just really well written and paced. The book kind of felt like *Lost*, but if Lost was actually good and coherent. There was so many themes and layers, and nothing was really as it seemed, even when thinking back on it now after completion. It had very real themes about surveillance, autonomy, and our place in this ever increasing data manipulated world, and it had philosophical themes about the very nature of reality itself. I wish I could do the book justice with my praise, but I'm not a very good writer and this book just had so, so much going on with it. 

I'm wondering which book of his I should read next: Angelmaker, The Gone-Away World, or Tigerman, or any other recommendations from authors with a similar prose and humor.",0
1634,"Classic sf authors?I just moved and there's a three story thrift store in my town. It happens to have an entire story dedicated to books with a large selection of sf. So my question is what are some good authors to watch for when I'm there? I'm thinking in the vein of Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, things of that ilk. Thanks in advance!!",0
1635,"Hive Queen /Hive Mind Protagonist?I am looking for stores where the Protagonist or very important character is either an Hive Queen or an Hive Mind.

**Hive Queen:** A Biological or Technological Being that produces one way or the other numerous amounts of Offspring. Some of them are able to take over their drones and control them others only specialize in producing more.  Their goals can be different but the goal to expand exists for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hive Mind:** A Being that is able to control multiple Beings at the same time. It may be in every Controlled at the same time or only able to switch whenever he wants it. Additionally it´s possible to ""programm"" Controlled so that it doesn´t have to waste it´s ressources to everybody.

Dungeon Cores don´t count as Hive Queens.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn´t matter in what time it plays or what Setting it has. It can even be Superhero where one of the Main Characters has those properties.

I generally prefer darker themes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that in Enders Game there was something akin to a hive Queen, however I didn´t like how they were depicted in the movie AND they would have to have way more Screentime to be viable and not just some enemy, who gets mentioned rarely.",0
1636,"Recommend me REALISTIC and MYSTERIOUS sci-fi (mostly first contact)Loved:

- Rendezvous with Rama (haven’t and won’t read the sequels)

- Blindsight (didn’t care for the vampires though)

- Revelation Space (sort of first contact, and super mysterious)

- Tau Zero (“realistic” with sufficient suspension of disbelief, hated the ending which is ridiculous)

Didn’t love:

- Mote in God’s Eye (teddy bears leaning human language over the course of 20 pages and live in human-like cities and drive cars aren’t very “alien”, not sure why this is getting rave reviews)

- Seveneves (there’s some first contact with separately evolved humans in the final few pages which is sort of cool but the first part on the ISS is mostly boring and the final part 5000 years in the future is ridiculous)

Haven’t listed other sci-fi I’ve read which doesn’t fit what I’m looking for anyway (Hyperion, Dune, Fountains of Paradise, ...)

1638,"Looking for mathematical science fiction, preferably something that involves dimensions and fractalsHello,

I am looking for something on the lines of the dimension folding touched upon in 3 Body Problem. On dimension and mathematical side, I have only read Abbott's Flatland. I haven't read any Rudy Rucker stuff yet, I intend to check them soon. 

Though Flatland was interesting, I remember it overwhelming me while reading. Something book/story where the dimension thing forms part of the narrative (like 3BP) than something that forms the whole narrative itself (Flatland) would be good, if you guys know any. I also remember this Liven story from Convergent stories that amused me in this line.

So, looking for sci fi involving complex or unconventional mathematics and geometry preferably dimensions. Thank you.",0
1639,"“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” - My take on Fall; or, Dodge in Hell by Neal StephensonNo Spoilers. 

I was initially hesitant to read Fall; or, Dodge in Hell because I had heard it was long and meandering, and not in a good way. But now, that I'm at the end I really appreciate it. 

As I came to the end of the book I felt that it was the closest I've ever seen a book come to actually creating a universe. 

And I'm not saying other books haven't done similar things, I just can't think of any right now. 

If anyone has any recommendations for other books that are similar in concept, please share.",0

1642,"Looking for some brain candy reading.Like the title says, I'm looking for something fun to read before bed.  Something with a lot of slam bang action, high melodrama and big space ships for the eight year old in me who used to watch stuff like Star Wars and Robotech.

1643,"I'm fishing for stories where protagonist isn't the savior/chosen one/hero-of-the-world?Do any stories come to mind where the protagonist isn't Aragorn or Neo or R'hollor, or any type of prophesied hero/underdog who rises up to save the world?

I'm trying to find a protagonist who may or may not even have an objective; or perhaps the objective is simply to survive and maintain their quality-of-life. It seems almost every IP I come across in 2019 has to be this epic journey of insurmountable odds where the lowly scrub/prince-that-was-promised becomes the galactic hero and alters the course of history of the entire galaxy.

Are there any good fictions in this genre where the protagonists are just *people*? Ir perhaps the impact of this protagonists journey just effects a very small subset of people?",0
1644,"I just shotgunned Gene Wolfe's entire Solar Cycle in one enormous yawning binge-read.Literally decades and decades of his writing career, and I consumed the whole thing in a couple of months.  Holy wow but that was some amazingly-satisfying reading. Everyone should read those stories.

I never thought that at this point in my life, I'd be able to experience a wonderful, vast new story for the very first time, but here I am.  Finishing it was the same feeling I got when I finished *The Chronicles of Narnia* when I was a little kid, or the *Gormenghast* stories in my 20s, or *Red/Green/Blue Mars* in, well, my late 20s.

So what should I read next?  I'm thinking *Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers* by Harry Harrison would be a nice chaser.  Or should I revisit the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?",0
1645,"Month of September Wrap-Up!What did you read last month, and do you have any thoughts about them you'd like to share?

Whether you talk about books you finished, books you started, long term projects, or all three, is up to you. So for the slower readers or those who have just been too busy to find the time, it's perfectly fine to talk about something you're still reading even if you're not finished.

1646,Orthogonal Trilogy by Greg EganWhat do you think about it? The whole basic premise of another universe with different set of physics laws and what is the consequences for the existence and life in there enchanted me.,0
1647,"Finding Void Star ExhaustingAfter reading so much praise on here and generally loving the Sprawl Triology/Gibson, I got Void Star and dug in. But then I hit a wall. I got so sick of paragraphs being 2 rambling, run on, overly verbose sentences to describe simple shit and then that sickness turned to annoyance. Is that how people really think Gibson wrote and/or cyberpunk should be written. Most of the metaphors are rather poor and none of them paint a powerful mental image. If anything, Gibson was the opposite and was able to write a simple sentence that would make you think as much as multiple paragraphs.

Does it speed up or get better? Does the writing style ever just catch on?",0

1650,Space opera like Lost StarshipJust finished the Lost Starship and enjoyed but feel there are better series like it out. Any recommendations?,0
1651,"More books that just feel.... depressing?I just finished the Lord of the Rings series, and I'm looking for something kind of like this. At first the books seem relatively light hearted and almost fun, but the more you get into it the more you realize that this is a burden that very well could kill these people. They didn't ask for it, they don't really want it, but they've accepted it nonetheless and they intend to see it through, regardless of the cost. 

I'm not exclusively looking for fantasy, scifi is great too. I want something that places weight on the main characters shoulders, and really just makes you feel fucking bad for them. Another good example of this is the anime Neon Genesis. You just feel really bad for the characters.",0
1652,"Linda Nagata - The Bohr MakerIve read a number of Linda Nagata’s books, such as The Red series and The Last Good Man, and had this idea of her writing as being this serious, laser-focused, no-nonsense near-future milSF. The discussions Ive had with others on here about her work seemed to indicate that was their impression as well. 

So color me quite surprised when I checked out her first novel, *The Bohr Maker* (which won a ~~hugo~~ locus award) and its this incredible bonkers off the wall inventive far-future tech fever dream, almost like Rajaniemi‘s *Quantum Thief* mixed with Stephenson’s *Diamond Age*, or Zelazny, or heck, Anime! And there are 3 more in this series, Im Very Stoked to read. 

Anyway, big recommend. Both for if you are a fan of her more recent style, and also if you are not. Its about as different as you can possibly get. IMO... way better. I enjoy milSF, but this stuff here is like primo big idea SF wildness 👌👌",0

1654,"Looking for a space SF BookHi, so I'm looking for like a spacey-sciencey book. I'm looking for something similar to say, Ad Astra (Movie), Interstellar (Movie), The Martian, or Artemis. I just want a fantastic book like the Martian where you really feel connected to the main character throughout the story line, and it's just hard set in Astronomy-based science, and set in the near future (like the martian). Basically, I'm just looking for books that are very similar to The Martian and Interstellar in the way that it's written and the science and the realism behind it. Thank you for the suggestions in advance

Edit: if this makes it more specific, I like books where it presents you with a fear of the unknown, not knowing what will happen per se.",0
1655,"I love feminist sci fi but I really struggled with The Power by Naomi AldermanSpoilers below probably? I would love to hear why others did or didn’t enjoy this book.

Here’s some of the things that were hard for me:

- If the point is to demonstrate the arbitrariness and brutality of patriarchy by creating a mirror version of it where women are the perpetrators of violence and subjugation, who is the audience of this book really intended to be? I don’t really need to be shown or reminded how terrible patriarchy is because as a woman I’m in it all the time, so the scenes of mindless hordes of women raping and pillaging were hard to stomach. Or was the message just that power always corrupts? The old trope could have been portrayed in a less traumatic way.

- There appeared to be a lot of gender biological essentialism when it came to the power women got. I get that the book seemed to be trying to de-stabilize some sense of essentialism especially by the ending where notions of men’s ‘biologically superior strength’ and women’s ‘biological tendency towards nurturing’ were turned on their heads. But then why go in for the very physically originated ‘power’ of the skeins, born I’m assuming only to cis-women? Ryan, one of the few men portrayed as having a skein, was chocked up to chromosomal issues, again biology. Who’s on top of the gender power hierarchy is just who has more physical power feels pretty hollow.

- Overall, the characters and their development felt like it took a back seat to descriptions of changes to society that felt a bit like a sledgehammer with the fierce pace of changes (10 years?!).

Change my mind?",0
1656,"Books featuring a Hellenic-style warrior hero, but in Space/The-Future?I'm not actually sure this is a genre.  

Here's what I'm curious to fine:  Books featuring the exploits of singular or a handful of warrior-heroes who wade through hordes of enemies and/or frequently find themselves racing to their doom against insurmountable odds, set in space.     

Basically, something like the Master Chief, or Commander Shepard, from their respective videogames.   

I know there's a lot of military scifi  and some Space Opera that borders on this idea, but doesn't quite get there.   

For example,  Felix from John Steakley's **Armor** is like what I'm thinking of,  but most of the main characters from other starship-troopers-style books are not (because they're surrounded by peers basically just like themselves, they're not exceptional in their own element.  Johnny Rico isn't exceptional as a warrior, just  a good leader, etc)  

Colonel Kassad from the Hyperion Cantos qualifies too, but of course, I've already read those.  

No 40k recommendations, thanks.  I've already read dozens of those, and I'm not feeling the grimdark.   Yes, I've already read most of the Halo tie-in books. 

I read *The Light Brigade* by Kameron Hurley recently and that almost qualified, although Dietz's exceptional-ness was more about the ability to command the Light to do what she wanted, rather than actually being a Hellenic-style scifi-warrior-hero.  

Is there anything like this out there?   Or is this something that is mainly confined to just videogame protagonists?",0
1657,"Books that deal with alternate or multiple realities?I have been reading through a collection of Philip K.

I saw this pocket book with giant robotic ants. It was Tom Swift and the Microbots by Victor Appleton. Took me a week to read it all (i think it was just around 180 pages) but I was hooked. I kept asking my mom to buy all of them Tom Swift books.

Eventually, I picked my first real novel years later. It was Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn. It was a thick juicy book that I thoroughly enjoyed.",0

1663,"A particular fiction about aliens speculating about the enigma of humansYo PrintSF, So Honestly I have done a shit ton of research about this book but can't find it. My buddy told me about it and I figured I might as well ask here since by definition the book seems to fit the idea of SF.   


 The basic synopsis is that the whole set of stories takes the perspective of alien cultures/creatures looking at humanity, really impressing upon the strangeness of humans. In this universe, they are this weird, crazy and dangerous race to the aliens, but also a deep enigma to them. They can't seem to understand how the humans work and why they do things. It explores lots of the things that humans just naturally do, and the aliens are confused about it, like how we consume fucking poisons for fun (alcohol, nicotine, etc). In fact for that topic there's a whole story about an alien hanging out with a human and watching as they drink alcohol, he wants to try it to but is told he can't because he doesn't have a liver, and it's poison.   


There's even a war where the humans get  paid to fight another race, and they do so, the war ends in political discourse, then the humans befriend the race they were warring because they are both predators and understand each-other more and respect each-other. 

&amp;#x200B;

It even explores the aliens confusion at how we have nature preserves instead of fucking taking EVERYTHING and moving on. How we went into space cause we just wanted to rather than having drained the planet of resources. It's a really fun idea because a lot of the other aliens are herbivores trying to understand what the fuck these humans are and why they act the way they do. It honestly sounds really well made and I was wondering, does anyone know what this is?",0

Years ago I read a book by Scott Sigler named Earthcore.  It was absolutely fantastic.  It mixes sci-fi with intellectual genius in a realistic way.

Here is a summary:

&gt; Deep below a desolate Utah mountain lies the largest platinum deposit ever discovered. A billion-dollar find, it waits for any company that can drill a world's record, three-mile-deep mine shaft. EarthCore is the company with the technology, the resources and the guts to go after the mother lode. Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company's driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.
&gt;But at three miles below the surface, where the rocks are so hot they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries. Waiting ...and guarding. Kirkland and EarthCore are about to find out first-hand why this treasure has never been unearthed.  *-https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/303110.Earthcore

My wife and I are going on a 3,000+ mile road trip this Fall, so we're gonna be hitting Audible something fierce! To that end, I'm looking for the right science fiction audiobook that will work for both of us. Got any good recommendations?

---

***Me***: I've been reading scifi for as long as I can remember – often toward the harder end, but I definitely love a good ole romp as well. Here's a brief smattering of some of the SF books I've recently enjoyed the most:

* **Neal Stephenson** – probably my favorite author. I loved **Seveneves**, **Cryptonomicon**, **Diamond Age**, **Anathem**, probably more
* **Three Body Problem series by Liu Cixin** – The first book was a bit of a slog in the beginning, but then it picked up *just* enough to get me to to read the sequel. LOVED the series from there!
* **Children of Time/Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky** – Suuuuper into this series right now, and I've been recommending it to everybody who'll listen! Can't wait for another sequel.
* **Red Rising series by Pierce Brown** – This lives a bit along the scifi/fantasy border, and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. 
* **The Expanse Series by James S. A. Corey** – I absolutely *devour* these novels. Certainly on the softer side, and I love the characters, love the plot.

***Wife***: Doesn't typically read SF, or any fiction for that matter. She does like to think and talk about big-picture/philosophical issues, so I've been extolling SF's unique ability to raise such issues and push the reader into new areas of thought. I have one data point for her: we listened to **The Martian by Andy Weir** on our last road trip and she *loved* it!",0
1670,"Man-Kzin WarsAm I the only one that thinks it's crazy how hard it is to find any of the MKW books?

1673,"Red Mars is unsurprisingly fantasticI know Red Mars is considered a sci-fi classic, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy it, but I was impressed by how brilliant this book is. Its defining characteristic has to be how incredibly real everything feels. The technology, the politics, the planet itself, it's all so believable that this could be a historical account. There's plenty of social complexity in sci-fi but this book does it particularly well - the conflicts between nations and ideologies and visions served the plot fantastically. The science (which I sometimes find wanting in sci-fi) was very thorough - perhaps too much, although I did enjoy the pages-long tangents. 

The story covered a much larger timespan than I expected, but I assume he had to get to a point where the next book could take off. The journey to Mars, establishment of Underhill, expansion of the human impact on Mars, immigration, increasing political conflict, and (unsurprisingly catastrophic) revolution all flowed very smoothly and made total sense as the first 35 years on Mars. 

There were some great characters (especially Nadia, Arkady, and John) but some PoVs were less engaging than others, which is probably my biggest criticism. Ann was so miserable and Frank so bitter that it was sometimes a struggle to read their sections. That said, I really appreciated how he instilled the characters’ emotions in the reader - I felt Nadia's excitement, Ann’s and Michel's depression, Frank's frustration very clearly. 

I'm going to take a short break before jumping into ~~Blue~~ Green Mars. Quick question for you: I know KSR has written other books, so what do you think of them?

Edit: almost forgot to say that I think it's amazing how much this book doesn't feel like it was written in the early 90s. If it had been published this year I don't think very much would have changed. I also just figured out that Green Mars is actually the second book, so I’ll make sure to read that one next. Seems like Blue should come first but I guess it will make sense.",0

1678,"Multi-POV third-person limited omniscient is the worst part of modern SF IMOThere is a place for every POV. Even my least favorite POV, second person, is perfect in video games and choose-you-own adventure books. I enjoy basically any POV if it suits the story. There is a narrative style that I am growing to hate and it seems to be everywhere in modern science fiction.  It is the Multi-POV 3rd person.
 
The author shows us a scene, usually a decently long one to start, then just at a climatic moment (The enemy is attacking, or the ship is about to crash, or a character reveals they have made an immense scientific breakthrough)  they shift focus to an entirely new character. They spend some time introducing that character then it is on to a third. Styles vary but you are usually following 4-5 storylines by the hundred-page mark. With space epics your author will often introduce new species, worlds, customs, and technologies along with the dozen characters. More than being confusing it is just bad storytelling. We aren’t given time to get to know characters and get invested in the narrative before jumping off to follow another.

It can be done well. Look at Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire as an example. I would use a science-fiction book if I could think of one that did this well. The series starts out with nearly all of the characters we will be following together in Winterhold. It establishes the relationships of the various characters by, go figure, having them interact with one another.  Even the only character not present, Daenerys, is supremely focused upon the Iron Throne so we never feel lost as it how the stories fit together.

That is what is missing with sci-fi epics. It seems as if every time I read one written in this style the threads of the stories take forever to weave themselves together. If it is a multi-book epic some of the storylines are still off on their own tangent when the book closes. Even when there are multiple entries in a series they should each have their own complete narrative arcs that resolve at the end of each entry. I think the Ender Series is an excellent example of this idea.

  Why is this happening? Are these authors being forced to write like this by their publishers?

The stories themselves aren’t bad, but I feel taken advantage of when an author assumes I will read two-hundred pages of set-up before two of the main characters even meet and begin the narrative arc in earnest. Am I alone in this? I would very much like to get your thoughts. Thank You.",0
1679,"Which printSF locations have you stumbled on to?I loved Clifford Simak, especially  *A Heritage of Stars.* There's a bit in it (I think it was that one) where the team hide on an island in the middle of a river, and bandits are on the bank above. It's really well described. I was driving through Minnesota heading West from the Twin Cities and there was a place that looked exactly as described, I don't know if it was really what inspired him but I had a real flash of recognition like it was  place I knew myself, and I know he was from that area.

The bravest of them can jump between bodies when they near one another. At some point, the main character jumps to another one, and pursues an animal far up a tree that grows all over a large asteroid, in some sort of coming of age ritual. At the same time, other humans who are advanced are traveling in a ship away from earth. They eventually meet up with the main character, who is revealed to have evolved into a form well-suited to low gravity and is like 10 or 12 feet tall. They put him in a water tank to allow him to withstand the gravity associated with acceleration, and I believe they had that water tank because there was a sentient dolphin.

1701,"After not feeling Endymion, I thoroughly enjoyed Rise of Endymion[Spoilers]As a huge fan of Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion, I found Endymion mediocre. I appreciated the worldbuilding but characters(except de Soya) were boring and it was basically a road trip story.

On the other hand, Rise of Endymion was a similar experience to Fall of Hyperion. Characters became more interesting(turns out messiah doing messiah stuff is more engaging than her travelling on a boat), most of the questions were answered and the Cantos had a satisfying conclusion.

My opinions of common criticisms:

* **Raul and Aenea romance:** I get why people consider it creepy since they meet when Aenea is 12 and Raul is 30+. I agree that there was no reason Aenea couldn't be a few years older. However their first interaction is a quick light kiss initiated by Aenea(16) and the next time they meet she is 21. So I'm not too weirded out in that regard but Raul still calling her ""kiddo"" after that was off putting. 

* **Raul is a stupid yokel:** I agree that he fits the stereotype and feels out of place in a story with AIs, androids, poets, priests, scholars, messiahs, commanders  and mutants but maybe that's the point. He is the normal non-cruciform non-ouster non-AI human to Aenea's extraordinary Void using part-human part-AI divine being. I didn't enjoy his characters until the last 300 pages but in the end it clicked. Also he can be blamed for being ignorant but whenever he asks a question Aenea just dismisses him, which was one of the most frustrating part of the series for me.

* **Too much scenery:** I too cringed when Dan Simmons described mountains for 15 pages straight or named 24 people(4 of which truly mattered) in a single paragraph. I too disliked that when reading but now that I finished the book I accept it as part of Simmons' message. *""Life should be varied, life should be everywhere and every single life matters.""* He (and Raul after accessing the Void) wouldn't sound so sincere if minor characters were dismissed as unimportant. I still think it's a legitimate criticism but it doesn't bother me.

* **Rachel/Moneta:** I heard people disliked her part of the book so I was expecting some weird twist that made her a villain or something. I don't get the criticism. Is it because we didn't see the far future she and Kassad fights Shrike?",0

 “A post-apocalyptic tale about the power of art and the urgency of human  connection...cements Pinsker's status as a rising star in the world of  speculative fiction. A gorgeous novel that celebrates what can happen  when one person raises her voice.”**—Kirkus (starred review)** 

 “Let freedom ring in the growl of an angry guitar chord! Sarah Pinsker’s *A Song For a New Day*  is an absorbing tale of a quiet, all-too-believable American dystopia  in which a passion for music becomes the secretive, surprising seed of  rebellion.”—**Linda Nagata, Nebula Award winning author of** ***The Last Good Man*** 

 “An all-too plausible version of the apocalypse, rendered in such  compelling prose that you won’t be able to put it down...a lively and  hopeful look at how community and music and life goes on even in the  middle of dark days and malevolent corporate shenanigans.”—**Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and author of** ***Get In Trouble***   


""You'd better keep a copy of *A Song for a New Day*  with you at all times, because this book will help you survive the  future. Sarah Pinsker has written a wonderful epic about music,  community, and rediscovering the things that make us human. Pinsker has  an amazing ear for dialogue, a brilliant knack for describing music, and  most importantly a profound awareness of silence, in both its positive  and negative aspects. *A Song for a New Day* restored some of my faith in community, and I didn't even realize how much I needed this book right now."" –**Charlie Jane Anders, national bestselling author of** ***All the Birds in the Sky*** **and** ***The City in the Middle of the Night***

I admit, personally, after reading *Hyperion* and *Fall* thereof largely due to the multitude of recommendations endlessly shotgunned across this subreddit, I was deeply disappointed. I thought them achingly pretentious and rather dated, not half as clever as Simmons clearly believes it all to be, and the obsession with Keats felt faintly pathetic in its scrabbling for literary credibility - *""We're a* real *genre now, guys! Take me seriously!""*

To be clear, I understand that many people probably quite enjoy them, and find them really fascinating and thought-provoking. But they're nothing like the stand-out exemplars that a chunk of this subreddit often makes them out to be.

So, why? Why is always Dan fucking Simmons, and not any of the plethora of far superior classics with which our favoured genre is flush? Why is it not Banks? Or Le Guin? Or Gibson? Or Stephenson? All of them share at least a few traits with Simmons' work, and all of them are (IMO) vastly superior authors, whose works feel vastly more relevant to the modern sci-fi landscape.

The characters felt pretty thin and if I'm honest some of the vignettes were a bit disjointed/disconnected from the bigger picture, but each one was short enough that you never had to deal with the less interesting ones for long. I also think it's one of the few books that could have been about 100 pages longer, because honestly some of the vignettes hinted at some fascinating developments but felt very underexplained, especially towards the latter half of the story. I'd probably give it a solid 3.5 or 4/5.

Even though it's far from a perfect book, it had some wildly original ideas/memorable setpieces in it that I think could have easily been turned into novels of their own. I don't want to spoil them in the main post because it is a fairly short book and I think many people here would find it interesting, but I'm curious to hear if anyone else has ever checked this one out.

EDIT: One final note to anyone who does read this book - there's a timeline at the beginning but I suggest skipping that because it basically spoils the main developments/plot reveals. I'm not sure why this timeline wasn't in the back of the book or made to be less spoilery but I definitely do think it's better to just skip it and discover things as they happen.",0
1730,"Books like _Kiln People_ with an Emphasis on Widespread Cloning and its Effects on WorkI am currently reading _Kiln People_ by David Brin and I am really enjoying the type of cloning that is described in the book where the clones are these golem/android/cloned-human entities that can be created or destroyed on a whim by their originals and that exist to take the burden of work off of regular flesh-people.

I am wondering if there are any other books that take a similar approach to cloning as this one does. I am also open to purely virtual clones as seen in cyberpunk works such as those by Greg Egan like _Permutation City_ and _Diaspora_.

While I am aware of the existence of _House of Suns_ I do not believe that it matches what I am looking for due to it being more of a space opera focused story rather than focusing mainly on the forking and reintegration of individual personalities through various types of cloning. Then again I never actually read past the first few chapters of _HoS_ so maybe it does fit what I'm looking for. Either way I am not looking for that as a recommendation, nor do I need Greg Egan recommended to me as I am well aware of and have read a few of his works already.

1737,"I'm glad I decided to finish BlindsightI didn't like the prologue and the prose was rather bland and choppy at first, but at least I could understand what was happening. Next there were pages just describing the interior of Theseus and then confusing talk of Heaven. At that point I was almost about to stop reading, but I continued because this book is so often recommended. I am glad I did because the rest of the book is so good. I was gradually hooked after Siri is selected for the mission and finished the book the next day. I loved the central philosophical questions at the core of the novel, the suspense, the descriptions of  the alien biology, and even the fake quotes interspersed between chapters.

1738,"My favorite passage from Blindsight (mild spoilers) it's almost poetichttps://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm

&gt;I am unmanned. I am disposable. I am souped-up and stripped-down, a telematter drive with a couple of cameras bolted to the front end, pushing gees that would turn meat to jelly. I sprint joyously toward the darkness, my twin brother a stereoscopic hundred klicks to starboard, dual streams of backspat pions boosting us to relativity before poor old Theseus had even crawled past Mars.

&gt;But now, six billion kilometers to stern, Mission Control turns off the tap and leaves us coasting. The comet swells in our sights, a frozen enigma sweeping its signal across the sky like a lighthouse beam. We bring rudimentary senses to bear and stare it down on a thousand wavelengths.

&gt;We've lived for this moment.

&gt;We see an erratic wobble that speaks of recent collisions. We see scars—smooth icy expanses where once-acned skin has liquefied and refrozen, far too recently for the insignificant sun at our backs to be any kind of suspect.

&gt;We see an astronomical impossibility: a comet with a heart of refined iron.

&gt;Burns-Caufield sings as we glide past. Not to us; it ignores our passage as it ignored our approach. It sings to someone else entirely. Perhaps we'll meet that audience some day. Perhaps they're waiting in the desolate wastelands ahead of us. Mission Control flips us onto our backs, keeps us fixed on target past any realistic hope of acquisition. They send last-ditch instructions, squeeze our fading signals for every last bit among the static. I can sense their frustration, their reluctance to let us go; once or twice, we're even asked if some judicious mix of thrust and gravity might let us linger here a bit longer.

&gt;But deceleration is for pansies. We're headed for the stars.

Surely it would make more sense if they were all along a single line of latitude, because then the Earth's rotation would have taken care of the rest (and this is how it was done in the official adaptation of the novel into a Roleplaying game 'Stalker, the Sci Fi Roleplaying Game').

Since then I have gotten more interested in space technology. Early this year I was watching a youtube video (smartereveryday) and he reccomended seveneves in the audible plug. He read the first line and I was hooked. 

Seveneves in my opinion was just mind blowing, only slightly held back by its built in sequel (its third part). After finishing this book I was desperate to find another amazing book (still my favorite).

Aurora filled a hole that seveneves left, it was a slow starter but I thouroughly enjoyed the entire book, the idea of a living ship was beautiful.

Saturn Run was also really good hardSF. The research was incredible and had really interesting characters

Delta-V came out of nowhere and was another book I just couldn't put down. I am desperately awaiting a sequel.

I would really appreciate any suggestions for books similar to the 4 I have listed above and I hope that maybe some others will find the books I have suggested equally amazing as I have.

1777,"Looking for well-written Kindle Unlimited SFMy budget is tight, but I do have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. I can read any book in the program for free. A lot of indie SF authors publish there, but many of them are crappy. Looking for the good stuff: original, not formulaic, fun. I love space operas, but not dystopias. I don't like formulaic military SF (Aircraft Carriers in SPAAAAAACE!), but I do like original military SF. I like good world-building, too.

Indie books I've liked have included The Bobiverse serries, Teleport This!, The Union Station series. What I'd REALLY like is something comparable to Ian M Banks' Culture series. Or the Chronicles of Amber. Or the Foundation series.

1778,"Looking for slice-of-life speculative fiction.These days (honestly for over a year now, it's a slow journey), I've been rereading the Lord of the Rings. When I first read it twenty years ago, I thought the start in the Shire was boorish, but now I found it one of my favourite parts. 

I'd love to read more books that focuses on the bizarre day to day events in fictional settings. 

The Great Ship series - particularly the short story collection - by Robert Reed has a fair bit of this. The Culture series has a bit, and it's really interesting. The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (whatever that verse is called) has this in spades, but was a bit too boring for me.

I'll even admit I found the third book kind of floundering, but I still loved reading every word.

I loved all the tea (I don't even drink tea!), I loved all of the careful, precise wording when Breq is reaching out to her crew to see how they're feeling. I loved the silly little mystery that makes up much of the plot of book 2. I loved the Translators, so so much (perhaps Leckie should try her hand at horror). I love that I know almost no one's gender throughout the reading!

I normally hate when authors over-explain things (I take it as condescending), but not all of the repetitive I-used-to-be-a-ship, i-used-to-be-many, this-gun-shoots-1.11-meters, 8-sylabbled-lord-of-the-raadch, etc. I needed constant reminder that Ship was Ship, and who was an Ancillary, etc.

How can the whole thing be a hallucination if any of the events that happened in the south were real, like massive rivers becoming tiny streams.

As he grows into adolescence in Mongolia, a group called the Seven Heroes of the South searches for the boy, intent on bringing him back to China and to train him in martial arts. *Everything I’ve seen says that plot descriptions simply don’t do this book justice*, so pick it up as soon as you can and check out its majesty for yourself.

The big gripe I have towards a lot of science fiction is that it's too based on this sense of liberal materialism all around it. and by liberal I mean status quo. The thing I am trying to talk about is the ""magic"" of drifting through space or interacting with beings that think nothing like you is sucked out of a lot of contemporary science fiction. Everything always has to be scientific or has to have an explanation for it. The whole possibility of exploring different worlds through science fiction is filtered through this and all the unimaginable spiritual experiences are ripped apart because everything needs to be explained in it.

1800,"Book recommendations examining nonlinear existenceSorry I'm not savvy with scifi lingo so if I sound like an idiot that's why haha.

I watched Arrival in theaters when it came out, and recently watched Annihilation with my partner. My partner then had on The Effective Science Fiction of Arrival by Screened (found here https://youtu.be/hJZKq9tWiFA) where he discussed the nonlinear experience of the aliens and how it transferred to the main character and she was able to experience her life in a nonlinear way. 

Annihilation speaks on the aliens experiencing their existence in a nonlinear fashion more explicitly, but I didn't make the connection that that was what was happening in Arrival (I thought the main character was just flashing back in those memories to things that she had already experienced, and then reconnects with her partner after that trauma at the end, thus the story bringing them back together).

Which leads me to my question. I didn't recognize it in Arrival because I hadn't been exposed to that idea, and I'd love some scifi book recommendations where this nonlinear perception is used, and possibly even a prominent feature in the story line, as I'd like to have more exposure to it.

*Pssst...Netflix...shhh...Yepp, you, the streaming mogul...are you listening? Look no further, here is your next big thing!*

First, lemme tell you how PFH influences my life...

**It hurts my family life...** because, when I read his books, I stop properly looking after my family: I get home after work, sit down, tell everyone to leave me alone and go on reading. My wife sometime talks to me, but I perceive only distant noises, something that must not be too important.

**It hurts my professional life...** because I stay up in the night until 3am, and next day I obviously call in to my boss, that I take a day off.

**It hurts my social life..**.because when I go out with my friends to play a boardgame, I just grab my kindle unobtrusively, when it is not my turn, and read few pages....much to the dismay of my buddies. Quite frankly, getting the next PFH book is like getting prison time: I am not *allowed* to do anything else. And when I finish the book, then - and only then - I can go on probation and resume my regularly scheduled programme. It is that addictive.

Worst of all, **it hurts my reading hobby...** because I care a lot less about other books. Sure, I read an Alaistar Reynolds here or a Neil Asher book there, but I am just treading water until waiting for the good stuff. Don't come to me with the Three-Body Problem fellas, that is a massive disappointment and can't comprehend how that actually got that Hugo (prolly geopolitics), while PFH does not even get a nod. Bleh, wandered off a bit...

So, all the above feelings skyrocketed to a whole new level this spring, when I finished Salvation. Man, I just can't tell you how painful not to be able continue reading right away. Luckily, I just hit a stroke of good fortune, and received an advance copy of Salvation Lost (thanks!) in exchange for generating some noise about it. Now, if you haven't read the first book of the trilogy, you must know that you really should not read further. I will be spoiler-free of the 2nd book, but can't review this without spoiling the 1st one. Also, this being a detailed review, if you are clever, you may be able to work some details out. You have been warned.

Dude...I told you not to continue. Just get the first book, read through, get shocked and come back.

Still here? Cool.

Salvation Lost is very different from the first book. Salvation was a ""whodunit"" story, with elaborate world building and a slowly unraveling mystery, sprinkled with a tiny bit of paranoia. That book ends on a cliffhanger that explains the events before and at the same time outlines a very grim future, a future - as we already know - that changes humanity forever. On the other hand, this book is about escalation of the conflict, desperate actions (and counteractions) to achieve survival, and witnessing the disaster that is unfolding, all these unfolding at a breakneck speed. It is also a middle book of a trilogy, with all the baggage that means: it continues the story from the first book, but does not really conclude. Really, this is one big story split into three volumes.

Gone are the flashbacks of the first book, the time of worldbuilding is over, but we still have *present* and the *far-future* storylines. In the *present* we get to see the overwhelming catastrophe that humanity facing through the eyes of multiple characters. Very cleverly, these people are from different classes, so rotating between them gives us a glimpse of personal sacrifices they are going through - and, in general, the disaster that falls on humanity. The present-time pacing is very tight, and so is the timetable: the unfolding events are covering only few days, where high-risk-high-reward missions are only about to get us a few more. And when the Olyix start to utilize there KCells to aid them in their invasion, certain chapters gets a real horror vibe to them.

My favourite character this time is Ollie, a lowlife criminal unwittingly entangled into affairs no humans ever wants to be involved with. Ollie's motivation is very relatable, despite all his misgivings you will come to like him. He is a byproduct of the society he grew up in, he ended up with wrong people, but he is not an evil person. He gives us the viewpoint of lower classes, how everything about the invasion is just a rumor on the internet and how they are the first ones to be abandoned by the higher-ups. Their drug-induced conversation with his friend, while watching television broadcast of the invasion, is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read.

Next up is Gwendoline, who appeared in Salvation as a frightened little girl. This time she is an upper echelon middle-aged woman, doing important work in Connexion. Despite being family of Zangaris, she represents the hard-working executive who is just outside of the inner circle: Her eyes are the window we can use to peek into the life of rich, whose fortune will mean nothing in few weeks.

We get back Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik and - of course - Jessika, our friendly neigbourhood alien spy/diplomat. Out of all of them Alik gets the least spotlight, she is mostly off-screen to manhandle some Washington DC politicians. Yuri is still the no-nonsense security man, he is calling the shots and is making all the right (and hard) decisions, while Callum is still the resourceful creative troubleshooter he always was...both of them is having a considerable role in formulating a response during the invasion, and it is a joy to read their - usually action packed - chapters. Kandara is also getting a decent role, we get a better glimpse into her personality, because well...she understandably has trust issues.

Jessika becomes a major character who has to overcome human mistrust to get humanity very quickly where we need to be in order to ensure survival. It is a main theme, that we may not want to hear and accept what she tells us. She and her colleagues also has some neat technology brought with them, that will help us to survive, but let's stay spoiler free here. I was very impressed with how the different timelines are subtly connected: in one of the *present* chapter a certain virus is mentioned, that is coming back almost immediately in the *far-future* chapter, but not before. I found these small and subtle pieces fascinating, how they are connecting the different storylines, yet none spoils the another.

Speaking of *far-future*, if you read the publicly available [prologue](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/550926/salvation-lost-by-peter-f-hamilton/9780399178856), you will have a very good idea where those chapters take us. I have a bit less to say about these, they are very spoiler-prone, but we still have the same core characters, Dellian and Yirella. We get to experience how the ""Lure"" - that was hinted at in the first book - pans out. Now I'll be very careful here, but still, here's some teasing: in Salvation it was emphasized that in order to be safe, humans must be silent. Thus, we do not know anything which is beyond the knowledge of our characters. But rest assured, stuff happened in the galaxy in that 10.000 years, even if we do not know about them yet. We also get a very little teasing about some previously unseen aliens, who I expect to have a greater role in the final book.

We also have a new character in this timeline, almost from the start, though neither its allegiance, nor its origin will be apparent at first. It has a major - even ""deus exish"" - role in the final part of the book, which is a little bit unexpected, but I am 100% certain his presence and origin will be explained in the final installment. The way it was written also reminded me very much of Gore Burnelli from the Void trilogy.

One aspect I extremely like about this trilogy is the ""hard scifiness"" of it. In the Commonwealth series, especially from the Void trilogy onwards, humans travelled between stars - and later, between galaxies - with a relative ease. That part did not feel very ""hard"" to me. Here, however, distances are vast, and there is no way to cheat around them. There is an explanation how travel between galaxies (nearest is 2.5 million light years) is totally out of reach, and I actually &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; there is no escape from the Olyix. Our galaxy is a prison, where they are the top dogs, and there's no such thing as leaving for greener pastures. We either fight, hide...or die. No other options.

I also was amazed by the depiction of Olyix. It becomes very clear real quick, that Olyix are not stupid, and they are not stagnant, either. Yepp, they are in charge in the galaxy, but they are not sitting back and becoming complacent. Both in the *present* and in the *future* we witness that they are advancing. Mostly technological changes, yes, they may not evolve as a species, but some stuff the Neana know and tell us about them is out-of-date. We may outmaneuver them once, but the same trick will not work again. They are not waiting patiently for us to grow and defeat them. Humans must be really on top of their game. These touches make them even more menacing, more real: It is not coincidence they have been able to persecute their campaign for eons.

I am happy to inform everyone that the ending is great, it is intriguing and sets up questions that will leave you thinking until the final one arrives. I am double happy to tell you it will not consume you like the ending of the first book did: if you have heard, that ending of Salvation will render you an incoherent mess mumbling about ""how can I survive a whole year until next book""...you heard that right:) But the 1st and 2nd book together will leave you in a more relaxed state: you will still want more, but you will be able to go ahead with your life until 2020 October.

Back to the first line of my review: I never could imagine how a Commonwealth or Night's Dawn TV series would be doable (scope, characeters, locations, budgets). This however...this screams for television. Smaller cast of characters, basically everything happens at Earth, action, twists and dread. It has it all. Can't even comprehend how Amazon scooped up Three-Body Problem and not this one....er....sorry again.

Long story short: Salvation Lost is absolutely mind-blowing. Goodreads should introduce the 6th - and maybe 7th - stars and reserve it for PFH. This trilogy sticks with you: you will go out, watch the stars, and say ""*Hey, this* [METI Thingy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METI_(Messaging_Extraterrestrial_Intelligence)) *may not be such a good idea after all...perhaps we should just listen quitely for a good while and compare notes before shouting out loud into the unknown that we do not understand.""*",0

(If you're like me and have trouble remembering where you left off, [here's a handy link to last month's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/ckq83e/month_of_july_wrapup/))",0
1811,"Thoughts on The SparrowI saw this book recommended in this subreddit some time back on books about first contact but from a religious perspective. I found the premise quite interesting and started reading it as it was highly recommended and I saw that it won multiple awards for Sci Fi. Now having finished the book, my feelings about it are mixed. From a SciFi and a SETI first contact type story I thought it wasn't upto the mark. 

While the premise about a Jesuit mission is super interesting, I wasn't fully convinced on a few things like how quickly and accidentally they come across the first signal, the justification for the people chosen for the mission (seemed poor/not logical), and I felt the story went downhill once the aliens were introduced and we started reading from their POV as well. In this regard I found Rendezvous with Rama as the best first contact book iv read and it scored in all the above areas: the detection of the vessel and the response to it and it's timeline was very believable, as were the crew chosen for the mission and the entire sense of intrigue and mystery unfolded superbly layer by layer and held very well till the end. There was an interesting premise in The Sparrow about how first settlers can unintentionally alter the existing balance of power amongst natives but this was barely explored and was explained away in just a few paras. I felt there was a lot to build upon here.

However, if I leave aside the SciFi aspect and look at it more as a book about philosophy, theology, faith in God and his place in the universe, I think this book scores much better. Ofcourse there were major issues in this perspective as well, specifically with regards to the ending, which seemed to me that it went to a really dark place really fast just to prove a point but didn't seem logical. 

Overall, a good book but could have been a masterpiece IMO if some of these inconsistencies were worked out.

Anyone agree with this view or did I miss something? Let me know your thoughts as well as other books that you would recommend about first contact.",0
1812,"The Hercules Text revised edition?I picked this one up because someone recommended it in my ""intersection of religion and first contact"" request thread. But I ended up with a re-issue version from 2015 which, according to the forward, he reworked a pretty good bit, in particular to make it less ""Cold War"" in mentality.

Anyone know if I want to read this version or look for the original? Or want to confirm that it won't make a big difference?",0
1813,"Space Opera September Readathon - Hosted by SFF180Just wanted to give a heads up there is a readathon starting tomorrow 9/1/19 hosted by a pretty cool booktuber and reviewer named Thomas of SFF180.  He explains it all in a fun and adorable video (link below).

If you don't have time to do the readathon, you can check out his reviews on scifi and fantasy reads, which I've found to be refreshing and informative and I've been following SFF180 for many years now.

1816,"The shape of the world in Ted Chiang's ' The Tower of Babylon'I just read  Ted Chiang's short story 'The Tower of Babylon', and I am still confused what the shape of the world is supposed to be. The story mentions a cylinder but I am not sure how that works, and I've looked it up online, and there are people saying it is actually a three dimensional torus, or a set of four dimensional concentric spheres.",0

1818,"Is it possible that Vernor Vinge has dementia? (serious question)Vernor Vinge, although never a prolific author, published his last novel in 2011. This novel was generally considered inferior to his previous work. His last good novel (Rainbows End) was published in 2006. Interestingly (to me) the novel opens with a POV of a character who has just been cured of Alzheimer's disease.

Via Google, I can't find any reference to his having appeared in public since 2014. That reference was an announcement that an organization was going to give him some sort of award, but there was no information about what he may have done or said at the ceremony (or evidence that he even appeared). The last confirmed appearance (that I can find) was in 2012, the year after he published Children of the Sky.

Authors have been known to continue to work in the early stages of dementia, notably Agatha Christie (and I guess Terry Pratchett) but analysis of these works by linguists apparently reveals a degree of cognitive decline. BTW Terry Pratchett is also prominently mentioned in Rainbows End although I don't think that is relevant to my thesis.

I don't want this to be true, but I have been wondering about it for a while. I would like to think we can look forward to one or more new good novels (or shorter works) from him, but it's been a long time now.

EDIT apparently not.",0
1819,"So I read Echoes of an Alien Sky by James P HoganI think the book is average, definetly not Hogan's best BUT it has, to me, the most plausible universe in that electricity runs the universe and not gravity. I haven't encountered that theory in most of scifi if I'm honest.",0

1821,"Questions about Hyperion that keep me up at night.So I read the first two Hyperion books which were, at times, interesting. I don't intend to read the other two any time soon so feel free to spoil them in answering these questions that continue to bug me. Most things might just be stuff I didn't pick up on or didn't understand.

1) Why did Moneta/Rachel transform into a Shrike-like creature in Kassad's story? And why is it never mentioned again?

2) If the Keats persona is intended to proceed Empathy then why would the Core create him in the first place?

3) What did the Shrike intend to do with baby Rachel?

4) How did Brawne kill the Shrike?

5) What was Gladstone's plan? Its mentioned that she has to pick between Chaos and Survival or Peace and Annihilation but is it ever actually explained why this was the case?

6) If the Core can create an army of cybrids, whom we know to be more or less human, then why the need force humans into the labyrinths? If the Core was going to wipe out their armies of cybrids with the big deathwand, wouldn't it make more sense just to insert them into the labyrinths and use their synaptic power instead of the humans?",0
1822,"Something Scary that Doesn't Give me an Existential CrisisI've read plenty sci-fi over the years and some of it has been pretty freaky. [insert _Blindsight_ reference here] But what I'm looking for is something that, while scary, doesn't make me depressed for days. I like Watts and I thought his story _The Things_ was one of the most disturbing takes on the nature of humanity that I've ever read. It actually made me horrified of my own species. But I'm not really in the mood to be that level of nihilistically terrified right now. I just want to have some fun.

What I want is something that is thrilling and spooky while still being _enjoyable_. Basically like _Alien_. A fun and thrilling horror story that doesn't leave me questioning my existence at the end

A decent example would be the _Revelation Space_ series. Sure, it is pretty bleak and depressing but overall I'd say it kept the sense of enjoyment at a high level with all the fantastical technology and sweeping scale of the plot. (note: the story doesn't have to be very high tech or large scale at all. I simply used this series as an example of scary but enjoyable)

PS: Greg Bear is definitely out as well because HOLY SHIT blood music was all kinds of fucked up.",0
1823,"[potential spoilers ahead] Books similar to Seveneves?Hey guys! I'm looking for books that install that existential dread like Seveneves does. Post apocalypse, space opera, military scifi, you name it. I just want something that makes me think ""oh no, this is really fucked.""",0
1824,"Looking for some more deep, dark tales.A few months ago I posted about looking for some unhappy books:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/bfxfb1/looking\_for\_some\_really\_unhappy\_science\_fiction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/bfxfb1/looking_for_some_really_unhappy_science_fiction/)

Here are my thoughts on the ones I've read:

* The Sparrow - 4/5 - Ending was obvious, the cast were really dumb and perfectly whimsical but I liked the story overall.
* The Gap Series - Book 1 3/5, Book 2 4.5/5, Book 3 4/5 - Going pretty good but the 3rd book had a lot of unnecessary perspectives.
* Kaleidoscope Century - 3/5 - I can see where the depressing part may be but I didn't really enjoy it that much.
* The Library at Mount Char - 4/5 - Funny and sad and enjoyable.
* The Road - 3/5 - I didn't enjoy the writing style. I found it distracting.
* I have no mouth etcetc - 4/5
* Planetfall - 5/5 - It was incredible reading from the perspective of someone with a mental illness. I loved this one.
* The Three Body Problem - Book 1 3.5/5, Book 2 4/5, Book 3 4.5/5 - The first one was quite boring compared to the other 2.
* Flowers for Algernon - 4/5 - Read it in a day.
* Parable of the Sower - 5/5 - couldn't sit around not reading it when I had time.

Here are the ones I own but haven't read yet:

* Book 4 and 5 of the Gap Series.
* Blindsight and Starfish by Peter Watts.
* Xenogenesis Series by Octavia Butler.
* Seveneves by Neal Stephenson.
* Consider Phelbas by Ian Banks.
* The Water Knife by Paolo Bacigalupi.
* The Gone World by Tim Sweterlisch.
* Altered Carbon by Richard K Morgan.
* Revealation Space
* Titan by Steven Baxter

Here's my Goodreads read shelf. I'm currently reading Random Acts of Senseless Violence. 

Along with these maybe are there some other books that I might enjoy? I'm interested in stuff set in space, but I also like dystopian, a diverse cast is good but really not important if the story is good.",0
1825,"Fun feminist sci-fi/pulpTitle about says it all. I often see pulpy and/or golden age books described as ""fun"", but it's less fun and more slog to read a book that is covertly or overtly disdainful of your entire gender (or race, etc). Most days, I just want to read some shallow, fast-paced, escapist FUN, but usually when I check out recommendations for same, they make me feel worse rather than better. I can hold my nose and get something out of it, but that kinda defeats the whole purpose. I'm interested both in dark, hardboiled pulpy books and optimistic golden agey books here; whether it's grim or not, the important thing is that it's fun.

Here are a few things that fit what I'm looking for to some extent:

-Vorkosigan saga. Plenty feminist, but not quite shallow enough. It's a fantastic, fun series but it's very thoughtful, real, and constantly transcends the space opera box one expects it to stay in. This gets some points in the golden age category for being optimistic and Trekky.

-Takeshi Kovacs and other books by Richard K. Morgan. This might be the closest example I've found of what I'm after. It's fast-paced, violent, borderline pornographic, but mostly doesn't shit on women. Lefty pulp, almost. But women still get relegated to the sidelines, get bizarrely hot for protag's dick at weird moments, are sexually tortured, etc.

-Star Trek: TNG. Okay, so, Troi makes me scream internally, but I was raised on this show so it's easy to look past. TNG evokes the optimistic golden age feels for me and usually leaves me feeling better than I did. But sweet christ does it have its problems. Also it's a TV show.

-Comics: Transmetropolitan, Saga, Bitch Planet.

-Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. I'm in the middle of this and it's... okay. He doesn't hate women, and it's very golden agey and violent, but it is still about manly men with women as satellite characters.

-First 3 Praxis books by Walter Jon Williams. Literally has a borderline-psychopath female viewpoint character who gets back at men who wronged her. Awww yeah. The Accidental War lost me however with a pretty damn offensive portrayal of a trans woman.

-MURDERBOT. MURDERBOT MURDERBOT MURDERBOT.

What I'm NOT looking for:

-Becky Chambers's Wayfarers. Okay, it's optimistic and has simple plotlines, but it's more cozy than fun. Also, I really only thought A Closed and Common Orbit was worth my time of the three.

Can anyone out there relate? Any recommendations? Where are all the books by women with ultraviolence and sex and tidy endings?

Amazon originally made me think it was a 4 book series. I did some more digging and now it seems like it is up to 7 or more? I just finished book 2. While I am enjoying it I am not sure I want to commit to 7 books without end. Does it evolve into a stories-in-the-universe like the Posleen books or is there an actual end goal here? 

The core Posleen books were great but then it kinda wandered off into other territory that I didn't care about. Does this do the same?",0
