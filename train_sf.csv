[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven)

&gt; Set in the days of civilization's collapse, Station Eleven tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.

&gt; One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.

8,,printSF,"(There are some spoilers about Star Maker in this text, but I'm unsure whether you can even call them spoilers since the book is about an idea about consciousness rather than a traditional conflict driven novel, and as such is more a philosophy told through a story. If you plan to read it and prefer not to know, I recommend you stop reading here.) 

Someone recommended ""Star Maker"" by Olaf Stapledon to me a few years back. I'm an avid consumer of sci-fi, although the past ten years I've consumed it more in movie/series formats than books. Since Arthur C Clarke, who was one of my favorite authors as a kid who escaped a lot into books, called it ""probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written"" and several other authors considered it to be very influential in their work (and CS Lewis called the end ""devil worship""), I decided to give it a go. 

I have to admit that it wasn't an easy read if you're used to the traditional western way of storytelling with conflict as a major driver of the plot. It really was quite imaginative, so much so that when I reached about 70% where he wrote about stars communicating with each other, I put it down. I had reached the limits of my suspension of disbelief for that time. Still, I couldn't get it out of my head, and I eventually returned to it and finished it. 

It took a couple years for me to digest it, but in hindsight I can see that It changed my mindset in a very profound way. It paved the way for an existential crisis that was turbulent, sometimes very unpleasant, but in the end very constructive.

17,,printSF,"I'm not seeing a dedicated review thread for this book. Apologies if I missed it. Don't read this post if you don't want spoilers.

I always think of the release of a new Gibson book as a big deal.

I re-read The Peripheral in anticipation / preparation for this one -- Agency is definitely its sequel (perhaps that's not 100% the semantically-correct term, given that the near-present half of the story takes place earlier than the near-present portion of The Peripheral -- but the far-future portion is sequential to the previous book's, and both segments feature characters introduced there). It's also (it seems to me) very clearly the second book in one of his trilogies. (Hopefully not his last, but SF writers tend not to have that long a shelf life).

The Peripheral has a lot of tics and flavors I've come to savor from Billy G: low-rent characters facing hi-tech challenges, a certain amount of fascination with the machinery of fame, substance abuse problems, and sweet, fragmented prose.

Agency doesn't really have those things, unless you want to count gig-economy knowledge workers as ""low-rent"", and the entirety of Silicon Valley society as caught up in a culture of fame implementation. What I miss though is the tightness of prose in this one -- I am thinking that the last-minute rewrite due to a Hillary-less White House, and the unfortunate death of his long-time editor, have resulted in a book that doesn't really feel finished. (And I kind of miss Wilf Netherton's drinking problem -- I'm glad he's happier, but he's a bit less interesting as a dad).

I'm going to skip over Eunice, who's very much the most interesting character in the book, and a spiritual grand-daughter to Mike in Heinlein's Moon Is A Harsh Mistress. Her antics are pretty cool and amount to a kind of sufficiently-advanced-technology-indistinguishable...

Kirkus Reviews rags on the book pretty badly, calling it ""possibly tired"" and I have to agree that the middle half of the story is basically a chase that doesn't expose us to very much that's cutting-edge interesting. It mostly seemed like stalling, while certain other threads in the book could catch up.

I thought of it as a kind of shell game, or a juggling act. After Eunice disappears in Chapter 35 -- Gibson employing his trademark one scene per chapter, a tic I've always enjoyed -- (and  I couldn't ever see her as permanently deleted, so the stakes never felt high to me -- similarly for the impending nuclear war), Verity Jones is chased by bad guys, switches vehicles, hides somewhere, gets found out. Wash-rinse-repeat until we're about 90% through the book.  Upstream, in 2136 London, Lowbeer dispatches threats to her person that were never too credible.

Unlike Flynn, Peripheral's protagonist, Jones never really \*does\* anything. She follows instructions from people who, like her, also have no real idea why they are doing the things they are doing. Who lack agency. Which I assume is no accident, and maybe after I've digested it further I'll get the joke.

I don't mean to be unremittingly negative. William Gibson always gives me something to think about. In this case, I think it's obvious that the third book of the trilogy will address the fact that no one in the Lowbeer / Netherton future knows how the connections to the ""stubs"" are made, and that they themselves are probably a ""big stub"" (as Connor jokes). So that should be fun. And so should the existence of a self-aware AI who will no doubt be multi-homed in different continua.

19,,printSF,"About 3 years ago I got introduced to science fiction when a friend handed me Dark Matter (Crouch) and told me in no uncertain terms that I must read it. In the decade prior to this I had read exactly 1 book, the DaVinci Code, and never even knew I had friends that *could* read, let alone were getting excited enough about it to aggressively share book recommendations.


I was in my early 30s at the time, still holding onto my 20s by spending my free time and money between bars and video games, and had absolutely zero interest in sitting down to read books. Which is to say that when this friend thrust a book into my hands and told me to read it, my decision to read it had nothing to do with the book itself. I thought he must need to tell me something, or maybe there's something bigger at play here. Or he's on drugs and hopefully he's left me some between the pages. The notion that he recommended a book to me because he had read it, enjoyed it, and thought that I too would enjoy it never crossed my mind.


So I started reading it right away and finished it that same day. This was quite the impressive feat at the time for me. Not so much that I read an entire book in one day, but rather the fact that a book was able to keep my attention for longer than 20 minutes. I called my friend and interrogated him as to why he wanted me to read it, and it turns out he just really liked the book and knew me well enough to know I'd like it too. Mother. Fucker.


And I did enjoy it. So much that I googled ""books to read if you like Dark Matter"" and immediately ordered the Red Rising trilogy the search results pointed me towards. 2 days later they arrive and I blow through the trilogy in a week. Learning that science fiction was more than my parent's Stargate SG-1 was a major discovery. Being able and eager to prioritize reading over television and video games was a revelation.


Looking back I'm a bit embarrassed at how amazed I was at Dark Matter and Red Rising. They're both good enough books, for sure, but they're also very simple and barely scratch the surface of what science fiction is able to accomplish. Dark Matter in particular left me feeling quite silly after I re-read it a few months ago. It's a fun book, no doubt, but it is the quintessential ""basic bitch"" of big idea scifi. It is also, as it turns out, the perfect amount of basic bitch fun to grab a disaffected non-reader by the balls and have them thank you for it.


After Red Rising I found r/printSF, sorted by all-time best, and quickly had a list of books that kept popping up in the recommendations threads. Hyperion, Blindsight, Neuromancer, Children of Time, the Culture, the Quantum Thief, Revelation Space, and so on. Real, hardcore science fiction. Not Dark Matter. 


I launched straight into Hyperion and was mesmerized throughout all 4 books. You've all read it, you all know what I'm talking about, and those of you that say the two Endymion books are garbage: no, you're garbage!


Then came news that Obama was reading a science fiction book called The Three-Body Problem, apparently the greatest work of Chinese science fiction and newly translated into English. Immediately following Hyperion I dove into TBP and the series ended up defining what it is I love about science fiction in the same way that the Expanse series defines what it is I hate. 


Big ideas, drawn out to interesting places and exploring the philosophical and societal ramifications. I don't care if the prose isn't perfect or if the characters weren't expertly crafted. Bring me real science mixed with the purely theoretical, the more fringe the better, and shatter my mind with the philosophy that emerges if things end up being this particular flavor of *just right*. Save your hero journeys, spare me your space operas. I once was blind but now I see; Red Rising is pulp fiction and Blood Music is a masterpiece. Fight me.


Over the next 2 ½ years I read a few hundred books. I consider myself quite well read in the hard science fiction space, although I admit I've restricted myself primarily to science fiction's brand name authors and their most popular works (I'll read you soon, Ophiuchi Hotline, I promise).


I say all of this because context is important, and I want you to know exactly what kind of reader I am so that when I tell you that Anathem is the greatest book of all time you'll know that it comes from someone that knows what they're talking about. Or doesn't. Maybe you think the Expanse is top shelf scifi and that Robert Wilson's 'Spin' is highfalutin crap. Maybe you read Roadside Picnic and thought it wasn't that big of a deal, and maybe you think A Fire Upon the Deep could have spent more time with the dogs.


What I'm trying to say is that every once in a while you come across a book that alters the way you view everything that came before and all that will come after. Hyperion and TBP are two such examples for me. Anathem is the latest, the first in a year or two, and has rocked my foundation as a reader more so than maybe even Dark Matter did when I was a novice. I foresee this being the stick with which all else is measured for a very, very long time.


To sum it all up, I feel both privileged to have had the opportunity to experience Anathem and also deeply saddened by the fact I am now likely cursed never to witness another reach such heights.  If you've read Stephenson then you know what it is to be hurt by Stephenson. Anathem makes up for all his prior sins, not wasting a single one of its 932 pages and sticks the landing to perfection.

31,,printSF,"Hi,

I haven't read anything by CJ Cherryh before. I am wanting to get into the Alliance-Union universe.

I see there are a few different series in this universe. Where would be a good place to start?

I see Amazon has an omnibus, The Faded Sun Trilogy, containing Kesrith, Shon'jir, and Kutath. It looks like those might be the first published from this universe???

I also hear good things about Cyteen and Down Below Station. I would like to read Down Below Station and I see it's the first of its series in the universe.

Not sure my questions are clear from up above, but I hope they are.

Can I read Down Below Station before anything else and continue with that series of the universe? Should I start with another series first to better understand what is going on? Can any of the series in the universe be read in any order?

Any info on this series would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

33,,printSF,"I just finished Tchaikovsky's Children of Time and I was wondering if anyone wanted to discuss it. This was a book I was very excited to read. The premise sounded exactly up my alley - generational ship, alien planet, first contact. Awesome, sign me up because I live for that shit.

Unfortunately, after finishing the book, I can't help but feel disappointed for a variety of reasons. Before I explain why, I'll mention what I *did* like about it. That would be, probably unsurprisingly, the Spider culture. Tchaikovsky did some incredible worldbuilding here, using biological and cultural evolution and extrapolating it to a species that's both familiar and extremely alien. It was fascinating to see the Spider culture evolve on a different timescale, and their battle to survive and thrive felt pretty epic at times. They really did feel like the main protagonists of the story.

Now there's my biggest problem with the book, and that's the human protagonists. They take up a good 50% of the book and honestly, they are *boring as shit*. Like I honestly can't even pick a single individual out because of how much personality they lacked. Mason, Lain, Karst, Guyen...who is who? Who knows? They just randomly did things to move the plot along. No development whatsoever, and the interactions between them were boring and wooden.

Another issue I had was the weird pacing in the human section. We just kind of jumped from one event to the next without a lot of build-up or tension. I get that a lot of time passed between these events but I never felt like the author did a very good job of actually portraying this passage. Mason just wakes up one day and all of a sudden there are a bunch of cultists running around and Lain is some kind of Xena warrior woman. It's just done in a really flat and deadpan manner that robs these seemingly big events and incidences of their impact. The dialogue and conversation between the characters, as I mentioned, is really wooden and perfunctory. Maybe this was done on purpose, as ultimately they have been suspended in time for like a couple thousand years, but it doesn't make it any more fun to read.

I also thought that the potentially epic, cinematic premise was wasted because of the lack of visual storytelling. I never got a full mind's eye image of the environment they were in. A lot of authors can paint vivid pictures in your head, especially in sci fi, that really immerses you and makes you feel the vastness of space and the beauty and majesty of celestial bodies. CoT was curiously absent of any kind of sense of wonder from this standpoint. The planet is *green*, the spiders are *monstrous*, the Gilgamesh is *old* and that's the only description we ever get of them essentially. Really a missed opportunity to create something beautiful here, given the canvas Tcahikovsky was working with.

So yeah all in all, a bit of a disappointment for me. I did like the last quarter or so quite a bit, and the Spider world stuff kept me going but overall it was weak.

40,,printSF,"OK, so I will preface this with saying that overall, I enjoyed the novel quite a bit. It's the followup to his other novel *Dark Matter* in style, if not in content. It is fun, thrilling, occasionally thought-provoking. I have always been interested in things like the hard problem of consciousness, and the intersection between thought, memory, and reality. I have a few questions though:

1) Is there any actual explanation given for why people using Helena's process are actually able to go back and change time, not only for themselves but everyone else? I understand being able to experience memories non-linearly, like in *Slaughterhouse Five* or *Arrival* but the only explanation given here is some hand-wavey stuff like 'well, its quantum mechanics!'. Which, honestly, is OK! It's OK to break the laws of physics and causality for the sake of the story, I'm just wondering if there's something deeper to it

2) Why is Barry Sutton able to go back to a 'dead memory'? It seems that there is an established rule that you can't go back to memories that existed in a timeline that no longer exists. However, Slade tells him there's a way.. and it turns out, the way to do it is just 'try very hard'. What??

It&amp;#39;s the followup to his other novel &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt; in style, if not in content. It is fun, thrilling, occasionally thought-provoking. I have always been interested in things like the hard problem of consciousness, and the intersection between thought, memory, and reality. I have a few questions though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Is there any actual explanation given for why people using Helena&amp;#39;s process are actually able to go back and change time, not only for themselves but everyone else? I understand being able to experience memories non-linearly, like in &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse Five&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; but the only explanation given here is some hand-wavey stuff like &amp;#39;well, its quantum mechanics!&amp;#39;. Which, honestly, is OK! It&amp;#39;s OK to break the laws of physics and causality for the sake of the story, I&amp;#39;m just wondering if there&amp;#39;s something deeper to it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Why is Barry Sutton able to go back to a &amp;#39;dead memory&amp;#39;? It seems that there is an established rule that you can&amp;#39;t go back to memories that existed in a timeline that no longer exists. However, Slade tells him there&amp;#39;s a way.. and it turns out, the way to do it is just &amp;#39;try very hard&amp;#39;. What??&lt;/p&gt;

2. The main characters are from (or just based?) out of Venus, which is a vague stand-in for Britain relative to real-life pirates, while Earth is the vague stand-in for Spain (and the antagonist).
3. One of the main character's favorite weapon is a laser backpack, which the other characters consider too difficult to use well (but of course this character is an ace with the thing).

91,,printSF,"Spoilers ahead, obviously.

I quite liked it. Definitely my favorite thing he's written since Neuromancer (for reference, I've read the whole Sprawl trilogy, Virtual Light, Idoru, and Pattern Recognition). 

The near-future bits really nailed it for me. I don't actually necessarily think the future will be as grim as he depicts, but it was nonetheless a very plausible and fleshed-out description of a future that I could imagine potentially coming true. 

I actually found myself less invested in the far-future timeline. I didn't really connect much with Netherton as a character, though Ainsley Lowbeer was always fun to have on the page. The jackpot was one of the scarier fictional apocalypses I've ever seen--the lack of melodrama made it feel all the more plausible. Somehow, imagining the slow, grinding attrition of 80% of the human race from a neverending train of resource wars, famines, superbugs, climate change-related disasters, etc... was much more horrific than the standard science-fictional nuclear war or dimensional rift or what have you. I liked (as a narrative device, not as an IRL concept) the idea of a world populated entirely by the descendants of 21st-century kleptocrats, but I felt like having them explicitly revert to old-timey systems of government was a bit too on-the-nose; Gibson handled it tastefully enough, but I think he could have just left that out and justified any weirdness as ""they're kleptocrats, they're just like that."" 

I'm of two minds about the structure. On one hand, the very closely-entangled narratives and very short chapters prevented that kind of ""aww *man*, I was just getting invested in this character, why do I have to read about someone else?"" effect that I feel creates a continuous background radiation of dissapointment for me when I usually read novels with the two PoV entwined-narratives-that-come-together-about-halfway-through format. On the other hand, sometimes the chapters felt a little *too* short; I think maybe if the average chapter had been one-and-a-half to two times as long as they were, it would have been a good sweet spot for me.

Overall I found the plotting tight and enjoyable, but the ending threw me a little bit. The resolution to the Aelita West murder mystery was so bland that I literally don't remember what it was, and I read the book *yesterday*. I don't even remember if they ever explained who the guy who murdered Aelita was, other than that he was in league w/ Daedra, Hamed al-Habib, and the Remembrancer guy. Gibson is talented enough of a writer that I have to imagine that was intentional, for whatever reason, but it sort of robbed the climax of some of its impact. I also felt like the ending, with Flynne and all her friends shacking up with random other named characters, was frankly bizarre. I understand wanting to inject a bit of romance into the optimistic ending to an overall pretty grim book to really hammer home that things are going to be OK, but it was kind of cheesy.

&lt;p&gt;Overall I found the plotting tight and enjoyable, but the ending threw me a little bit. The resolution to the Aelita West murder mystery was so bland that I literally don&amp;#39;t remember what it was, and I read the book &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t even remember if they ever explained who the guy who murdered Aelita was, other than that he was in league w/ Daedra, Hamed al-Habib, and the Remembrancer guy. Gibson is talented enough of a writer that I have to imagine that was intentional, for whatever reason, but it sort of robbed the climax of some of its impact. I also felt like the ending, with Flynne and all her friends shacking up with random other named characters, was frankly bizarre. I understand wanting to inject a bit of romance into the optimistic ending to an overall pretty grim book to really hammer home that things are going to be OK, but it was kind of cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear everyone else&amp;#39;s thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;

92,,printSF,"Hi everyone

I enjoy SF books a lot. However, I noticed that sometimes I'd get annoyed if the storytelling gets too non - linear, jumping between characters, places and times. I prefer if the story really focuses on the main character(s) and main story even if that means a limited viewpoint.

Here are some books that I enjoyed :

Culture series: two of my favourite books overall are player of games and excession but I have to admit that I couldn't get into use of weapons 

Expanse series: I really enjoyed the series until cibola burns (even if less linear than the other books in my list, it's just too good not to mention) 

Roadside picnic: possibly the most unique ""alien contact"" story I've ever read

Daemon &amp; freedom (D. Suarez): I have a weak spot for AI stories and this one is very entertaining to read

The long way to a Small angry planet (and the rest of the series): a lot of likeable characters, plus an AI character

Currently reading :old man's war which seems to fit nicely in the ""linear storytelling"" theme

while we may think their beliefs are goofy, if a group of people has heard stories or accounts of some river or shrine having healing properties, it makes 'sense' to travel to go get healed yourself. but there needs to be at least a legend or something to start that belief, even if it's based on an outright lie

i get that many of our characters have other reasons to end up on hyperion, but ignoring that, where did this belief in wish granting come from?


it seems rather simple for the author to add a few lines about 'someone, once, in the distant past, had some wish granted', even IF that is a lie propagated by the shrike church. but to my memory, there wasn't one. i can't imagine simmons would just.. forget. but if it's intentional, that is never commented on in narration or by the characters either.

So I've seen/read the Expanse (up until the Babylon book, I got frustrated with how it handled that) so that's out. But lately I've been looking for a good realpolitik or even just out there worldbuilding kinda book/series. Graphic novels, TV series, anime are all welcome as well, but I'm primarily interested in books/web fiction/written word (mods please don't hurt me). 

Ancient aliens/nonhuman aliens are very much welcome too.

***

What I've read in this vein that I can recall right now: 

* Expanse

* Ancillary books 1-2 (3 I got mired in, gave up)

* Hamilton's Commonwealth first 7 books I think (tried to get back into it but I've gotten pickier over the years and the pacing/character issues have become a dealbreaker)

* Takeshi Kovacs series (controversial opinion: I liked the show too, though I think the books are better)

* Tchaikovsky's Children books

* Stross' abortive Singularity Sky series (too bad it's never going to be finished, apart form the amount of over-the-top in handling space Nazis I liked it very much - I do love your works otherwise /u/cstross, thanks for being a consistent, high quality and imaginative writer)

* Crystal trilogy by Max Harms

* Quantum Thief books by Rajaniemi

* Reynolds' Revelations Space books (the stellar Prefect and its presentable sequel as well) and House of Suns

* Something totally else but on a whim I'm going to throw in Jemisin's Broken Earth books as well

* Becky Chambers' books

* Neal Asher's Polity books, the first ten or so

* (Honorable mention goes to Blindopraxia)

So, is there anything new that's come up in this vein lately (I haven't the time to follow the scene as close as I used to). Or on the other hand - what have I missed?

Barrayar has a decent amount of action, but a lot of it is just Cordelia getting used to her new world and developing relationships. Komarr is mostly about Miles meeting and falling in love with Kat, with a bit of a mystery and some action as well.

But then you have a Civil Campaign. There's one single brief chapter of action, and the rest is just characters milling about and doing their own thing. One character is developing butter out of big vomit, another is trying to get the girl he loves to marry him, another is trying to find her independence and decide what she wants to do. It's basically just a big, long drama.

I loved it and read the whole thing in a day. It's one of the best books I've ever read.

125,,printSF,"Between 1970-1986 the SFWA published 5 volumes of an anthology called The Science Fiction Hall of Fame.  The series included one work from 1895, one from 1909 and the remainder from 1934-1974.  I have a feeling they were going to keep going but the editor of the last volume Terry Carr passed and no one picked up the torch.

All of the works are short stories, novellas and novelettes.

I was curious to see what authors made it in and if any had multiple works.  Here's what I found...

--------

**3 works**

Poul Anderson, Fritz Leiber, Robert Silverberg, Theodore Sturgeon and Roger Zelazny

**2 works**

Isaac Asimov, James Blish, John W. Campbell, Jr., Arthur C. Clarke, Lester del Rey, Samuel R. Delany, Harlan Ellison, Robert A. Heinlein, C. M. Kornbluth, Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, Clifford D. Simak, Cordwainer Smith and Jack Vance 

**1 work**

Brian W. Aldiss, Gregory Benford and Gordon Eklund, Alfred Bester, Jerome Bixby, Anthony Boucher, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Algis Budrys, Theodore R. Cogswell, Gordon R. Dickson, E. M. Forster, Tom Godwin, Daniel Keyes, Damon Knight, Ursula K. Le Guin, Murray Leinster, Katherine MacLean, Richard Matheson, Anne McCaffrey, Vonda N.

E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum, H. G. Wells, Kate Wilhelm, Jack Williamson, Richard Wilson and Gene Wolfe

Are there any authors from the years covered that you are surprised you do not see?  A specific work by a missing author you would consider Hall of Fame worthy?

Of the authors that made it in are you surprised at the number of works?  Did they deserve more or less?

If there were a continuation of this series (post-1974) are there any authors you feel would definitely make it regardless of the representative work?  Any specific work by that author you would feel was Hall of Fame worthy?

I have a feeling they were going to keep going but the editor of the last volume Terry Carr passed and no one picked up the torch.&lt;/p&gt;

But the narrator they had grew on me, so I was sure it would be fine.

I had read that some people didn’t particularly like *Matter*, but I’d heard the same about *Consider Phlebas* and *Inversions* and I personally was a fan of those (if not so much as *Excession* and *Look to Windward*), so didn’t think much of it.

136,,printSF,"I am about 2/3rds of the way through Roger Zelazny's *Lord of Light,* my first Zelazny novel. I love the book so far and I intend to read some more Zelazny novels this year. This Immortal won the Hugo Award for Best Novel and it's short, so I figured that would be my next pick. When I looked at the Wikipedia page for This Immortal, I saw this section:

""Most, but not all of the cuts made for the serialized version were restored for the first paperback publication by Ace Books and the title was changed by the publisher to This Immortal. Zelazny stated in interviews that he preferred the original eponymous title. The abridged version was novel length at over 47,000 words; the paperback version was over 58,000 words after the cuts were restored. However, it was not until a book club version was published in the 1980s that Zelazny realized that some cuts had not been restored to the book version; thus, earlier publications of This Immortal were still not complete. The abridged magazine version also contains 10 paragraphs of text not in the book version, starting from ""And the long-dormant Radpol was stirring again, but I did not know that until several days later"" and ending with ""The days of Karaghiosis had passed.""

I love the book so far and I intend to read some more Zelazny novels this year. This Immortal won the Hugo Award for Best Novel and it&amp;#39;s short, so I figured that would be my next pick. When I looked at the Wikipedia page for This Immortal, I saw this section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most, but not all of the cuts made for the serialized version were restored for the first paperback publication by Ace Books and the title was changed by the publisher to This Immortal. Zelazny stated in interviews that he preferred the original eponymous title. The abridged version was novel length at over 47,000 words; the paperback version was over 58,000 words after the cuts were restored. However, it was not until a book club version was published in the 1980s that Zelazny realized that some cuts had not been restored to the book version; thus, earlier publications of This Immortal were still not complete. The abridged magazine version also contains 10 paragraphs of text not in the book version, starting from &amp;quot;And the long-dormant Radpol was stirring again, but I did not know that until several days later&amp;quot; and ending with &amp;quot;The days of Karaghiosis had passed.&amp;quot; Also, the &amp;quot;Synopsis of Part One&amp;quot; that appeared in the November 1965 issue of F&amp;amp;SF (immediately prior to Part Two) is written in the first person and contains material about Conrad&amp;#39;s character and backstory that is not in the main text of ...And Call Me Conrad nor the 1980s restored version of This Immortal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Another example would be stories which take place on another planet where the local beings have primitive technology, or stories on earth about our hominid ancestors. The distinctive quality of such fiction is that it looks to the past rather than the future, but the emphasis is still on science and technology in that context.

I'm curious. Is there a name for this subgenre of science fiction? Thanks for any ideas.

157,,printSF,"One of my recent favorite fantasy series is the [Licanius Trilogy by James Islington](https://www.goodreads.com/series/136308-the-licanius-trilogy), which starts with *The Shadow of What Was Lost* and has just been concluded with *The Light of All That Falls*. It's nice to have an epic fantasy series that only required three installments and was actually finished in less than a decade of real time. I'm not finished with the final book yet, but the first two are a solid mix of interesting characters, mystery-box reveals, and intricate magic systems. It also has one of my favorite tropes from epic fantasy: the ancient-yet-advanced civilization that has fallen into ruin, usually in mysterious circumstances that are important to the central story.

However, like any series, it's not without its flaws. The biggest is probably that the story is almost *too* intricate and complex, as shown by the need for a detailed plot and character summary at the beginning of the second and third books. The magic systems are interesting but not very well defined (though they aren't trying to be anything like a Sanderson-esque set of predictable rules, so maybe that is OK). Overall, though, I think the epic-ness is well earned and the central characters are intriguing enough to carry through all three novels without becoming boring or overstaying their welcome.

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly he was alone, alienated from his own race, hated by the Medlins, and an imposter on Earth. No matter what side he chose he&amp;#39;d be a traitor/  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet choose he must...or forever remain a man without a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely my type of sci-fi.  What&amp;#39;s your first for the year?&lt;/p&gt;

161,,printSF,"There's been a few award tracker spreadsheets floating around so I thought I'd share a master spreadsheet inspired by some of these, that I've been putting together for a while.

**Award wins and nominations tracked for:**

* Hugo
* Nebula
* Locus SF
* Campbell
* Arthur C. Clarke

**Tracking, Award and Author breakdowns**  
You can mark which books you've read. Award breakdown shows the novels that won and were nominated across each award.

The Summary tab will provide an overview of how many you've read across each award.

Author breakdown will show you the wins and nominations that each author has received, as well as how many you've read.

**Scoring**  
I added a scoring system that I think helps ""normalise"" rankings for older books that were published when there weren't many awards around. You can change the scoring system in the spreadsheet by just choosing ""Regular"" from the drop down at the top of the Score column. That will essentially just give you the percentage of awards the book won.

If you don't like the scoring system at all, you can always just sort by the number of awards won.

**Notes**  
You can read more about the scoring system and sources in the ""Notes"" tab.


Edit: The spreadsheet is something you can make a copy of and keep updated for as long as you like. The intention isn't that you have to rely on me making updates to it in the future. I just wanted to share for anyone else who is like me and likes to keep track of their own things in spreadsheets. I also enjoyed working out a bit of a scoring mechanism for these novels.

- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 
- The Stars My Destination (the themes were interesting even if the writing is just ok) 
- A Canticle for Leibovitz
- Dune (have read the first one only) 
- Ender’s Game 
- 1984
- Illum (have yet to read Olympos)
- Alastair Reynolds short stories (have yet to read any full-length novels by him)

In one of those threads, I mentioned that I'd seen [a 2017 Clarke Award blog post](https://medium.com/@arthurcclarkeaward/publishers-who-want-new-readers-must-challenge-their-genre-boundaries-3c170d8b32b2), which quoted some research that SF readers not reading many {current-year} titles is actually pretty common (my emphasis):

&gt; We were also fascinated to see that the majority of readers in our sample were not only reading 50+ books a year but also buying 50+ books a year. But here’s the rub — of those 50 books being read a year, **only an average of five of those titles were read in the actual year of their publication**. You can count on reviews, blogs, tweets and so much more, but they are a groundswell, not a spike. In an industry that focuses all the weight of its attention on publication day before moving on to the next release, this is something of a problem.

Given that 2019 has just ended, it seems like an ideal time to do a similar, but very informal, survey here, so let me ask: **how many SF books published in 2019 have you read?**  My guess - based on things like what people post in [the monthly wrap-up threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/eio4jj/month_of_december_wrapup_optional_2019_personal/) - is that the average for this sub would be similar to that reported in that Clarke Award blog post, but it'd be interesting to see if it's not.

To kick things off, here are my stats for last year:

* Overall I read 59 books, of which 46 were SF&amp;F.  (The rest all being non-fiction.)
* Of those, 9 were titles first published in 2019.  This was actually a big jump from previous years, due to me deliberately making more of an effort to keep to up-to-date with the latest in the field.  By comparison, I only read 4 titles published in 2018 that same year, although I did catch up with another 6 of them this year.
* Of those 9, all but one were library loans - the size of my TBR pile means that I don't feel much inclination to rush out to buy new titles, unless they're on sale.  (I've got over a dozen 2019 titles that I picked up when they were cheap on the UK Kindle store, but have yet to get round to reading.  Perhaps I'm a bad fan/reader for not supporting authors/publishers by buying books when they're new/full price?)

NB#1: the above numbers are via [some code I wrote](https://github.com/JohnSmithDev/GRAnalysis) to produce stats based on a CSV export from Goodreads, which is more effort than I'd reasonably expect anyone else to go to - posting just a rough guesstimate figure would be more than good enough.

NB#2: I'm only interested in the total number of 2019 books you've read, not a list of the actual titles you read.  (Feel free to link to a Goodreads Year-in-Review or Reading Challenge page, or similar list of what you've read though.)

In the event there's enough response and interest, I might collate the replies into a follow-up post, but for now I'm just interested in getting a feel for the vague lie of the land.

Thanks in advance for any responses...

The basic plot was that slug-like aliens come to Earth in the near future, under false friendly pretenses.  The slugs were more or less human-sized, and were present in, I think, 3 ""races"" - brown (most common, the soldiers I think), black, and grey.  Humans at the time used energy beam weapons that had no effect on the slugs because of the slugs' force field armour.  Eventually someone discovered that physical weapons were not deterred by the force fields; I particularly remember them adopting old-style (for their era) guns like we use today.  I don't recall much more.

I am not sure if I'm confusing the story with the V series, but I recall they were after something, either humans for slaves or water or both.

Since we all know the best way to search for new books is with a topical laundry list, I wondered if people might help, since that seems pretty popular around here.  

The book must have an early middle aged male protagonist, preferably with a sexy female sidekick that excels in either engineering, programming, or martial arts.  It must be space opera, but the weapons used within the space opera must be a mix of melee and ranged, with strategic concerns mostly revolving around the use of biological ordinance.  There can be no lasers present in the book, neither pistols nor cannons, though plasma weaponry is OK.  There must be triad of major villains - no more, no less - all of whom must have at least one POV chapter dedicated to making them sympathetic villains.  At least one of them must have a physical deformity, preferably a limp, and one must be mentally ill, but in a dramatic 'Hannibal Lecter' way, as real mental illness is too depressing.  The action must take place on no more than two planets, and there must be a plot twist approximately 80% of the way through the novel.  Light romance and illusive sex is mandatory.

243,,printSF,"I've just finished the trilogy and, while it was never more than lightweight froth with an obvious author-insert, it was fun enough for what it was. But I found the third book harder going than the other two, and ultimately the least satisfying.

Firstly, there were a couple of plot threads that I just didn't care about. Most notably everything on Poseidon. I found all those chapters to be a drag.

But, more to the point, they're a perfect example of one of the things I found off about the book as a whole - the plot just sort of meanders around a bit without really doing much. The whole plot is the resident Bob saying ""well, I'm not actually going to fight back"", until it goes ""well, I did fight back and won easily"". Which...okay.

I felt the same about Bob with Archimedes. Everything with the Deltans seemed to be just marking time until Archimedes died in order to give Bob the impetus to get on with his life.  The Brazilian replicant comes back for no reason and then is just squashed with a slap.

But my biggest complaint is that the resolutions to plots seemed to be unearned. I partly mentioned that with the Poseidon stuff. Bridget absolutely does not want to be digitised at all...until she suddenly does, off-camera. And then the court case is won, not by anything clever anybody did, but just because that's how it was. And Bridget is saved. Again, not by anything clever, but just by a Bob getting to the stasis pod first.

But I found the third book harder going than the other two, and ultimately the least satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there were a couple of plot threads that I just didn&amp;#39;t care about. Most notably everything on Poseidon. I found all those chapters to be a drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, more to the point, they&amp;#39;re a perfect example of one of the things I found off about the book as a whole - the plot just sort of meanders around a bit without really doing much. The whole plot is the resident Bob saying &amp;quot;well, I&amp;#39;m not actually going to fight back&amp;quot;, until it goes &amp;quot;well, I did fight back and won easily&amp;quot;. Which...okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the same about Bob with Archimedes. Everything with the Deltans seemed to be just marking time until Archimedes died in order to give Bob the impetus to get on with his life.  The Brazilian replicant comes back for no reason and then is just squashed with a slap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my biggest complaint is that the resolutions to plots seemed to be unearned. I partly mentioned that with the Poseidon stuff. Bridget absolutely does not want to be digitised at all...until she suddenly does, off-camera. And then the court case is won, not by anything clever anybody did, but just because that&amp;#39;s how it was. And Bridget is saved. Again, not by anything clever, but just by a Bob getting to the stasis pod first.

Hyperion Cantus: So I had heard a fair bit about this before coming to this subreddit but you guys convinced me to take the plunge. Well worth it, although I haven’t taken a look at the sequel yet.

Ancillary Justice: This was another high recommendation but for the life of me I couldn’t get into it. I did get to the end, but I found it pretty tricky to follow. I don’t know, maybe it needs a second chance?

Exhalation: This collection of short stories was a nice little break from larger adventures. Kind of a mixed bag, and sadly one of the longest of the stories was one of the most dull for me. But the story for which the collection is named was fairly excellently crafted. Lots of lovely ideas in here.

Children of Time: I was a little wary of getting into this because I imagined for some reason it would be hard to follow with different alien races and people and so on. But then it was a surprise hit. Presented something very much out there in a very factual realistic way. I know there’s a sequel, is it worth a look?

The Three-Body-Problem and The Dark Forest: I’m actually in the middle of the dark forest now and enjoying quite a bit. The main issues I had with these two are the characters. I slip in and out of who it is I’m reading about, plus none of them really interest me much. But on the flip side, the stories and ideas presented definitely make up for that.

I thought his *Shadow Ops* modern military fantasy series was excellent, and the prequel trilogy was solid. His *Armored Saint* fantasy series was a departure from his comfort zone, with a truly awesome premise. The books didn’t quite live up to the premise’s promise, but the first two were still decent, and I look forward to reading the third in the trilogy. And I have a lot of respect for Cole writing outside of his comfort zone for the sake of pushing himself as a writer. A lot of writers have their own “voice” that’s pretty consistent across books: a Brandon Sanderson or Robin Hobb or Neil Gaiman book sounds like it was written by Sanderson or Hobb or Gaiman, as a rule. This isn’t a bad thing, but I respect Cole for pushing himself to break out of that mold.\n\n*Sixteenth Watch* is both a return to form (in that it’s modern military) and a departure (in that it’s hard sci-fi rather than fantasy). The premise is that the US and China are both working to ensure they have access to Helium-3 on the Moon, and tensions between the two countries are rising. The US Navy has been muscling the US Coast Guard out of operations on the lunar border between American and Chinese territories. The protagonist is Coast Guard Captain Jane Oliver, nearing the end of her career. Her goal is to avoid a war, and as long as the Navy is dealing with border issues, every situation will be approached as a potential combat situation (because the Navy is made to fight wars, and when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail). The Coast Guard, while still one of the armed services and able to fight, is more of a law enforcement agency. The Coast Guard, in Oliver’s opinion (and the Coast Guard brass’s opinion) can manage the border without escalating things and triggering a war.\n\nSo that’s the premise. Oliver is put in charge of a PR mission to convince the politicians and the public that the Coast Guard can handle the job, and is working to assert the Coast Guard against heavy pushback from the Navy and Marines.\n\nNow I have no problem with wish fulfillment fantasy. It can be both fun and rewarding to sink into a story of fun and adventure, putting yourself in the place of an awesome protagonist doing awesome things. But in reading *Sixteenth Watch*, I kept thinking this is the most specific wish fulfillment that I’ve ever read: the wish that the Coast Guard would get the respect it deserves from the other armed services, particularly the Navy. I have nothing but respect for the Coast Guard (though I will admit I don’t think about them much), but it’s not the easiest premise to relate to.\n\nCole himself is a Coast Guard vet, and it shows. He brings an authenticity to modern military fantasy/sci-fi that is usually a delight to read. But here, it was something of a drag. Reading about a team of Coast Guard operators training to prove that they can do boarding operations better than the Marines? That’s great. Reading about arguments between Coast Guard and Navy admirals arguing over whose interpretation of titles 10 and 14 of the United States Code is correct? Less great. Did you know that according to the 1972 COLREGS (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea), for both international and inland navigation, the right-of-way is given to the starboard vessel? Well, after reading *Sixteenth Watch*, I do.\n\nSo this book is highly recommended if you have served in the Coast Guard, or as a gift for a loved one who is serving or has served in the Coast Guard. I know I’m making fun here, but only mildly. It was just hard to shake the bemusement I felt while reading and thinking, “this is *awfully specific* wish fulfillment.” The book is well-written, and the main character is very compelling to read. I’m hoping there is a sequel – the story itself doesn’t need one, but there’s a rather big loose thread that I really want to see tied up. Between that and the protagonist alone I want more.

261,,printSF,"I’m looking for books like Star Wars. But let me clarify what I mean by “like Star Wars” cause it doesn’t just mean space opera.

The step down from complexity to simplicity was probably devastating... but all that's long since over; people enjoy a slower pace of life and closer relationships now that they don't have to compete to survive.

Kim Stanley Robinson&amp;#39;s New York 2140 would also be a good example of what I&amp;#39;m looking for. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a step down from complexity to simplicity - I agree with the latter sections of Schismatrix that there&amp;#39;s a danger in viewing simplicity as inherently better or more moral. Stories of how we held onto the complex parts worth keeping... but there have to be dead husks thrown away, whether by choice or catastrophe. A world ended and a better one built in its place; maybe not improved in every way, but not a total loss. The things that make people good or interesting should remain after everything else floats off in a Deluge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind for you?&lt;/p&gt;

281,,printSF,"So here is a short “my year in books” for 2019, I’ve read a mix of scifi and fantasy this year. With a clear outlier with Stephen Hawking. If there is only time to read 1 book from this list I would recommend you to read House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds. There are so many concepts I truly loved, that this would be the best book I’ve read this year.

**7 / 10: Charles Stross: The Labyrinth Index (Laundry Files, #9)**  
I think Stross has worked himself into a corner in earlier books. It feels like a TV show that continued for a season too long. However, this is still a solid 7, but relative to the other laundry files maybe a 6.

**7 / 10: Claire North: The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August**  
I liked it. Well written characters and an interesting take on time travel.

**8 / 10: Martha Wells:  (The Murderbot Diaries, 2 - 4) Artificial Condition, Rogue Protocol, Exit Strategy**  
I’m going to group these together because they are quite short each. Finally some closure for murderbot. I think murderbot is one of the best defined android characters in any book I’ve read. Please read the whole series.

**10 / 10: Alastair Reynolds: House of Suns**  
Loved it, there are so many things going on. With a cool intertwined origin story and it plays out on such a massive scale (both time and space wise) that it’s just mind boggling. Did I say I loved it? 

**9 / 10: Daniel O'Malley: The Rook (The Checquy Files, #1), Stiletto (The Checquy Files, #2)**  
First book is AWESOME. Second book is also good, but just not on the awesome level the first one was. Please read these before becoming disappointed by the tv show. 

**7 / 10: Becky Chambers: (Wayfarers, 1 - 3) The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, A Closed and Common Orbit, Record of a Spaceborn Few**  
I’m conflicted on these. I usually read books that have some build up, action and, preferably, some closure. These books don’t really fit. And I only realized it after reading the whole series. The character and world building of these books is just stellar. Just don’t expect too much action in part 2 and 3. Also, they share the same universe and some characters, but you can read them in any order and nothing will be spoiled or lost.

**5 / 10: Steve McHugh: Crimes Against Magic (Hellequin Chronicles, #1)**  
I saw this on my goodreads list and actually forgot I read this. Looking back I do remember the story to some degree. Skip it.

**8 / 10: Stephen Hawking: Brief Answers to the Big Questions**  
Good book, learn some actual science by reading this.

**7 / 10: Iain M. Banks: Consider Phlebas**  
I liked the world building and the actual concepts itself were cool. The book itself was quite boring however.

**9 / 10: V.E. Schwab: (Villains, 1 &amp; 2 ) Vicious, Vengeful**  
Good memorable characters, excellent pace and interesting plot. Finished these together in 10 days. (While I usually take at least 2 weeks per book!)

**7 / 10: Terry Pratchett: Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch**  
I listened to this as an audiobook in the months after my second son was born. I think the combination of listening in short stints (20 minutes max) and being kind of sleep deprived made this book a bit hard to follow. I like the main characters, but the overall plot just didn’t really work for me.

**10 / 10: George R.R. Martin: Tuf Voyaging**

325,,printSF,"So I have been reading a good bit of sci fi lately and I'm currently at the end of several series and looking for more to read.  I'm really looking for some books with some good fleet battles in space.  Politics is great too.  Some strong characters.  But I want there to be some space fighting.  Space marines are fine.  But not only space marines.  But space warfare too.  Here is what I have read recently:

1. Swarm series by BV Larson.  I liked the fleet nature.  I liked how they had to build it up and use alien technology to make more ships/defenses.  I really liked all that.  The fleet battles especially later on the in the series was great too.  I didn't really get into the sequel series, but overall I really enjoyed this despite some flaws.
2. Skippy the magnificent, er I mean the Expedition series.  I'm current up to date in this one as well.  I have enjoyed it for the most part.  But one series with an asshole AI is enough for me.  I don't think I could handle another one!  I enjoyed the series, but I really wish it had actual fleet battles instead of all the sneaky traps.  I understand from a narrative perspective why its the way it is.  I'm excited for the next book because I think it should have more fleet battles than previous books.  I also want to wait for the audible so even though it comes out soon I enjoy the narrator too much to read it.  So really its going to be a couple months before I get to listen to the next book in this series.
3. Starship Mage/Red Falcon series.  Currently up to date on these.  The fleet battles the last couple books were great.  More of this type of thing.
4. The expanse.  Currently on book 3.  Not a lot of fleet battles so far.
5. Revelation space - I'm having a hard time getting into this.  Its a bit dry.  So far no space battles but I'm not very far into it.  Have tried to get into it several times without any luck.
6. Old Man's war - Read it. Enjoyed it.   Honestly can't remember much if any fleet battles.  I think it was  mostly marines/ground warfare.
7. BAttle cruiser series by BV larson.  A lot of space battles.  Really liked it.   More like this.
8. Collapsing empire series  by John Scalzi - really enjoyed the politics/writing.  Didn't have much space battles.

Some observations:

* No obvious correlation is seen between the final ranking and the popularity of either the authors or the books.
* Only weak relation is seen between the final ranking and the Goodreads Average Rating - I had to draw a trend line of the latter to see there really is a trend.
* ""Series Survivor"" theory is demostrated - the top two Avg Ratings in this list are the the latest books in a series with the biggest numbers (#8 and #5 in their respective series).
   * ""Readers tend to rate later books in series higher because the ones who rate them low have dropped them already.""

Edit: forgot to mention one point:

* Winners #2 through #5 got much more votes than ratings - I mean really MUCH MORE on the same website. Who are so many of those who don't bother to rate a book but go out of their way to vote?

&amp;#x200B;

BTW:

There have been some worries that books which were published later in the year come with some disadvantages in this voting because they have less time to get known and read. But another diagram of Votes VS Published seems to be falsifying this hypothesis. There's no such correlation; if any, there's a reverse trend (earlier books have more time to get forgotten?):

A big element within TBP is how the Trisolaran's do not have an internal dialogue, thoughts and speech are one and the same (i.e. they have no concept of privacy). This gives humans a distinct if slightly fallible advantage in that they can defy the omniscient sophons by simply concealing their inner motives, the thinking behind the Wallfacer strategy that can only be thwarted by the traitorous human Wallbreakers.

At one crucial point of the trilogy the tragic Yun Tianming, reconstituted from a cryogenically frozen brain by the Trisolarans, is allowed to communicate directly with Cheng Xin so ingeniously shares information that could save humanity by concealing vital details as metaphors in three fairy tales (claiming these were a shared memory from their childhood).

Yun Tianming is able to tell stories to outsiders that conceal a critique of his captors that if he was more explicit would lead to certain death.

349,,printSF,"I know there's a controversy about the author due to his friendly stance on Chinese dictatorship. Anyway, the Three Body Problem series and The Wandering Earth collection belong to the best of contemporary Science Fiction I've read so I was curious about 'Ball Lightning'.

'Ball Lightning' is a stand alone novel which (as the author explains in the afterword) can be seen as somewhat of a prequel to the aforementioned trilogy. It is about a Chinese scientist driven to understand the national phenomenon of ball lightning, which traumatically incinerated his parents on his fourteenth birthday. On his quest he crosses the paths of many scientists who failed with 'ball lightning', the military, ex-soviet scientists and makes breakthrough discoveries. Eventually ball lightning is weaponized.

China in this novel is in a war. It's not declared with whom but it is likely the USA due to some remarks about the most powerful navy in the world. All science in this case serves the war machinery and a female major is playing an important role here in using ball lightning to turn the tide on the battlefield. Ball lightning is described as 'macro electrons' and later the 'macro nuclei' are found and used to create a macro atom bomb, so powerful it sends large parts of China back into the agricultural age  due to eating computer chips in a large area.

I found certain remarks of the outstanding physicist character Ding Yi mindbending: With the macro world a brain could have to size of the solar system. Also there's a twist when technology moves to quantum mechanics, which makes the novel relevant today and explains it to non-scientists like me.

So, at the end of the book, I think that the match was a draw, right? *Theseus* could send back data, it destroyed Rorschach - but the scramblers also got their victory, they figured out humans to the last nerves, they learnt how humans behaved. So the two parties - the Captain and the scramblers - were equal at first glance. 


But here is the thing: the Captain achived a draw against all odds. It was separated from the rest of mankind, fought without its quantum computing facilities (Sarasti mentions them being shut down due to the magnetic field), it barely had any hardware, it had lower tech, managed to feed the scramblers false data (the two that made back to Rorschach in pieces did not deliver any news about what they were up against) and commanded a crew that was practically useless against the aliens as it turned out. It also kept its antimatter reserves secret most likely (Rorschach would  not attack it if it knew I think) , made everyone, most likely the scramblers too, believe that Sarasti was running the mission. And in the end, it even managed to get Siri home, to let him escape from a system where the aliens's hardware outnumbered them by many magnitudes of mass and advancement.

&gt; Ambassador Mahit Dzmare arrives in the center of the multi-system Teixcalaanli Empire only to discover that her predecessor, the previous ambassador from their small but fiercely independent mining Station, has died. But no one will admit that his death wasn't an accident—or that Mahit might be next to die, during a time of political instability in the highest echelons of the imperial court.

&gt; Now, Mahit must discover who is behind the murder, rescue herself, and save her Station from Teixcalaan's unceasing expansion—all while navigating an alien culture that is all too seductive, engaging in intrigues of her own, and hiding a deadly technological secret—one that might spell the end of her Station and her way of life—or rescue it from annihilation.

* It was a time travel story
* The hero had traveled back to the Cretaceous, though we can't remember why
* Somehow he ran into and saved a pair of small, charming children
* He constantly called the little girl ""pumpkin"" (that's the joke - calling one another ""pumpkin"" in otherwise dead-serious or unexpected situations and making each other crack up)
* He rode around in a mechanical Triceratops (it had a name), and at one point let the little boy drive it
* We think it ended with some kind of time travel plot twist involving the little girl becoming his wife, or similar (yikes)

&lt;p&gt;First time I read the book I just assumed it was one gigantic very alien von neumann/berserker machine (since its never clear if its mission is to destroy other intelligences or just reproduce as a sort of space dandelion) but now it looks more like a space portuguese man o&amp;#39; war combined with the &amp;quot;chicken and egg&amp;quot; problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what came first? some kind of probe full of frozen scramblers that began building rorschach out of the debris around big ben once they stumbled upon it? or a very tiny rorschach launched from another planet (or another older rorschach) thousands or millions of years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are scramblers really an alien lifeform from another planet or just an engineered lifeform created by said aliens to build and maintain the rorschach &amp;quot;colonies&amp;quot;? I mean unless we figure FTL our interstellar missions might be like this, with earth-scramblers terraforming an exoplanet in some distant star and then hatching humans from vats. This might sound too far fetched but its actually less complicated than FTL.&lt;/p&gt;

Banks put into words a lot of what I have been thinking lately about life as entertainment and about the point of living.  Obviously I have not had any conclusive thoughts on these matters.  Does anyone?  Aren't we all, constantly, asking ourselves what the point is of experiencing anything when it is all, ultimately, a form of entertainment?  We may not be effectively immortal as Culture humans are, but for most people living in first world countries, our mortality isn't something we have to seriously consider until we get somewhere around 70 or 80 years old and start encountering our first serious health problems that require active management.  Outside of work, everything we do is meant to keep ourselves occupied until we die.  Even eating is a form of entertainment, not survival.

I will sometimes watch sad movies when I'm already feeling sad because I know my mood will enhance how I experience the story.  It's like my own grief is a form of entertainment to me.

One time, during a particularly rough trip (acid) I was thinking about the fact that this hard experience I was having would at least be character forming, or some kind of accomplishment.  I was persevering over hardship.  Then I realized that I'd bought my tab.  I'd bought this experience.  The unpleasant thoughts and visions I was experiencing were nothing more than a form of entertainment.

Isn't love a form of entertainment?  It is impossible to love someone for who THEY think they are.  The person you love is a fabrication based on your perceptions of the original person.  We love because it makes us feel good.  Any kindness toward that person is ultimately motivated by self interest.

Does anything really matter aside from accumulating pleasurable, or at least interesting, experiences just for the sake of experiencing them?  I think every person asks themself this question constantly and probably never arrives at any answer.

Of course there was more to the book than questions about the meaning of life.  The environments Banks built were truly beautiful and a pleasure to read, more so than in any of his novels I've read so far.  Honestly it was nice to see a story take place ""at home"" and not off on a Contact mission.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, first things first. PEANUT MVP!

&gt;""What does 'Peanut' mean?"" Rhi'shul asked. ""'Steel Warrior',"" Erik lied.

First time really seeing the new drones in combat and they do not disappoint. The high-tech hold the door scenario with vibroblades and the hacked car surfing were the high points of the Dul'Rho action scenes. I do wish we got to see more of the other two drones, though. Aside from the action, the croma are a very interesting race, and the book builds up to the 'retirement home' reveal very well. It was heartbreaking. In the political sphere, I'm not sure if I trust Sho'mo'ra the same way I trust Gesul, but right now the croma are the only ones that can break the corbi's living nightmare.

Speaking of which, Tiga... This character and all corbi, god damn. It's an impossible situation for her, and I don't blame her for the choices she makes. So much of this book, or even this series, is an exploration of loyalty to species versus loyalty to galaxy versus loyalty to principles, and what happens when those come into conflict with each other. Final thing before we talk about the finale, multicultural Phoenix crew is awesome! I was hoping that Rhi'shul or other croma would join the zoo, but the political situation doesn't fit and the croma are probably too large for the ship's passages. Human, tavalai, kuhsi, and drysine will do for now, although it looks like we might be getting some corbi in Phoenix's marine company, which I am really happy about. But enough of Dul'Rho, over to Rando.

I'm just going to come right out and say it. The final assault on the Splicer was perhaps one of the greatest literary experiences I've ever read. The whole book was great, but the last 10% just ratchets it up to 11/10. It far exceeds the battles of Tartarus, Gamesh, and Defiance in books 2-4 in the variation and weight of emotions it provokes, although Defiance comes close and definitely has its own spot due to the space battle. Rando Splicer is no Mass Effect 2 where everyone lives and we all go home happily ever after. This is an actual suicide mission.

This isn't like the other battles in this series. The deepynines are goddamn scary, but with drysine support, Phoenix can beat them. But the reeh? The reeh have been setup in the last book as invincible, all-seeing, completely in command of the situation at all times with their insane genetic and network technology. Phoenix was nearly annihilated last time they faced off against them, even Styx was outsmarted. Yet for the Splicer assault the only forces available are untrained corbi, two unarmoured human marines, and the element of surprise. Trace is sure she is going to die. Everyone knows the odds are impossible. As the reader, we know that Erik has progressed to the point where the Major's presence is no longer needed to keep Phoenix running smoothly. It's the perfect time to kill off this important character that's been with us since the beginning. I certainly expected it going in.

Yet when Phoenix Company descended from the sky and blew their way into the hangars, I had hope, counterbalanced by the knowledge of just how close Trace is to total annihilation. Trace and Rika's breakout of the reeh encirclement only to find Giddy's corpse, and the following mad rush from Phoenix Company to get to Trace were the most stressful yet epic parts of the entire battle, contrasted beautifully. In the end, Trace is not saved. Her body survived, but her mind is broken beneath the weight of what she did to the corbi and their world. Perhaps for good.

&gt;""Pena?"" Rika murmured sleepily. ""Is Pen okay?""

I think my mind might be broken too after that.

Rest in peace Pena, Tano, Sigo, Bega, Gideon Kono, all of the heroes who stormed the Splicer, and the many millions who will suffer under reeh retaliation.

In the end, Trace is not saved. Her body survived, but her mind is broken beneath the weight of what she did to the corbi and their world. Perhaps for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pena?&amp;quot; Rika murmured sleepily. &amp;quot;Is Pen okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my mind might be broken too after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace Pena, Tano, Sigo, Bega, Gideon Kono, all of the heroes who stormed the Splicer, and the many millions who will suffer under reeh retaliation. Your sacrifices will never be forgotten. o7&lt;/p&gt;

448,,printSF,"TL;DR: Excellent. Almost a breath of New Weird brought to military SF, and very very welcome.  

I was nervous of this one. I've never been a huge fan of military SF, which tends either to be techwank-thriller or David Drake discipline-fetish stuff. 

But there were a lot of glowing reviews, so fine. 

In a universe where consensus belief can extend the laws of physics in arcane ways, the minutiae of cultural observances (right down to *systems of timekeeping*) in the population can be used as weapons of war - and whoever controls those observances thus controls everything else. 

This sounds like a setup for Warhammer 40k god-emperor, church-of-war kind of thing... but it goes in some really fascinating and unexpected directions instead. With rule divided into separate, semi-rival clans (for reasons of numerology if nothing else), a central unifying authority is absent, leading away from that rather cliched trope. 

What results instead is... strange and rather awesome. 

Sent to re-take a fortress from a group of heretics disrupting the very technology her forces rely on, Kel Cheris enlists the services of an old, disgraced, and very sneaky general to give her an edge. But how far can she trust his motivations? 

That's the basic setup, and it plays out reasonably straightforwardly from there. But oh, the setting and the imagery and the flavour of the book... is unique, intricate and beautiful. 

Since half of warfare in-universe is *semiotic* in nature, the use of icons and banners and symbology and ritual is a crucial part of every consideration - not merely cosmetic, but an integral part of the entire effort. It smacks very slightly of *A Practical Guide to Evil*, though in a much more subtle and integrated way. 

The reader is dumped into the universe without a clue in hell how anything works, and the names of everything from battle formations to the arcane and mostly undescribed weaponry in play leave you utterly confused.. but wanting more. Wanting *so much* more.

I have become a bit of a fan of M John Harrison in the last year or so. His Kefahuchi Tract trilogy has been blowing my mind. So it seemed logical to pick up *In Viriconium*. I like fantasy too, particularly with the weird SF trails and decaying artifacts that this series of - novellas? novels? contains. But...

I had to put it down for about three months towards the end of the book because I honestly couldn't take it any more. I recently came back to finish it off. I admit there were brilliant bits, and sonehow finally getting to the end did create some sense of completeness, but the more welcome feeling was of closure.

I'm curious to know what other readers thought. I found it such hard work, and so meandering that I often lost track of what was supposed to be going on at any given point in the narrative. In *Light*, for example, I would be so exhausted by the prose that I would have to  stop and rest, which I enjoyed, because generally the story was staying  on track but the style was working on me more like poetry, which requires time to digest.

With *In Viriconium* I felt much less satisfied. I would be left with glimpses and impressions of the critique of the genre he was trying to produce, but often found this mired in a sense of confusion and directionless, or that his critique required not returning to characters and refusing at almost every turn to give me any kind of emotional pay off, that I generally found the experience more confusing and depressing than enlightening.

Parts of the stories still stay with me. A general vision of a bleak, empty future, populated with a surprising number of wily, determined dwarves - for reasons I don't understand. Frustration remains as another less satisfying residue.

453,,printSF,"Now I know that much of sci-fi (or what's called sci-fi, i.e. space fantasy, space westerns, etc.) has 90% of its setting and technology decided by repetitive tropes, cliches, drawings by artists unrelated to any known principle of engineering, and poorly rationalized pseudoscience. So it's no surprise that many ships look like toasters or frisbees and have a form that bears no apparent relationship to their mechanical functioning or the logic of space travel and combat.

So that explains why most science fiction ships make no sense. What I am wondering is why rocket ships have fallen completely out of favor? Rocketships, at least in general design, are the single most realistic spacecraft design ever popularized. This is because they are based on the way in which we do, and likely always will, build our high-performance spacecraft: with rockets. And because, if they need to take off from planets, that rocket needs to point at the ground and the body needs to be aerodynamic. Now a ship not meant to take off or travel through atmospheres does *not* need that distinctive rocket shape, though chances are (for interstellar medium, radiation and other considerations) it would still be a series of tubes or modules with a giant rocket at the end. A spaceplane or aerospace vehicle is a bit different, but it's also basically going to be a rocketship with wings and a more neutral orientation for 'down' than a rocketship has.

Having advanced technology would not make rocketships less practical - it would make them MORE practical. If you have very powerful thrusters and very strong materials you will still find that the rocket design is overall the best design, and it's completely obvious why.

Rocketship designs are so obviously the *correct* way to build *any* self-propelled launcher ship that you basically have to invent superscience to explain why and *how* any surface-to-orbit ship could not be shaped like a rocket. And yet I rarely see rocketships, even in relatively hard science fiction. Why? What's wrong with designing something, you know, *correctly?*

Possibly this is something like beam weapons being so popular when the circumstances (close range, low Gs) visible in most sci-fi would make autocannons and missiles clearly superior in basically every way.

Unfortunately, I didn't really find it to be all that great, and I certainly am having a hard time understanding the book's seeming status as a modern classic on this sub. it does have some positives. The Scramblers are really creepy and the initial forays into the Rorschach were like something out of a horror movie. Very well done. The premise of consciousness and sentience being a mistake and unnecessary is interesting as well (however implausible and nonsensical).

There's just no human element to connect to, nothing about anyone that's interesting other than the Unique Scientific Condition Watts decides to inflict them with. Neat idea to have a character who can't feel emotion. Unfortunately dull as hell in execution.

459,,printSF,"I thought I'd try something a little different than the usual sort of recommendation thread.

Background first:  My favorite book of all time is Ender's Game.  I enjoyed the sequel trilogy back when I first read it a long time ago, but then I shifted most of my attention to fantasy after that and only recently have ventured back into science fiction.  I've read all of the available Expanse novels, and absolutely loved (most) of them.  I gave A Fire Upon the Deep a try about a year ago and it just didn't stick with me.  I loved the very beginning of that novel, but it kind of lost me a little after that.  I ended up putting it down and not picking it back up (maybe I can work my way back up to that one).  I just finished Hyperion and while I thought it was pretty great it took me forever to get through.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just that with four kids and a full time job I don't have as much time to read as I'd like (and when I do, I'm exhausted).

I scoured a few recommendation threads and found some books relating to first contact that sounded interesting.  A quick trip to the library after that and I brought home some of these books to decide from.  Feel free to make the case for one of these books and I'll decide over the weekend which one I'll pick up.

The options:

* Salvation - Peter F. Hamilton
* Pushing Ice - Alistair Reynolds
* Eifelheim - Michael Flynn
* Blindsight - Peter Watts
* Foreigner - C.J. Cherryh

I found the following two websites, but neither have Salvation:

EDIT: I managed to find a recap on goodreads, click to reveal.

&gt;!The book starts out with aliens landing on Earth and their form morphs into human form to assimilate into human culture.

&gt;!The story jumps back and forth through time showing humanity at various points, but also following the main characters most of the time. Our characters are brought together as an assessment team to be taken to a new alien ship that they discovered that may have new technology and also somehow has humans on board and it is unknown how they were on the ship. While our characters are enroute to the ship they tell stories of how they know each other that takes us back in time.

&gt;!The first story involves security for Connexion, the company that controls Earth’s portals. Technology created in 2062 using quantum entanglement that lets humans instantly transport via portals across the stars. The character, Callum, falls in love and secretly marries a security officer for the company who is about to go on an undercover mission. During her undercover mission she gets injured in a bomb blast and she is mistaken for one of the terrorists, who are all send to a barren alien world where the company banishes criminals and political opponents. The main character uses his resources to go on a rescue mission where they go to the barren alien planet at the edge of the solar system and rescue his wife, putting him at odds with another character in the story, Yuri, who is head of security for Connexion.

&gt;!Time jumps way forward onto Juloss where human modification is the norm and it seems there is a war between humanity. The characters in the story we have been following are known as “Saints” in the future and we follow a group of humans who are created in the human original image and trained as warriors for battle.

&gt;!The next story follows Yuri, now head of security, in the future who tracks down a missing child. He is tasked with finding out who took the child and getting him back. This leads us through a chase of seedy organized crime and organ snatching and the child is saved at the last minute by Yuri. During the mission one of the operatives is kidnapped.

&gt;!The next flash back takes us to Alik, an FBI agent investigating a mass murder in which two rival gangs kill multiple people in a portal home. It turns out a high end assassin, named Cancer, is also involved and the Gang family members remaining are arrested and sent through a portal to their doom as punishment.


&gt;!Kandara is hired by a Utopian society to find out who is hacking their systems. She discovers hidden signs of sabotage of their industrial plans and believes Cancer is killed during an explosion. It is unknown why someone would sabotage the industrial systems.

&gt;!The story jumps back to the Future where the trainers are older and are still training for their war.

&gt;!Back to the assessment team who finally make it to the alien ship. The ship has an organic brain inside and think the ship was riding a worm hole tunnel and somehow got thrown off course and crash landed. No crew is located but multiple chambers with humans are found in them. All but for one are limbless and have k cell organs giving support to a limbless body. The one intact human is shockingly someone they know from Earth, the Connexion security member that got abducted during Yuri's story. They have him taken out of stasis waiting for him to wake while the crew debates over what this all means and the connection to Cancer and piece together that all of their stories involve Cancer stealing or weakening Earth defenses.

&gt;!Flash back to Feriton Kayne who tells the story how he was sent to spy on the Olyix alien ship by posing as a religious figure sent to visit the ship. He smuggles aboard tiny flying sensors that he sneaks via tunnels to a restricted area of the ship that they believe is hiding part of the alien's secret plans.

&gt;!Flash back forward to the assessment team where he tells them the restricted area on the ship contained ancient pyramid structures probably of religious value from their home world, and not portals to their home world as they suspected. As they are talking Jessika swings an axe, killing Feriton.

&gt;!Flash forward to the future where our human warriors are now on their ship leaving Juloss for war. The captain says a prayer as their ship crosses through a portal and they pray for their Saints: Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik, and Jessika. They finally reveal that they are preparing for war with the Olyix and are setting out to hunt them down.

&gt;!The assessment team looks in amazement as Jessika just cut Feriton's head open with an axe. She reveals that she is an alien known as Neána and she has been posing as a human looking to infiltrate the Olyix. She reveals that the hidden area in the Olyix ship does not contain temples, but a worm hole link to the Olyix home world where they will send an invasion force that will forcefully assimilate humans to join their religious journey to the end of the Galaxy. The team sees that Feriton's brain has been replaced with a Olyix brain and that the Olyix now know about all their activities and will be preparing to invade. She also reveals that the intact human body they found on the Olyix ship was one of her partners who got himself abducted and forced the ship to crash out of the wormhole tunnel. Yuri pulls out a hidden portal he has as they prepare to notify Earth defenses.

&gt;!On the Salvation of Life, the main Olyix ship, they discover that their mole has been killed and their plan is known. They determine that they must “elevate” humans to bring to their God and prepare for their invasion.",t2_4br0c,False,,0,False,Where can I find a recap of Salvation by Peter F Hamilton?,[],r/printSF,False,6,,0,False,t3_dvpv3i,False,dark,,public,41,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,41,,False,,1573649821.0,,[],{},,True,,1573669476.0,text,6,,,text,self.printSF,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really struggle with remembering what happened in books, particularly because I read quite a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts out with aliens landing on Earth and their form morphs into human form to assimilate into human culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story jumps back and forth through time showing humanity at various points, but also following the main characters most of the time. Our characters are brought together as an assessment team to be taken to a new alien ship that they discovered that may have new technology and also somehow has humans on board and it is unknown how they were on the ship. While our characters are enroute to the ship they tell stories of how they know each other that takes us back in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story involves security for Connexion, the company that controls Earth’s portals. Technology created in 2062 using quantum entanglement that lets humans instantly transport via portals across the stars. The character, Callum, falls in love and secretly marries a security officer for the company who is about to go on an undercover mission. During her undercover mission she gets injured in a bomb blast and she is mistaken for one of the terrorists, who are all send to a barren alien world where the company banishes criminals and political opponents. The main character uses his resources to go on a rescue mission where they go to the barren alien planet at the edge of the solar system and rescue his wife, putting him at odds with another character in the story, Yuri, who is head of security for Connexion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time jumps way forward onto Juloss where human modification is the norm and it seems there is a war between humanity. The characters in the story we have been following are known as “Saints” in the future and we follow a group of humans who are created in the human original image and trained as warriors for battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next story follows Yuri, now head of security, in the future who tracks down a missing child. He is tasked with finding out who took the child and getting him back. This leads us through a chase of seedy organized crime and organ snatching and the child is saved at the last minute by Yuri. During the mission one of the operatives is kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next flash back takes us to Alik, an FBI agent investigating a mass murder in which two rival gangs kill multiple people in a portal home. It turns out a high end assassin, named Cancer, is also involved and the Gang family members remaining are arrested and sent through a portal to their doom as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kandara is hired by a Utopian society to find out who is hacking their systems. She discovers hidden signs of sabotage of their industrial plans and believes Cancer is killed during an explosion. It is unknown why someone would sabotage the industrial systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story jumps back to the Future where the trainers are older and are still training for their war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the assessment team who finally make it to the alien ship. The ship has an organic brain inside and think the ship was riding a worm hole tunnel and somehow got thrown off course and crash landed. No crew is located but multiple chambers with humans are found in them. All but for one are limbless and have k cell organs giving support to a limbless body. The one intact human is shockingly someone they know from Earth, the Connexion security member that got abducted during Yuri&amp;#39;s story. They have him taken out of stasis waiting for him to wake while the crew debates over what this all means and the connection to Cancer and piece together that all of their stories involve Cancer stealing or weakening Earth defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash back to Feriton Kayne who tells the story how he was sent to spy on the Olyix alien ship by posing as a religious figure sent to visit the ship. He smuggles aboard tiny flying sensors that he sneaks via tunnels to a restricted area of the ship that they believe is hiding part of the alien&amp;#39;s secret plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash back forward to the assessment team where he tells them the restricted area on the ship contained ancient pyramid structures probably of religious value from their home world, and not portals to their home world as they suspected. As they are talking Jessika swings an axe, killing Feriton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to the future where our human warriors are now on their ship leaving Juloss for war. The captain says a prayer as their ship crosses through a portal and they pray for their Saints: Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik, and Jessika. They finally reveal that they are preparing for war with the Olyix and are setting out to hunt them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment team looks in amazement as Jessika just cut Feriton&amp;#39;s head open with an axe. She reveals that she is an alien known as Neána and she has been posing as a human looking to infiltrate the Olyix. She reveals that the hidden area in the Olyix ship does not contain temples, but a worm hole link to the Olyix home world where they will send an invasion force that will forcefully assimilate humans to join their religious journey to the end of the Galaxy. The team sees that Feriton&amp;#39;s brain has been replaced with a Olyix brain and that the Olyix now know about all their activities and will be preparing to invade. She also reveals that the intact human body they found on the Olyix ship was one of her partners who got himself abducted and forced the ship to crash out of the wormhole tunnel. Yuri pulls out a hidden portal he has as they prepare to notify Earth defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Salvation of Life, the main Olyix ship, they discover that their mole has been killed and their plan is known. They determine that they must “elevate” humans to bring to their God and prepare for their invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

506,,printSF,"Well, that was... perplexing. We have the trademark Hamilton-esque multitude of characters, but none of them stands out in the way of, say, a Gore Burnelli or Paula Myo (as clichèd as they were); we have the Young Lovers, the Strong Female Warrior, the Rich Guy, the Smart but Misguided kid, the Tough Policeman, blah blah: you could replace a few names with their equivalent from the Commonwealth and it'd be barely noticeable.

I am new to the community, but a question has bugged me for years after I read the book, and especially after I have watched the movie many times. 

My uncle had many, many, volumes of short SyFi stories, especially the ""Years Best Science Fiction"" and I spent many hours reading them as a young teenager. 

To my question. I distinctly remember a short story in where the Earth receives an extrasolar signal that is decoded into instructions for a vehicle. It is built and a similar occurence happens. 

The differance is that it was similar to a rocket sled. The engines ignite and, according to the outside observers, only run for moments before shutting down. However, the vehicle never moves. The occupant experiences a first contact over a significantly longer time, but is discredited.

I still have access to all of my, now deceased, uncle's library but have never been able to find this story. It has bugged me for some time. I don't think I am confusing it with the book Contact though. I distinctly remember a differant design of vehicle.

**The guy published four distinct works this year, for a total of 1432 pages**, plus a short story in an anthology. Similar number in 2018. And these aren't junk pulp fiction books, but genuinely some of the best speculative fiction of our time.

Is the man a real human? An army of a billion monkeys hitting away on typewriters? A pseudonym for a group of genius scientist authors? 


And sure, people around these parts like Children of Time (which I loved), and some occasionally mention Children of Ruin (which I found pretty good, but less so than CoT) and Dogs of War (which I found lacking - it's basically a long elaboration on one idea), yet, to me, those fan favorites are all in the Asimov-realm of SciFi: Great ideas, but not particularly beautiful prose, nor deep characters.

A few days ago I've seen Cage of Souls [recommended on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dp685w/your_thoughts_on_cage_of_souls_by_adrian/), and man, am I grateful for that. Such magnificent world building, paired with a prose and wit that I didn't associate with Tchaikovsky thus far.

2) Interesting causes for an apocalyptic scenario.

3) Technology that existed in a society just prior to its end, what kind of technology would that be? How would it affect people in a resource scarce environment?

4) how does an economy work in a resource scarce environment?

560,,printSF,"I'm looking for some recommendations for books that are harder on the scale of science fiction hardness. Not necessarily super hard, but more along the lines of The Expanse or Revelation Space rather than Star Trek, if that helps. Looking for recommendations from the last +-20 years too. 

Ideally, I'm looking for novels or series with exo-planet colonization, first contact, AI, cloning, or military sci-fi. Preferably no artificial gravity, FTL or star fighters please. Individual books or series can cover one or more of the above subjects please. I'm really picky about writing style as well, so I'll give some examples of books that I did and didn't like below:

**Liked:**

\- The Expanse (James S.A. Corey) - Love these guys and the story overall, even if I don't like some of the books as much as others. By far my favourite writers in terms of style. 

\- Revelation Space and Revenger (Alastair Reynolds) - the writing and pacing can be uneven but I'll basically read whatever he writes because to a layperson like me it reads like it's plausible.

\- Frontlines (Marko Kloos) - don't like the artificial gravity but I appreciate his military focus and experience. There's not much worse than reading mil-sci-fi from someone that doesn't know squat about the military. Big plus that the writing is also decent.

\- Old Man's War and Collapsing Empire (John Scalzi) - lots of handwaving but I really like his writing style. 

\- The Martian and Artemis (Andy Weir) - liked the relatively hard sci-fi and writing style. The characters were likable too.

\- Something Coming Through (Paul McAuley) - liked his style and the apparent hardness of the sci-fi.

\- Confederation (Tanya Huff) - Liked the writing style. The story was a bit too pulpy and not at all hard sci-fi, but I think I read six books in the series, so something resonated with me. 

**Disliked/Neutral:**

\- The Commonwealth Saga and Night's Dawn (Peter F. Hamilton). Liked the premise in The Commonwealth Saga but PFH's writing style, particularly the pacing, just kills me. Not sure why I tried Night's Dawn, but I regretted it.

\- Anything by Mike Resnick. Probably my least favourite writer.

\- Anything by John Ringo. Probably my second least favourite writer. 

\- Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Becky Chambers) - just couldn't stand the writing style. The sci-fi was soft but I did like the premise generally.

\- Coyote (Allen Steele, I think) - Liked the premise, bored to tears by the execution.

\- Dread Empire's Fall (Walter Jon Williams) - felt like it was just OK, the space bits were good but the planetside stuff was not appealing to me.

\- The Company Wars (C.J. Cherryh) - I've tried this one a few times and keep giving up after a little while. 

\- Imperial Radch (Ann Leckie) - Tried it and DNF'd after about 30%.

564,,printSF,"This one wasn't quite as engaging, although I still enjoyed it. I think a big part of it is that in Red Mars especially we were right there with the First Hundred as they changed the world around them but in Blue Mars the change largely happens outside the story and we only see its outcomes. The entire series is about the growth of Martian civilisation, so without that the plot becomes rather thin. 

This book was heavily character focused instead and a key theme was characters not being able to recapture their past, including Michel with Provence, Nadia with the first days on Mars, and Ann with pre-colonial Mars. It seemed very fitting theme given the age of the characters and the amount of change on Earth and Mars during their lives. Of course it was all build-up for the memory treatment, which I honestly didn't love, but it was nice to see the characters find a bit more satisfaction in their lives. 

I really loved the constitutional congress at the start. Not just because Nadia and Art are amazing, but because I loved the process of designing an ideal society. Of course it turned out less than utopian (I was worried he might have abandoned realism) but still a great achievement. It was a little depressing how readily the rest of the solar system adopted tribalism as the expansion continued. 

I again really enjoyed Maya’s PoV and Part 12 was one of my favorites. I don't know why but something about her brings out the poeticism of KSR’s writing like no other character does. 
&gt;“Inside her ticked a bomb. In the old days it had had 3 billion ticks, more or less. Now they had rigged it to have 10 billion - or more - or less. The ticks kept ticking nevertheless.” 

&gt;“She stopped, stilled by something in the double vision, by a realisation - or the edge of an epiphany - and felt some vast truth pushing at her, just outside her - or inside her body, even, inside her skull but outside her thoughts, pushing at the dura that encased the brain - everything explained, everything come clear at last, for once.” 

Passages like these (from consecutive pages) really appeal to me, as do the descriptions of Mars which seem more vivid through Maya's perspective. 

I lost a bit of interest in the final sections with Sax and Ann, particularly when their boat turned into Dorothy's house from The Wizard of Oz (seriously what was that about?) but the epilogue (if not in name) with the remnants of the First Hundred taking the newest generation to the beach was delightful. The writing was beautiful as ever and it was a really good way to symbolise Ann’s acceptance of life on Mars and the end of the First Hundred’s story.

I know this is incredibly immature of me but I can't read the line “Uranus fat in the middle of it, the sun a blazing jewel just to one side,” and not laugh. I just can't.

I noticed in a recent thread,
https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dajd9m/psychadelic_sci_fi/ 
that most of the recs are older. Is there anything newer (and good) in this genre?

Older recs:

* Naked Lunch by Burroughs (1959)
* PKD books are from 1962-1980
* Camp Concentration by Disch (1967)
* Lord of Light by Zelazny (1967)
* Dhalgren by Delaney (1975)
* Illuminatus Trilogy by RAW and Shea (1975)
* Vurt by Noon (1993)
* The Invisibles by Morrison (1994)

What I know of which qualifies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of, containing, generating, or reminiscent of drug-induced hallucinations, distortions of perception, altered awareness etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed in a recent thread,
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dajd9m/psychadelic_sci_fi/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/dajd9m/psychadelic_sci_fi/&lt;/a&gt; 
that most of the recs are older. Is there anything newer (and good) in this genre?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older recs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naked Lunch by Burroughs (1959)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PKD books are from 1962-1980&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp Concentration by Disch (1967)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lord of Light by Zelazny (1967)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dhalgren by Delaney (1975)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illuminatus Trilogy by RAW and Shea (1975)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vurt by Noon (1993)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Invisibles by Morrison (1994)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I know of which qualifies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promethea by Alan Moore (2000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kefahuchi Tract trilogy by M John Harrison (2002)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inherent Vice (?) by Pynchon (2009)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

601,,printSF,"I used to read a lot of random science fiction from my dad's collection some 15-20 years ago, and a lot of them really stuck to my head. It's been ages since then though and my memories are pretty blurry, and I could be mixing them up with each other, so apologies in advance if the explanations suck. But there's:

**Firstly**, A short story where some kind of aliens had invaded and colonised Earth and forced humanity to live on the moon as exiles. It's about a pair of friends who go see an old person in some remote area, who talks about good old times and some history.

I remember the story focusing on themes of gender quite a bit: apparently changing one's gender was quite common in this society, and the pair of friends had done it quite a few times too (it might've been that the other friend was currently a girl and they were having a sexual relationship). The old man seemed to look down on such shenanigans.

**Secondly**, A short story *collection* about a somewhat morally ambiguous inventor/scientist in an extremely advanced space-faring society. I remember it being quite satirical / tongue in cheek in tone, and from the collection, I remember two stories in particular: 

One in which the inventor's friend creates some kind of a microplanet with its own people, culture and civilisation, and then proceeds to rule over as essentially a god. The protagonist inventor disapproves: at the end of the story, it's discovered the society has advanced massively in technology, and they've rebelled and killed the friend.

And two, where the inventor is hired to ""assassinate"" the king/ruler of some world by putting him into a virtual reality machine so pleasant he won't want to wake up. He goes through several iterations that all fail due to the king's stubbornness, until finally he makes a simulation that's essentially an infinite nested Matryoshka dolls, a kind of an endlessly layered dream-within-a-dream that he can never wake out of.

**Thirdly**, and by far most vaguely, I seem to recall a short story with more or less the exact plot of that humorous [The Onion interview](https://i.imgur.com/Mpfdcm1.png).

A few changes - before I pick a book, I do a sneaky peek on its reviews on [goodreads.com](https://goodreads.com). Its helped weed out some of the curly ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

**An absolute pleasure to read:**

**Dogs of War ( Tchaikovsky ).** This book is great fun. Good action and the story is from the perspective of a dog, done quite well!

**Salvation (Hamilton).** His books are typically epic space operas with incredible action and world building, but with lots of fluff and useless characters in between. Hamilton has really hit his mark here. The fluff is cut down,  the story is more concise and retains the qualities of his other works. I loved the setting on Zagreus, very chilling.

**Nexus/ Crux/ Apex ( Ramez ).** The common theme with these top books are that they jump straight into the story from page 1, no exception here. Very detailed series on mind alteration technologies. Books 2 and 3 did drag on some but still enjoyable.

**Blue Remembered Earth / On the Steel Breeze ( Reynolds ).** Cool concepts in this hard scifi book. I really appreciate a book where the protagonists are every-day Gregs and save themselves with wits rather than the usual combat.

**Time and time again (  Elton ).** An easy fun read. Might not be quite up with the previous entries but the historical setting was a refreshing change.

 **Redemption  (Baxter).** Final (?) book of his outstanding Xeelee series. Just go and read them.

**In the mouth of the whale (McAuley).** This is part of his Quiet War series, and could be a standalone. The battle around the gas giant is the most authentic and riveting space battle I can think of in any scifi book. This series and the Xeelee books are my favourite 2 scifi series.

**Skyward  (Branderson).** Technically its a young adult book, but nonetheless a real page turner.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Good**

**Empire Games/Dark State (Charles Stross)**. Well written story and unique ideas, I just find the whole concept of 'parallel dimensions' pretty lame and more of a fantasy trope.

 **Ancestral night  ( Bear ).** This book had nice far-future ideas but it written from the perspective of an edgy youngster which is slightly grating. Misses the slick prose of the books above.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the story included the computer *itself* thinking on a grand scale about other machine intelligences that could have developed in the universe. It became concerned that any one of these other possible machine intelligences could became nihilistic or adversarial to the existence of the universe as we know it.

If such a machine intelligence developed this nihilistic outlook, then it could create self-replicating subatomic nanobots that destroy organized matter itself.

It eventually thought a way through to protect against this, and manipulated the various main characters to execute its plan.

I'd be wary of Cixin. He's a CCP stooge and supports their camps.

Edit: A direct quote from the New Yorker: 

When I brought up the mass internment of Muslim Uighurs—around a million are now in reëducation camps in the northwestern province of Xinjiang—he trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: “Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty.”

And here is another: 

""If China were to transform into a democracy, it would be hell on earth,” he said. “I would evacuate tomorrow, to the United States or Europe or—I don’t know.” The irony that the countries he was proposing were democracies seemed to escape his notice. He went on, “Here’s the truth: if you were to become the President of China tomorrow, you would find that you had no other choice than to do exactly as he has done.” 

And yet another: 

His views turned out to be staunch and unequivocal. The infamous one-child policy, he said, had been vital: “Or else how could the country have combatted its exploding population growth?” He was deaf to the argument that the population growth was itself the result of a previous policy, from the fifties, in which the Party had declared that “a larger population means greater manpower.” Liu took a similarly pragmatic view of a controversial funeral-reform law, which mandates cremation, even though the tradition of “returning to the ground” has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. (There were reports of elderly people committing suicide in order to be buried before the ban went into effect.) “If there are dead bodies everywhere, where are we supposed to plant crops?” Liu said. “Humans must adjust their habits to accommodate changing circumstances.”",t2_ogzu7,False,,0,False,Controversy Surrounding Liu Cixin,[],r/printSF,False,6,,0,False,t3_dma1ha,False,dark,,public,59,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,59,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1571913092.0,text,6,,,text,self.printSF,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen some comments regarding Cixin&amp;#39;s works, and I guess I&amp;#39;ve taken it upon myself to make sure people stay informed.

They were still fun books, but the fun drastically went away when it turned into politics and 80% of the plot revolved around humans again !&lt;

Expeditionary Force has an AI, and the books had potential at first, [but were just too meh for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/91uor8/does_expeditionary_force_get_any_better_spoilers/)

Don't even get me started on Blindsight. Are we humans, or are we dancing Vampires with cyborg implants. Cyborgs were the worst thing to happen to Sci-fi -_-

I'm about to drop Ancillary Justice, I'm several hours in, and it's literally ""AI monologues with humans about human morals and human psychology, the book"". Please, someone tell me this series gets better and focuses on the, y'know, multi thousand year old artificial intelligence instead of random political trash

&lt;p&gt;For example, do people still read short stories in magazines anymore? There’s only a few left and they seem to be on the softer end of the spectrum.  Is all the action in novels instead of shorts?  I want to start reading current stuff so I know what to aspire to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: how have you found your favorite recent stories? Anthologies? Kindle Singles? Author websites? Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thx.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m transgender, born male and currently live as female, beginning transition 2.5 years ago at age 22.

This book leans heavily into the idea of dualism, and how our society is lacking because of our requirement to separate one side from another, and how that prevents us from seeing the whole picture.

I work in healthcare, where sometimes I perform EKGs. When you have to do an EKG, you are naked waist up, something very uncomfortable for many women (understandably).

So now I’m reading this book where gender has no impact on society since there is no binary gender, where fluidity is expected and cultivated, and the idea that “there would be no shadow without light” is common thought. 

It made me think of our society, one where I am treated differently just because of my looks on the outside.

Where people, both men and women, are more comfortable telling me their feelings, their secrets, letting me become a more intimate part of their lives just because I now have long hair and wear makeup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is a series of decisions based on previous presumptions, and this book reminded me of this in a way that left me too stunned to speak. There is no I if there is no you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening to me ramble.&lt;/p&gt;

John Barlow, a racist and vulgar conman and real estate developer from 1988, accidentally ends up in suspended animation. He wakes up in the future. Society changed. Now the majority of intelligent people have been bred out by the dumb. There's a small minority of intelligent people but they feel oppressed by the majority because they have to do the significant heavy lifting to keep society running. So they want Barlow to fix this problem and so he demands to become world dictator. Apparently 20th century people are the only one's self interested enough to devise a plan. His plan is to convince all the morons 99% of people to nationalistically rush to Venus to become the first nation to colonize it. And it works using lessons he learned from Hitler and they all die in space. In the end, the intelligent people put him in a rocket too because they hate the self-interested, pragmatic and far-sighted people of the 20th century who created the problem in the first place. He dies.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is this story supposed to be satirizing? Unlike the story Fahrenheit 451, it can't be a commentary on culture, the morons are truly genetically inferior, not just distracted by popular entertainment. In fact it feels like its strongly endorsing prejudice against those with low intelligence. Or does it? After all Barlow is written very abrasively. A conman and racist that knows all about Hitler. So I would have expected the intelligent congress to stop his plan but they go along with it.  Perhaps this passage says it all

&gt;""This of it. You were a blind, selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic and social conditions which penalized child-bearing by the prudent and foresighted. You made us what we are today, and I want you to know that we are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damn-fool automobiles! Damn-fool cities with overhead ramps!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""As far as I can see,"" said Barlow, ""you're running down the best features of time. Are you crazy?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The rockets aren't rockets. They're turbo-jets—good turbo-jets, but the fancy shell around them makes for a bad drag. The automobiles have a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour—a kilometer is, if I recall my paleolinguistics, three-fifths of a mile—and the speedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think they're going two hundred and fifty. The cities are ridiculous, expensive, unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who'd be better off and more productive if they were spread over the countryside.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We need the rockets and trick speedometers and cities because, w**hile you and your kind were being prudent and foresighted and not having children, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were shiftlessly and short-sightedly having children—breeding, breeding.** My God, how they bred!""

Perhaps Kornbluth is just calling his fellow intelligentsia to have more babies to crowd out the migrant workers? Seems pretty classist though

About 1 hr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Barlow, a racist and vulgar conman and real estate developer from 1988, accidentally ends up in suspended animation. He wakes up in the future. Society changed. Now the majority of intelligent people have been bred out by the dumb. There&amp;#39;s a small minority of intelligent people but they feel oppressed by the majority because they have to do the significant heavy lifting to keep society running. So they want Barlow to fix this problem and so he demands to become world dictator. Apparently 20th century people are the only one&amp;#39;s self interested enough to devise a plan. His plan is to convince all the morons 99% of people to nationalistically rush to Venus to become the first nation to colonize it. And it works using lessons he learned from Hitler and they all die in space. In the end, the intelligent people put him in a rocket too because they hate the self-interested, pragmatic and far-sighted people of the 20th century who created the problem in the first place. He dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this story supposed to be satirizing? Unlike the story Fahrenheit 451, it can&amp;#39;t be a commentary on culture, the morons are truly genetically inferior, not just distracted by popular entertainment. In fact it feels like its strongly endorsing prejudice against those with low intelligence. Or does it? After all Barlow is written very abrasively. A conman and racist that knows all about Hitler. So I would have expected the intelligent congress to stop his plan but they go along with it.  Perhaps this passage says it all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This of it. You were a blind, selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic and social conditions which penalized child-bearing by the prudent and foresighted. You made us what we are today, and I want you to know that we are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damn-fool automobiles! Damn-fool cities with overhead ramps!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As far as I can see,&amp;quot; said Barlow, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re running down the best features of time. Are you crazy?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The rockets aren&amp;#39;t rockets. They&amp;#39;re turbo-jets—good turbo-jets, but the fancy shell around them makes for a bad drag. The automobiles have a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour—a kilometer is, if I recall my paleolinguistics, three-fifths of a mile—and the speedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think they&amp;#39;re going two hundred and fifty. The cities are ridiculous, expensive, unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who&amp;#39;d be better off and more productive if they were spread over the countryside.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need the rockets and trick speedometers and cities because, w&lt;strong&gt;hile you and your kind were being prudent and foresighted and not having children, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were shiftlessly and short-sightedly having children—breeding, breeding.&lt;/strong&gt; My God, how they bred!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Kornbluth is just calling his fellow intelligentsia to have more babies to crowd out the migrant workers? Seems pretty classist though&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Descriptions of hand-to-hand combat or sports.  Every time I read about these I imagine I am watching an action movie with a lot of scene cuts. I don’t know what’s happening.  I don’t get a mind’s view of the action. I don’t like them. What I like are different combat descriptions. In one book there was a action scene where the enemy used a tornado to destroy. In other scene another books used a crushed star to create beams. Fortunately there are few scenes like these in the books I read.

&amp;#x200B;

What I like

infodumps. This is what mainstream literary snubs hate about sf books. I love it when a book introduces a new term or something and then starts telling me a little bit about it. And then the book keeps telling me more and more about the thing in the next chapters. I am not a fan of “show don’t tell”. I think infodumps are necessary in sf books because of world building.

sex scenes, love scenes or feelings scenes. Ok, I understand. Writers are humans writing about humans and humans do these things. When I read them I roll my eyes. They are a necessary evil.

1. **a significant theme (whether explicitly or by obvious implication) is the exploration of what it means to be a human, or to live/be treated as human ; AND**

Here are some examples of the way the above themes could be explored in an interesting way (but I'm open to anything else!):

1. where ""normal"" humans and modified humans are treated differently by others or their society (socially, politically, legally);
2. where a modified human has more/less rights, or tries to assert/fight for their rights;
3. where a modified human tries to become, or be treated like, a ""normal human"" (or vice versa);
4. where a person has to grapple with the changes that come with transitioning from one form to another;
5. where a person finds themself having to deal with the law or other authority structure (eg police, government), because of something relating to their being a modified or ""normal"" human;
6. (edit:) where society, authority or law tries to restrict the use/proliferation of the technology because it is perceived to be a threat (eg to the moral/social fabric of society).

I think it may benefit from starting out as a PnP RPG game, the lore feels very well thought out and developed. Probably also creates a good framework for authors to work with. Obviously, the writers have their differences, but all in all, the books fit together quite well IMO. I'm usually not such a fan of multiple authors working with the same universe, but so far so good. 

I've read the Secrets of Power trilogy (good place to start) and Dragonheart Saga trilogy as well as a few stand alone novels... of those, I especially enjoyed Worlds Without End (best read before the Dragonheart saga, though ok after too) as well as Dark Resonance. Fistful of Data was good fun. The only one that put me off was Burning Bright... which I liked fine until the last 10-15% and then the main character annoyed the fuck out of me.

A huge part of the appeal of these books is how realistic they feel, and a big part of that is the conflict between characters.

Maya was one of my favourite characters in this book. I was frustrated by her characterisation for the first two thirds - too much a caricature-  but once she got her PoV her complexity from Red Mars returned, better than ever. I find her a very compelling character. Part 9 is the longest of the book and I was very hesitant once I saw it was Maya’s perspective, but her time in Odessa was one of my favourite sections of the book. KSR really hit his stride with the gorgeous descriptions of the areoforming and Maya’s tortured relationship to her past and future.

699,,printSF,"Let me begin by saying that this series is one of best sets of print SF books I've ever read, and I say that as an avid fan of the genre.  It joins the like of the *Hyperion Cantos*, *A Scanner Darkly*, *Dune,* and the *Culture* books among my all time favorite PrintSF. But there's one surprising issue - **there are no believable romantic relationships in the whole series.**

It's actually striking how few relationships feature at all. The relationship between Yang Dong (the young physicist who commits suicide early on in *TBP*) and her boyfriend Ding Yi isn't really explored at all, not even in reflections, despite Ding Yi's prominence as an important character in *The Dark Forest*. The same is true of her mother, the brilliant physicist Ye Wenjie, and her husband, Yang Weining; despite some passages showing their professional relationship, we never get any real insight into their interpersonal dynamic, and barely a few pages after their marriage is reported, Yang is tumbling off a cliff. Protagonist of *TBP* Wang Miao has a wife and son, but they're not mentioned at all past Chapter 6, which struck me as a bit bizarre even while I was reading. I could go on and on through the other important characters in the series: Wade, Guan Yifan, Zhang Beihai, Da Shi, Rey Diaz, Fred Tyler - their romantic lives if mentioned at all are dealt with by a throwaway line about a divorce at most.

There are really only three romantic relationships spelled out in any detail: Wallfacer Bill Hines and his scientist wife Keiko; Cheng Xin, protagonist of *Death's End*, and her brainy admirer Yun Tianming; and Wallfacer Luo Ji and his 'dream girl' Zhuang Yan. All of these have big problems. Bill and Keiko are the closest we get to a normal relationship but they're not really *major* characters (plus, she is his Wallbreaker). As for Cheng Xin and Yun Tianming, well, it's not even really clear what kind of romantic feelings are there. Of course the relationship is never physically consummated in any way, but there's also no reason to think the characters know each other particularly well - big feelings, sure, but little in the way of calibration.

So let's talk briefly about Luo Ji and Zhuang Yan. This relationship puzzled me beyond belief. The idea of Luo Ji falling in love with a girl in his head was very nicely done, but it kind of undercut things when he 'found' her in real life. Despite a couple of nice scenes in the Louvre, we never get much of a sense of their interpersonal dynamic, or how their relationship grew over the years. And we never really get a picture of what they see in each other - Luo Ji has this intense desire to protect her, sure, but what's that based on? And why does she fall for him? There was great potential here to explore the mismatch between the idealised pictures of our partners we construct in our heads and the more complicated realities that result from conjoining two lives. For example, what if Zhuang Yan had turned out to have traits that Luo Ji found annoying, or less than perfect? What if he then realised the girl in his head also had these traits?

If this was a Western novel, I'd describe the depictions of romance as *adolescent* \- it's all beautiful smiles and sunlight glinting in hair, not the kind of complex processes of vulnerability, connection, understanding, and compromise that characterize actual real life relationships. However, as striking as the shallow nature of the relationships on display is the fact that they're largely absent.

Let me be clear here that I don't like it when romantic plots are forced into stories inappropriately, something that happens all the time in Hollywood. When there are great world-deciding crises unfolding, we don't need to have the hero and heroine decide to fall madly in love. But given that the pacing in the series includes many times and places where the crisis isn't looming (at least in the minds of the participants), as well as many characters in late youth or early middle age for whom family would seemingly be important, this absence doesn't seem to reflect a judicious choice on the part of the author as much as a slightly bizarre lacuna.

So I have a few thoughts. First, it could just be the character of the author - not everyone finds writing and reading about relationships interesting, and it's possible Liu Cixin doesn't have the patience or appetite to include them in his books (incidentally, I was surprised to learn that [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin#Personal_life), his wife and daughter don't read his work). 

Second, it could partly be a difference in genre style; my wife is from Asia and reads a lot of Chinese fiction, and while she hasn't read this series yet, she did suggest to me that explicit close-up ""psychologising"" of protagonists' romantic feelings is a stronger trait of the Western romantic tradition, with Asian authors leaving much more up to the imagination of the reader to fill out (Haruki Murakami - another of my favourite Asian authors - strikes me as an exception here, but perhaps he's a bit of an outlier stylistically).

Third, there's maybe a sexuality issue. However absent romance is from the series, sex is yet more absent - I can't recall a single time that a character has sex or even reflects on having done so in the past. At most we get references to lovers and a few awkward catcalls. Yet if you want to write good romance, you need to bring sex into play (unless you're Jane Austen, of course). Doing that narrows your audience base, perhaps, but also risks censorious judgment. I don't know enough about the culture around sex in China, but the little I know suggests to me that it's possible that Liu decided he'd have an easier time pitching and promoting his novel if he kept it clean.

I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this issue. I also have a final related puzzle: what the hell happened to Zhuang Yan and Luo Ji's daughter? The ending of *The Dark Forest* sets them up as a happy family, but they don't appear once in *Death's End*. I know we're told that they left Luo Ji two years after the Deterrence era began, and there are two interpretations as to why (namely he's an asshole, or he wanted to protect them), but the mystery created by this throwaway line is never resolved. Were they already dead and gone by the time of the Bunker Era? Didn't it occur to Luo Ji to get them - or his grandchild - onto the lightspeed ship, and save them from the solar system's destruction? It really felt like - much like Conan Doyle and Mrs Watson - Liu Cixin realised he'd created an extraneous narrative thread and hastily dropped it. That was a real disappointment to me, as it seemed like there was a lot of potential there.

Would love to hear the thoughts of other readers!",t2_a8hrp,False,,0,False,"Just finished the Liu Cixin's masterful Three Body Problem series.

I didn't plan to go at all until I saw that Ted Chiang was a featured author and that he would be there. So, being a huge fan, I attended his event.

I figured he would do an interview-style session where a moderator sat down with him and the audience just listened, but instead, he gave a talk - more or less him reading aloud an essay he had written about the differences between science and magic. It was interesting; he went into how there's a distinct difference between the two and how intention and functionality and humanity help to make the distinction between them, rather than setting or time period.

It was also interesting to just see and hear him in person. Speaking for myself, certain powerful works can impact the way I think or view the world, so those works and their authors can often take on a larger-than-life persona in my head. But Ted was, of course, just a guy. Fast-talking and a little awkward. After his reading, he took audience questions and, during his responses, he said ""you know?"" a lot as a little vocal tick, similar to how people say ""uh"" or ""um."" Except, combined with his fast rate of speech, it came out as ""y'ow?"" which was funny to me. All of that to say, it's just refreshing to see and hear that these people we look up to, some of which have greatly impacted our lives, are just people too. It's inspiring.

If anyone is curious, during the Q&amp;A session, he answered my question (how do you overcome being a ""slow writer,"" as some people have called you?) by saying he agrees that he is a slow writer, but that he no longer thinks that's a negative thing. Some people write quickly, some people enjoy the process of writing or can't help but to write - but, for him, he does neither of those things, and he's only recently started to embrace that. And, as a slow writer myself, it was heartening to hear him say that and to see that Ted has become successful despite the fact.

The books I've read through and enjoyed the most lately are some of the halo books and the **Three Body** series, **Ball Lightning**, **Artemis** and **The Martian** for two different reasons, mainly, I think. 

First, they both are near enough into the future or take place in a form of humanity that is recognizable in technologies to me, and not so foreign that I don't even know what they're talking about.

Second, the new phenomena and technologies in these books seem to be explained very well so that a concept that I would have considered completely foreign actually seems natural to me.

721,,printSF,"I just finished Diaspora. Great book! I especially thought the concept of Wang's carpets were amazing. And I really loved how he really embraced the change of values that these people have, with regards to how they perceive identity. They're not afraid of any of their physical forms dying, what they're afraid of is changing too much, especially if they leave one of their earlier copies in stasis, and not being able to re-merge, because that would be too much ""like"" dying. Or that making clones of yourself that differ in just enough of a way that they have no place anywhere is a major sacrifice, because you might ""be"" one of those clones.

But there were a few things about the cosmology (particularly the dimensional structure of the universe) that didn't make much sense to me, or at least wasn't consistent with the way the characters were behaving.

The way I understand it:

Our home 3+1 dimensional universe has the topology of a 4-sphere. And it has 6 microscopic closed dimensions (similar to the tiny dimensions in String Theory, which we do freely move through, and our particles vibrate through, but they're just so small that we don't notice them), which itself is shaped as a 6-sphere, and has the Lorentz signature -+++++ (so it has its own time dimension). Each point in our 4D spacetime is basically its own 6-dimensional universe that are independent of each other (beings in that universe can move freely through their 5 spatial dimensions, but not our 3 spatial dimensions; we're like a ""macro-sphere"" to them). Similarly, we have 6 ""macro"" dimensions (5+1 again), which is to us what we are to our micro-universes. So each point in the macro-6-sphere is its own 4D universe similar to ours (in terms of scale and dimensionality), but to all of our 4D universes there's only one macro-6-sphere universe. (This asymmetry bothered me for a while, until I realized that it's because we are micro-dimensions to them, so their objects *span* our 4 dimensions, but ours don't span theirs, we only span our own micro-dimensions.) However, the macro 6-sphere has its *own* macro-4 sphere, to which the size of its 6 dimensions are microscopic. So even though there's only one macro-6-sphere to all of our infinite 4-D universes, there's still infinite of those 6-spheres spanning the space of its macro 4-sphere. And this pattern basically goes on infinitely in both directions (towards the larger-scaled and smaller-scaled universes).

That's all well and good. However, the characters in the book often have ways of talking that conflict with this picture. This is not due to the fact that they didn't know the full picture until near the end, because often the things they said conflicted with what they already did know.

First of all, why did they treat every scale of universe as if it shared the same time dimension? The home universe is 3+1 dimensions, and the macro-sphere (the one that's one level ""above"" the home universe) is 5+1 dimensions, which is *separate* from the 3+1 of our universe. Our ""time"" is just part of the microscopic spherical universe that they don't notice in their universe, and their ""time"" is a totally separate dimension. Yet, characters often say things like that the Transmuters have been here for ""at least a billion years"", because they left the home universe a billion years ago. Or they can avoid the galactic core explosion in the home universe by ""waiting it out"" in the macrosphere... as if spending time in the macrosphere implies that the same time will have passed in the home universe. Or, in the last chapter, as Yatima and Paolo kept going ""up"" in layers (larger and larger universes), they keep agonizing over how much ""time"" has passed since they saw the people they knew. Yet they went through something like 10\^14 different ""time"" dimensions. Why would the time elapsed that they experience imply anything about the time elapsed that their friends experienced, if we're talking about different time dimensions?

This would have made more sense if the explanation for the cosmology was that the home universe is a 3-sphere, with a macro 5-sphere, that itself has a macro 3-sphere, etc... but those spheres all have +++ and +++++ metric signatures, and they all share the same ""time"" dimension, which is just an infinite line and not part of any of the spheres, but rather, is simply in Cartesian product with all of them. (Though I don't know if that's possible, while still preserving relativistic dynamics in each universe.) But that's not how it was explained. It was explained more like my ""recap"" above, as far as I can tell. 

Secondly, what happens to the tiny universes when you just ""move"" through the space that they occupy? I assume that the ""home universe"" is in the middle of the vacuum of space in the macro 6-sphere and will never have to worry about anything in the macro-universe touching it, just by sheer probability (the ratio of ""stuff"" to empty space). And this is true of the vast majority of universes. But what happens when a Polis just flies through a point in empty space that's never been touched before, as with most points they fly through? Does it essentially crash through that universe like a wrecking ball? And all of its infinite micro-universes? And all *their* micro universes, etc? I don't remember if the book actually addresses this. But for characters that are afraid to land nano-probes on a planet because it might disrupt the life there, it seems odd that they're not worried about destroying infinite universes every time they occupy a new infinitesimal point in space.

Finally, I guess this is nitpicky, and not important to the story at all. But when writing Diaspora, was Greg Egan aware that [Lorentzian manifolds with an even number of dimensions cannot be n-spheres?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44861/for-which-b-it-is-possible-that-sn-can-have-a-lorentz-metric-why)",t2_ejrhu,False,,0,False,Greg Egan's Diaspora: Some confusions after finishing,[],r/printSF,False,6,,0,False,t3_dfj8zp,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,,1570649813.0,,[],{},,True,,1570666290.0,text,6,,,text,self.printSF,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished Diaspora.

I am not looking for purple prose here.  I'd just like to immerse myself in a story that allows me to see the setting clearly in my mind's eye.  I don't like Anne Rice's stories but her prose is a perfect example of what I'm looking for:

**1. Ryk Brown - The Frontiers Saga**

Humanity is recovering from a Bio-Digital plague that sent earth and its colonies to the stone age. Earth again starts to gain access to deep space travel and finds the colonies are also advancing with some worrying developments. This series follows the crew of the ship Aurora. There are some Halo/spartan like soldiers that come in to this later who are really cool also if anyone likes that.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Sudipto Majumdar -  Shaitan Wars**

A book of earths first contact with aliens and the battle of survival that follows. This book can be a little tech/science heavy at times but you do also get to see things from the aliens POV and they are alien in that they smell the universe as they use touch and smell to communicate. I think this should class as hard sci-fi as the travel is all sub light speed and no tech (currently 5 books in) that is beyond imagination.

**3. Star Force - Aer-ki Jyr** 

This is like a cross between mass effect, star wars and Jurassic park. If you like empire building this will be for you. There are like over a hundred books with a word count in the millions, you get to follow a group of teens and a business man as they create a galactic empire over tens of thousands of years. The main characters do not age for certain reasons so you get to follow them and more as this progresses. The cost of these books can add up so I would recommend kindle unlimited as they are all on there. I will say the books are not perfect some you could skip, mainly at the start once the author gets going this gets ironed out and the story always progresses. The author releases 1 book a month like clockwork so if you want something long term to sink your teeth into give it a try.

It's an almost pure cyberpunk novel, and through the first act I wasn't sold on it, because it does feel quite often like a straight up pastiche of early William Gibson, down to little details like a focus on naming high end fashion brands. But as it goes I feel like it finds its footing and opens out into a little more of its own conceptual space,and it ended up going some interesting places.

Bonus points: MC is not stupid. Minimal stupidity in other characters. 

The books can have action, explosions, magic, intrigue, romance, mysteries and interesting technology/societies/worldbuilding. They don't have to be ""slice of life"" but I'm not adverse.

Since ""good"" books usually aim for dramatic manipulation of the readers emotions, many books that are considered ""not well written"" could work. 
This could include books that are so bad at emotional manipulation that the attempt can be ignored by the reader - but are interesting otherwise.

Recommendations can have awkward character interactions or boring passages, I don't mind skimming (I do a lot of skimming in Weber books).

&lt;p&gt;Are there any good fictions in this genre where the protagonists are just &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;? Ir perhaps the impact of this protagonists journey just effects a very small subset of people?&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s some of the things that were hard for me:

- If the point is to demonstrate the arbitrariness and brutality of patriarchy by creating a mirror version of it where women are the perpetrators of violence and subjugation, who is the audience of this book really intended to be? I don’t really need to be shown or reminded how terrible patriarchy is because as a woman I’m in it all the time, so the scenes of mindless hordes of women raping and pillaging were hard to stomach. Or was the message just that power always corrupts? The old trope could have been portrayed in a less traumatic way.

- There appeared to be a lot of gender biological essentialism when it came to the power women got. I get that the book seemed to be trying to de-stabilize some sense of essentialism especially by the ending where notions of men’s ‘biologically superior strength’ and women’s ‘biological tendency towards nurturing’ were turned on their heads. But then why go in for the very physically originated ‘power’ of the skeins, born I’m assuming only to cis-women? Ryan, one of the few men portrayed as having a skein, was chocked up to chromosomal issues, again biology. Who’s on top of the gender power hierarchy is just who has more physical power feels pretty hollow.

- Overall, the characters and their development felt like it took a back seat to descriptions of changes to society that felt a bit like a sledgehammer with the fierce pace of changes (10 years?!).

Here's what I'm curious to fine:  Books featuring the exploits of singular or a handful of warrior-heroes who wade through hordes of enemies and/or frequently find themselves racing to their doom against insurmountable odds, set in space.     

Basically, something like the Master Chief, or Commander Shepard, from their respective videogames.   

I know there's a lot of military scifi  and some Space Opera that borders on this idea, but doesn't quite get there.   

For example,  Felix from John Steakley's **Armor** is like what I'm thinking of,  but most of the main characters from other starship-troopers-style books are not (because they're surrounded by peers basically just like themselves, they're not exceptional in their own element.

778,,printSF,"Yo PrintSF, So Honestly I have done a shit ton of research about this book but can't find it. My buddy told me about it and I figured I might as well ask here since by definition the book seems to fit the idea of SF.   


 The basic synopsis is that the whole set of stories takes the perspective of alien cultures/creatures looking at humanity, really impressing upon the strangeness of humans. In this universe, they are this weird, crazy and dangerous race to the aliens, but also a deep enigma to them. They can't seem to understand how the humans work and why they do things. It explores lots of the things that humans just naturally do, and the aliens are confused about it, like how we consume fucking poisons for fun (alcohol, nicotine, etc). In fact for that topic there's a whole story about an alien hanging out with a human and watching as they drink alcohol, he wants to try it to but is told he can't because he doesn't have a liver, and it's poison.   


There's even a war where the humans get  paid to fight another race, and they do so, the war ends in political discourse, then the humans befriend the race they were warring because they are both predators and understand each-other more and respect each-other. 

&amp;#x200B;

It even explores the aliens confusion at how we have nature preserves instead of fucking taking EVERYTHING and moving on. How we went into space cause we just wanted to rather than having drained the planet of resources.

Years ago I read a book by Scott Sigler named Earthcore.  It was absolutely fantastic.  It mixes sci-fi with intellectual genius in a realistic way.

A billion-dollar find, it waits for any company that can drill a world's record, three-mile-deep mine shaft.

Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company's driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.

785,,printSF,"Hi all,

My wife and I are going on a 3,000+ mile road trip this Fall, so we're gonna be hitting Audible something fierce! To that end, I'm looking for the right science fiction audiobook that will work for both of us. Got any good recommendations?

---

***Me***: I've been reading scifi for as long as I can remember – often toward the harder end, but I definitely love a good ole romp as well. Here's a brief smattering of some of the SF books I've recently enjoyed the most:

* **Neal Stephenson** – probably my favorite author. I loved **Seveneves**, **Cryptonomicon**, **Diamond Age**, **Anathem**, probably more
* **Three Body Problem series by Liu Cixin** – The first book was a bit of a slog in the beginning, but then it picked up *just* enough to get me to to read the sequel. LOVED the series from there!
* **Children of Time/Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky** – Suuuuper into this series right now, and I've been recommending it to everybody who'll listen! Can't wait for another sequel.
* **Red Rising series by Pierce Brown** – This lives a bit along the scifi/fantasy border, and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. 
* **The Expanse Series by James S. A. Corey** – I absolutely *devour* these novels. Certainly on the softer side, and I love the characters, love the plot.

***Wife***: Doesn't typically read SF, or any fiction for that matter. She does like to think and talk about big-picture/philosophical issues, so I've been extolling SF's unique ability to raise such issues and push the reader into new areas of thought.

789,,printSF,"I know Red Mars is considered a sci-fi classic, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy it, but I was impressed by how brilliant this book is. Its defining characteristic has to be how incredibly real everything feels. The technology, the politics, the planet itself, it's all so believable that this could be a historical account. There's plenty of social complexity in sci-fi but this book does it particularly well - the conflicts between nations and ideologies and visions served the plot fantastically. The science (which I sometimes find wanting in sci-fi) was very thorough - perhaps too much, although I did enjoy the pages-long tangents. 

The story covered a much larger timespan than I expected, but I assume he had to get to a point where the next book could take off. The journey to Mars, establishment of Underhill, expansion of the human impact on Mars, immigration, increasing political conflict, and (unsurprisingly catastrophic) revolution all flowed very smoothly and made total sense as the first 35 years on Mars. 

There were some great characters (especially Nadia, Arkady, and John) but some PoVs were less engaging than others, which is probably my biggest criticism. Ann was so miserable and Frank so bitter that it was sometimes a struggle to read their sections.

There is a narrative style that I am growing to hate and it seems to be everywhere in modern science fiction.  It is the Multi-POV 3rd person.
 
The author shows us a scene, usually a decently long one to start, then just at a climatic moment (The enemy is attacking, or the ship is about to crash, or a character reveals they have made an immense scientific breakthrough)  they shift focus to an entirely new character. They spend some time introducing that character then it is on to a third. Styles vary but you are usually following 4-5 storylines by the hundred-page mark. With space epics your author will often introduce new species, worlds, customs, and technologies along with the dozen characters. More than being confusing it is just bad storytelling. We aren’t given time to get to know characters and get invested in the narrative before jumping off to follow another.

It can be done well. Look at Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire as an example. I would use a science-fiction book if I could think of one that did this well. The series starts out with nearly all of the characters we will be following together in Winterhold. It establishes the relationships of the various characters by, go figure, having them interact with one another.  Even the only character not present, Daenerys, is supremely focused upon the Iron Throne so we never feel lost as it how the stories fit together.

That is what is missing with sci-fi epics. It seems as if every time I read one written in this style the threads of the stories take forever to weave themselves together. If it is a multi-book epic some of the storylines are still off on their own tangent when the book closes. Even when there are multiple entries in a series they should each have their own complete narrative arcs that resolve at the end of each entry. I think the Ender Series is an excellent example of this idea.

  Why is this happening? Are these authors being forced to write like this by their publishers?

818,,printSF,"As a huge fan of Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion, I found Endymion mediocre. I appreciated the worldbuilding but characters(except de Soya) were boring and it was basically a road trip story.

On the other hand, Rise of Endymion was a similar experience to Fall of Hyperion. Characters became more interesting(turns out messiah doing messiah stuff is more engaging than her travelling on a boat), most of the questions were answered and the Cantos had a satisfying conclusion.

My opinions of common criticisms:

* **Raul and Aenea romance:** I get why people consider it creepy since they meet when Aenea is 12 and Raul is 30+. I agree that there was no reason Aenea couldn't be a few years older. However their first interaction is a quick light kiss initiated by Aenea(16) and the next time they meet she is 21. So I'm not too weirded out in that regard but Raul still calling her ""kiddo"" after that was off putting. 

* **Raul is a stupid yokel:** I agree that he fits the stereotype and feels out of place in a story with AIs, androids, poets, priests, scholars, messiahs, commanders  and mutants but maybe that's the point. He is the normal non-cruciform non-ouster non-AI human to Aenea's extraordinary Void using part-human part-AI divine being. I didn't enjoy his characters until the last 300 pages but in the end it clicked. Also he can be blamed for being ignorant but whenever he asks a question Aenea just dismisses him, which was one of the most frustrating part of the series for me.

* **Too much scenery:** I too cringed when Dan Simmons described mountains for 15 pages straight or named 24 people(4 of which truly mattered) in a single paragraph. I too disliked that when reading but now that I finished the book I accept it as part of Simmons' message. *""Life should be varied, life should be everywhere and every single life matters.""* He (and Raul after accessing the Void) wouldn't sound so sincere if minor characters were dismissed as unimportant. I still think it's a legitimate criticism but it doesn't bother me.

* **Rachel/Moneta:** I heard people disliked her part of the book so I was expecting some weird twist that made her a villain or something. I don't get the criticism.

 “A post-apocalyptic tale about the power of art and the urgency of human  connection...cements Pinsker's status as a rising star in the world of  speculative fiction. A gorgeous novel that celebrates what can happen  when one person raises her voice.”**—Kirkus (starred review)** 

 “Let freedom ring in the growl of an angry guitar chord! Sarah Pinsker’s *A Song For a New Day*  is an absorbing tale of a quiet, all-too-believable American dystopia  in which a passion for music becomes the secretive, surprising seed of  rebellion.”—**Linda Nagata, Nebula Award winning author of** ***The Last Good Man*** 

 “An all-too plausible version of the apocalypse, rendered in such  compelling prose that you won’t be able to put it down...a lively and  hopeful look at how community and music and life goes on even in the  middle of dark days and malevolent corporate shenanigans.”—**Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and author of** ***Get In Trouble***   


""You'd better keep a copy of *A Song for a New Day*  with you at all times, because this book will help you survive the  future. Sarah Pinsker has written a wonderful epic about music,  community, and rediscovering the things that make us human.

Has anyone read it?  If so, what did you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A post-apocalyptic tale about the power of art and the urgency of human  connection...cements Pinsker&amp;#39;s status as a rising star in the world of  speculative fiction. A gorgeous novel that celebrates what can happen  when one person raises her voice.”&lt;strong&gt;—Kirkus (starred review)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let freedom ring in the growl of an angry guitar chord! Sarah Pinsker’s &lt;em&gt;A Song For a New Day&lt;/em&gt;  is an absorbing tale of a quiet, all-too-believable American dystopia  in which a passion for music becomes the secretive, surprising seed of  rebellion.”—&lt;strong&gt;Linda Nagata, Nebula Award winning author of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Good Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An all-too plausible version of the apocalypse, rendered in such  compelling prose that you won’t be able to put it down...a lively and  hopeful look at how community and music and life goes on even in the  middle of dark days and malevolent corporate shenanigans.”—&lt;strong&gt;Kelly Link, Pulitzer Prize finalist and author of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get In Trouble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d better keep a copy of &lt;em&gt;A Song for a New Day&lt;/em&gt;  with you at all times, because this book will help you survive the  future. Sarah Pinsker has written a wonderful epic about music,  community, and rediscovering the things that make us human.

The characters felt pretty thin and if I'm honest some of the vignettes were a bit disjointed/disconnected from the bigger picture, but each one was short enough that you never had to deal with the less interesting ones for long. I also think it's one of the few books that could have been about 100 pages longer, because honestly some of the vignettes hinted at some fascinating developments but felt very underexplained, especially towards the latter half of the story. I'd probably give it a solid 3.5 or 4/5.

Even though it's far from a perfect book, it had some wildly original ideas/memorable setpieces in it that I think could have easily been turned into novels of their own. I don't want to spoil them in the main post because it is a fairly short book and I think many people here would find it interesting, but I'm curious to hear if anyone else has ever checked this one out.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I read that Lent by Jo Walton had a time loop, but it must start well into the 2nd half of the book, but the first half is an extremely dry novel that very tangentially includes real demons, but mostly is a &amp;quot;slice of life&amp;quot; about a monk in 16th century italy. Maybe it gets good later, and maybe there&amp;#39;s a time loop in there somewhere, but I didn&amp;#39;t get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit2:  I forgot to mention it but if you also like time loops &lt;em&gt;the time traveller&amp;#39;s wife&lt;/em&gt; is one of the best. So good!&lt;/p&gt;

Part of their strategy is to provide a wider range of minors specifically catered to reading interests and genre-fiction. Upon completion of Core Classes, for example, English/Lit majors can now focus entirely on Classical Lit., Contemporary Lit., Mysteries, Romance, YA, LBGTQ+, Horror, etc. - whatever interests them.\n\nAnd I have the privilege of building the Speculative Fiction curriculum, with particular emphasis on Sci-Fi and Fantasy.\n\nI want our students to understand what distinguishes Sci-Fi/Fantasy Literature as an art form, but from the perspective of ***writers*** in these genres, not purely from the English/Lit perspective that focuses on readers analyzing, theorizing and categorizing. I want students to understand craft, how to improve their own writing and, in particular, I want students to get excited about what\'s out there. To connect with the authors and stories that will ignite their passion to read deeper, wider, and to write more. And, hopefully, to then pay that passion forward.\n\nI have 12 months to develop my curriculum. But I have several problems that might best be understood if one were to imagine this scenario: Say I have a class of 18 students and we\'re talking about tropes. 1 student is into high fantasy and has never read anything else. 3 only read hard sci-fi and think fantasy is the worst thing in existence. Another 2 are hyper-critical fans of lets say NK Jemisin and will drop the class immediately if I don\'t communicate info about tropes specifically through the lens of NK Jemisin. Another 5 are complete newbies to speculative fiction and have no idea what they like, but are open-minded and willing to read anything - they\'re just looking for a new experience. 3 are only there because they figured the sci-fi/fantasy classes would be easier to pass than those for a minor in Classical Lit. And 4 are extremely well read but aren\'t getting much of anything from the class because of the aforementioned 5 newbies having questions that could\'ve easily been answered after several minutes on a sub-Reddit like this...\n\nEssentially, I need to keep a group of people with a wide range of tastes and reading experiences engaged in a way that allows them all to participate in the dialogue while still appealing to everyone\'s specific interests. This is not an uncommon struggle among educators. So, I had the idea of gearing all reading lists and assignments (basically the entire curriculum)  ***specifically*** *to each student*. Determined by (1) the focus of the class, and (2) their individual reading experience, interests, and goals.\n\nSo, for example, say I have a class that focuses on Prose. Student #1 is not very well read but interested in the steampunk sub-genre. Student #2 is very well read and looking for some esoteric novels about Time Travel. Student #3 is well read in high-fantasy but wants to explore Dystopian Fiction. I\'d like to be able to satisfy them all with great stories that have fantastic prose in each of these genres - the kinds of stories that will get them excited to read more. But to do that I need YOU, Redditors.\n\nAnd here\'s how you can help; I need as many recommendations and suggestions as possible in order for me to create a master reading list for myself and my students. I have by no means read everything, and want to be sure that if a student comes to me asking fora soft military sci-fi, raygun-punk, or a comic-fantasy, that I have a plenty of ***quality*** material for them to enjoy. I want to be the best resource I can be.\n\nSo, below is a list of many Sci-Fi and Fantasy Sub-genres. It is by no means exhaustive, and I understand that some stories will have obvious overlaps that fall into many of these categories at once. I am hoping that, with each comment/suggestion, you may simply copy and fill out the following info:\n\n* **Title**:\n* **Author**:\n* **Sub-Genre(s)**:\n* **Form** (Novel or short story):\n* **Biggest strength(s)** (prose/style, characters, setting/world-building, plot, conflict/resolutions, themes &amp; symbolism):\n\n# Fantasy Sub-Genres:\n\nChildren\'s, Comic, Dark/Gothic, Gaslamp, Grimdark, Fairy Tale, Heroic (Sword and Sorcery), High/Epic, Low, Historical, Magical Realism, Medieval, Mythological, Noir, Paranormal, Romance, Science-Fantasy, Urban, Weird or New-Wierd, Western, YA, Xeno\n\n# Sci-Fi Sub-Genres:\n\n20 Minutes into the Future, Alien, Alternate Dimension/Universe, Speculative Biology, Documentary, Dying Earth, Hard Sci-Fi, Military, New Wave, Planetary Romance, Post-Singularity, Punk-Punk\\*\\*\\*, Soft Sci-Fi, Space Opera, Space Western, Teslatopia, Time Travel, Transhumanist, Video Game\n\n\\*\\*\\*Categories of Punk:\n\n* Atom, Bio, Cape, Clock, Cyber, Diesel, Gothic, Post-Cyber, Raygun, Ocean, Sandal, Solar, Steam, Stone\n\n# Other/Misc. Speculative Fiction Genres:\n\nApocalyptic Fiction, Dystopia, Horror, Post-Apocalypse, Supernatural, Utopia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeally, my goal is to have 10-15 solid novels and 5-10 short stories for EACH of these sub-genres.

Part of their strategy is to provide a wider range of minors specifically catered to reading interests and genre-fiction. Upon completion of Core Classes, for example, English/Lit majors can now focus entirely on Classical Lit., Contemporary Lit., Mysteries, Romance, YA, LBGTQ+, Horror, etc. - whatever interests them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I have the privilege of building the Speculative Fiction curriculum, with particular emphasis on Sci-Fi and Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want our students to understand what distinguishes Sci-Fi/Fantasy Literature as an art form, but from the perspective of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;writers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in these genres, not purely from the English/Lit perspective that focuses on readers analyzing, theorizing and categorizing. I want students to understand craft, how to improve their own writing and, in particular, I want students to get excited about what&amp;#39;s out there. To connect with the authors and stories that will ignite their passion to read deeper, wider, and to write more. And, hopefully, to then pay that passion forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 12 months to develop my curriculum. But I have several problems that might best be understood if one were to imagine this scenario: Say I have a class of 18 students and we&amp;#39;re talking about tropes. 1 student is into high fantasy and has never read anything else. 3 only read hard sci-fi and think fantasy is the worst thing in existence. Another 2 are hyper-critical fans of lets say NK Jemisin and will drop the class immediately if I don&amp;#39;t communicate info about tropes specifically through the lens of NK Jemisin. Another 5 are complete newbies to speculative fiction and have no idea what they like, but are open-minded and willing to read anything - they&amp;#39;re just looking for a new experience. 3 are only there because they figured the sci-fi/fantasy classes would be easier to pass than those for a minor in Classical Lit. And 4 are extremely well read but aren&amp;#39;t getting much of anything from the class because of the aforementioned 5 newbies having questions that could&amp;#39;ve easily been answered after several minutes on a sub-Reddit like this...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I need to keep a group of people with a wide range of tastes and reading experiences engaged in a way that allows them all to participate in the dialogue while still appealing to everyone&amp;#39;s specific interests. This is not an uncommon struggle among educators. So, I had the idea of gearing all reading lists and assignments (basically the entire curriculum)  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to each student&lt;/em&gt;. Determined by (1) the focus of the class, and (2) their individual reading experience, interests, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, for example, say I have a class that focuses on Prose. Student #1 is not very well read but interested in the steampunk sub-genre. Student #2 is very well read and looking for some esoteric novels about Time Travel. Student #3 is well read in high-fantasy but wants to explore Dystopian Fiction. I&amp;#39;d like to be able to satisfy them all with great stories that have fantastic prose in each of these genres - the kinds of stories that will get them excited to read more. But to do that I need YOU, Redditors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s how you can help; I need as many recommendations and suggestions as possible in order for me to create a master reading list for myself and my students. I have by no means read everything, and want to be sure that if a student comes to me asking fora soft military sci-fi, raygun-punk, or a comic-fantasy, that I have a plenty of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; material for them to enjoy. I want to be the best resource I can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, below is a list of many Sci-Fi and Fantasy Sub-genres. It is by no means exhaustive, and I understand that some stories will have obvious overlaps that fall into many of these categories at once. I am hoping that, with each comment/suggestion, you may simply copy and fill out the following info:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Genre(s)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt; (Novel or short story):&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggest strength(s)&lt;/strong&gt; (prose/style, characters, setting/world-building, plot, conflict/resolutions, themes &amp;amp; symbolism):&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Fantasy Sub-Genres:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children&amp;#39;s, Comic, Dark/Gothic, Gaslamp, Grimdark, Fairy Tale, Heroic (Sword and Sorcery), High/Epic, Low, Historical, Magical Realism, Medieval, Mythological, Noir, Paranormal, Romance, Science-Fantasy, Urban, Weird or New-Wierd, Western, YA, Xeno&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sci-Fi Sub-Genres:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20 Minutes into the Future, Alien, Alternate Dimension/Universe, Speculative Biology, Documentary, Dying Earth, Hard Sci-Fi, Military, New Wave, Planetary Romance, Post-Singularity, Punk-Punk***, Soft Sci-Fi, Space Opera, Space Western, Teslatopia, Time Travel, Transhumanist, Video Game&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***Categories of Punk:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Atom, Bio, Cape, Clock, Cyber, Diesel, Gothic, Post-Cyber, Raygun, Ocean, Sandal, Solar, Steam, Stone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Other/Misc.

This year was the first year I have really gotten into hard sci-fi and I have gone through several books that have just blown away my expectations. A few years ago I read The Martian and it was the first book I really couldnt stop reading, and ended up listening to it on audiobook as well. Since then I have gotten more interested in space technology. Early this year I was watching a youtube video (smartereveryday) and he reccomended seveneves in the audible plug. He read the first line and I was hooked. 

Seveneves in my opinion was just mind blowing, only slightly held back by its built in sequel (its third part). After finishing this book I was desperate to find another amazing book (still my favorite).

Aurora filled a hole that seveneves left, it was a slow starter but I thouroughly enjoyed the entire book, the idea of a living ship was beautiful.

Saturn Run was also really good hardSF. The research was incredible and had really interesting characters

Delta-V came out of nowhere and was another book I just couldn't put down. I am desperately awaiting a sequel.

904,,printSF,"My budget is tight, but I do have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. I can read any book in the program for free. A lot of indie SF authors publish there, but many of them are crappy. Looking for the good stuff: original, not formulaic, fun. I love space operas, but not dystopias.

This is the first book in an epic Chinese classic kung fu fantasy that's been compared to George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling, translated into English by Anna Holmwood and available in the US for the first time. It starts with Guo Jing, who grew up in Genghis Khan’s army after his father was murdered. As he grows into adolescence in Mongolia, a group called the Seven Heroes of the South searches for the boy, intent on bringing him back to China and to train him in martial arts. *Everything I’ve seen says that plot descriptions simply don’t do this book justice*, so pick it up as soon as you can and check out its majesty for yourself.

*Pssst...Netflix...shhh...Yepp, you, the streaming mogul...are you listening? Look no further, here is your next big thing!*

First, lemme tell you how PFH influences my life...

**It hurts my family life...** because, when I read his books, I stop properly looking after my family: I get home after work, sit down, tell everyone to leave me alone and go on reading. My wife sometime talks to me, but I perceive only distant noises, something that must not be too important.

**It hurts my professional life...** because I stay up in the night until 3am, and next day I obviously call in to my boss, that I take a day off.

**It hurts my social life..**.because when I go out with my friends to play a boardgame, I just grab my kindle unobtrusively, when it is not my turn, and read few pages....much to the dismay of my buddies. Quite frankly, getting the next PFH book is like getting prison time: I am not *allowed* to do anything else. And when I finish the book, then - and only then - I can go on probation and resume my regularly scheduled programme. It is that addictive.

Worst of all, **it hurts my reading hobby...** because I care a lot less about other books. Sure, I read an Alaistar Reynolds here or a Neil Asher book there, but I am just treading water until waiting for the good stuff. Don't come to me with the Three-Body Problem fellas, that is a massive disappointment and can't comprehend how that actually got that Hugo (prolly geopolitics), while PFH does not even get a nod. Bleh, wandered off a bit...

So, all the above feelings skyrocketed to a whole new level this spring, when I finished Salvation. Man, I just can't tell you how painful not to be able continue reading right away. Luckily, I just hit a stroke of good fortune, and received an advance copy of Salvation Lost (thanks!) in exchange for generating some noise about it. Now, if you haven't read the first book of the trilogy, you must know that you really should not read further. I will be spoiler-free of the 2nd book, but can't review this without spoiling the 1st one. Also, this being a detailed review, if you are clever, you may be able to work some details out. You have been warned.

Dude...I told you not to continue. Just get the first book, read through, get shocked and come back.

Still here? Cool.

Salvation Lost is very different from the first book. Salvation was a ""whodunit"" story, with elaborate world building and a slowly unraveling mystery, sprinkled with a tiny bit of paranoia. That book ends on a cliffhanger that explains the events before and at the same time outlines a very grim future, a future - as we already know - that changes humanity forever. On the other hand, this book is about escalation of the conflict, desperate actions (and counteractions) to achieve survival, and witnessing the disaster that is unfolding, all these unfolding at a breakneck speed. It is also a middle book of a trilogy, with all the baggage that means: it continues the story from the first book, but does not really conclude. Really, this is one big story split into three volumes.

Gone are the flashbacks of the first book, the time of worldbuilding is over, but we still have *present* and the *far-future* storylines. In the *present* we get to see the overwhelming catastrophe that humanity facing through the eyes of multiple characters. Very cleverly, these people are from different classes, so rotating between them gives us a glimpse of personal sacrifices they are going through - and, in general, the disaster that falls on humanity. The present-time pacing is very tight, and so is the timetable: the unfolding events are covering only few days, where high-risk-high-reward missions are only about to get us a few more. And when the Olyix start to utilize there KCells to aid them in their invasion, certain chapters gets a real horror vibe to them.

My favourite character this time is Ollie, a lowlife criminal unwittingly entangled into affairs no humans ever wants to be involved with. Ollie's motivation is very relatable, despite all his misgivings you will come to like him. He is a byproduct of the society he grew up in, he ended up with wrong people, but he is not an evil person. He gives us the viewpoint of lower classes, how everything about the invasion is just a rumor on the internet and how they are the first ones to be abandoned by the higher-ups. Their drug-induced conversation with his friend, while watching television broadcast of the invasion, is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read.

Next up is Gwendoline, who appeared in Salvation as a frightened little girl. This time she is an upper echelon middle-aged woman, doing important work in Connexion. Despite being family of Zangaris, she represents the hard-working executive who is just outside of the inner circle: Her eyes are the window we can use to peek into the life of rich, whose fortune will mean nothing in few weeks.

We get back Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik and - of course - Jessika, our friendly neigbourhood alien spy/diplomat. Out of all of them Alik gets the least spotlight, she is mostly off-screen to manhandle some Washington DC politicians. Yuri is still the no-nonsense security man, he is calling the shots and is making all the right (and hard) decisions, while Callum is still the resourceful creative troubleshooter he always was...both of them is having a considerable role in formulating a response during the invasion, and it is a joy to read their - usually action packed - chapters. Kandara is also getting a decent role, we get a better glimpse into her personality, because well...she understandably has trust issues.

Jessika becomes a major character who has to overcome human mistrust to get humanity very quickly where we need to be in order to ensure survival. It is a main theme, that we may not want to hear and accept what she tells us. She and her colleagues also has some neat technology brought with them, that will help us to survive, but let's stay spoiler free here. I was very impressed with how the different timelines are subtly connected: in one of the *present* chapter a certain virus is mentioned, that is coming back almost immediately in the *far-future* chapter, but not before. I found these small and subtle pieces fascinating, how they are connecting the different storylines, yet none spoils the another.

Speaking of *far-future*, if you read the publicly available [prologue](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/550926/salvation-lost-by-peter-f-hamilton/9780399178856), you will have a very good idea where those chapters take us. I have a bit less to say about these, they are very spoiler-prone, but we still have the same core characters, Dellian and Yirella. We get to experience how the ""Lure"" - that was hinted at in the first book - pans out. Now I'll be very careful here, but still, here's some teasing: in Salvation it was emphasized that in order to be safe, humans must be silent. Thus, we do not know anything which is beyond the knowledge of our characters. But rest assured, stuff happened in the galaxy in that 10.000 years, even if we do not know about them yet. We also get a very little teasing about some previously unseen aliens, who I expect to have a greater role in the final book.

We also have a new character in this timeline, almost from the start, though neither its allegiance, nor its origin will be apparent at first. It has a major - even ""deus exish"" - role in the final part of the book, which is a little bit unexpected, but I am 100% certain his presence and origin will be explained in the final installment. The way it was written also reminded me very much of Gore Burnelli from the Void trilogy.

One aspect I extremely like about this trilogy is the ""hard scifiness"" of it. In the Commonwealth series, especially from the Void trilogy onwards, humans travelled between stars - and later, between galaxies - with a relative ease. That part did not feel very ""hard"" to me. Here, however, distances are vast, and there is no way to cheat around them. There is an explanation how travel between galaxies (nearest is 2.5 million light years) is totally out of reach, and I actually &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; there is no escape from the Olyix. Our galaxy is a prison, where they are the top dogs, and there's no such thing as leaving for greener pastures. We either fight, hide...or die. No other options.

I also was amazed by the depiction of Olyix. It becomes very clear real quick, that Olyix are not stupid, and they are not stagnant, either. Yepp, they are in charge in the galaxy, but they are not sitting back and becoming complacent. Both in the *present* and in the *future* we witness that they are advancing. Mostly technological changes, yes, they may not evolve as a species, but some stuff the Neana know and tell us about them is out-of-date. We may outmaneuver them once, but the same trick will not work again. They are not waiting patiently for us to grow and defeat them. Humans must be really on top of their game. These touches make them even more menacing, more real: It is not coincidence they have been able to persecute their campaign for eons.

I am happy to inform everyone that the ending is great, it is intriguing and sets up questions that will leave you thinking until the final one arrives. I am double happy to tell you it will not consume you like the ending of the first book did: if you have heard, that ending of Salvation will render you an incoherent mess mumbling about ""how can I survive a whole year until next book""...you heard that right:) But the 1st and 2nd book together will leave you in a more relaxed state: you will still want more, but you will be able to go ahead with your life until 2020 October.

Back to the first line of my review: I never could imagine how a Commonwealth or Night's Dawn TV series would be doable (scope, characeters, locations, budgets). This however...this screams for television. Smaller cast of characters, basically everything happens at Earth, action, twists and dread. It has it all. Can't even comprehend how Amazon scooped up Three-Body Problem and not this one....er....sorry again.

Long story short: Salvation Lost is absolutely mind-blowing. Goodreads should introduce the 6th - and maybe 7th - stars and reserve it for PFH.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pssst...Netflix...shhh...Yepp, you, the streaming mogul...are you listening? Look no further, here is your next big thing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lemme tell you how PFH influences my life...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It hurts my family life...&lt;/strong&gt; because, when I read his books, I stop properly looking after my family: I get home after work, sit down, tell everyone to leave me alone and go on reading. My wife sometime talks to me, but I perceive only distant noises, something that must not be too important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It hurts my professional life...&lt;/strong&gt; because I stay up in the night until 3am, and next day I obviously call in to my boss, that I take a day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It hurts my social life..&lt;/strong&gt;.because when I go out with my friends to play a boardgame, I just grab my kindle unobtrusively, when it is not my turn, and read few pages....much to the dismay of my buddies. Quite frankly, getting the next PFH book is like getting prison time: I am not &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to do anything else. And when I finish the book, then - and only then - I can go on probation and resume my regularly scheduled programme. It is that addictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, &lt;strong&gt;it hurts my reading hobby...&lt;/strong&gt; because I care a lot less about other books. Sure, I read an Alaistar Reynolds here or a Neil Asher book there, but I am just treading water until waiting for the good stuff. Don&amp;#39;t come to me with the Three-Body Problem fellas, that is a massive disappointment and can&amp;#39;t comprehend how that actually got that Hugo (prolly geopolitics), while PFH does not even get a nod. Bleh, wandered off a bit...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all the above feelings skyrocketed to a whole new level this spring, when I finished Salvation. Man, I just can&amp;#39;t tell you how painful not to be able continue reading right away. Luckily, I just hit a stroke of good fortune, and received an advance copy of Salvation Lost (thanks!) in exchange for generating some noise about it. Now, if you haven&amp;#39;t read the first book of the trilogy, you must know that you really should not read further. I will be spoiler-free of the 2nd book, but can&amp;#39;t review this without spoiling the 1st one. Also, this being a detailed review, if you are clever, you may be able to work some details out. You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude...I told you not to continue. Just get the first book, read through, get shocked and come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still here? Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salvation Lost is very different from the first book. Salvation was a &amp;quot;whodunit&amp;quot; story, with elaborate world building and a slowly unraveling mystery, sprinkled with a tiny bit of paranoia. That book ends on a cliffhanger that explains the events before and at the same time outlines a very grim future, a future - as we already know - that changes humanity forever. On the other hand, this book is about escalation of the conflict, desperate actions (and counteractions) to achieve survival, and witnessing the disaster that is unfolding, all these unfolding at a breakneck speed. It is also a middle book of a trilogy, with all the baggage that means: it continues the story from the first book, but does not really conclude. Really, this is one big story split into three volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the flashbacks of the first book, the time of worldbuilding is over, but we still have &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;far-future&lt;/em&gt; storylines. In the &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; we get to see the overwhelming catastrophe that humanity facing through the eyes of multiple characters. Very cleverly, these people are from different classes, so rotating between them gives us a glimpse of personal sacrifices they are going through - and, in general, the disaster that falls on humanity. The present-time pacing is very tight, and so is the timetable: the unfolding events are covering only few days, where high-risk-high-reward missions are only about to get us a few more. And when the Olyix start to utilize there KCells to aid them in their invasion, certain chapters gets a real horror vibe to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite character this time is Ollie, a lowlife criminal unwittingly entangled into affairs no humans ever wants to be involved with. Ollie&amp;#39;s motivation is very relatable, despite all his misgivings you will come to like him. He is a byproduct of the society he grew up in, he ended up with wrong people, but he is not an evil person. He gives us the viewpoint of lower classes, how everything about the invasion is just a rumor on the internet and how they are the first ones to be abandoned by the higher-ups. Their drug-induced conversation with his friend, while watching television broadcast of the invasion, is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is Gwendoline, who appeared in Salvation as a frightened little girl. This time she is an upper echelon middle-aged woman, doing important work in Connexion. Despite being family of Zangaris, she represents the hard-working executive who is just outside of the inner circle: Her eyes are the window we can use to peek into the life of rich, whose fortune will mean nothing in few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get back Yuri, Callum, Kandara, Alik and - of course - Jessika, our friendly neigbourhood alien spy/diplomat. Out of all of them Alik gets the least spotlight, she is mostly off-screen to manhandle some Washington DC politicians. Yuri is still the no-nonsense security man, he is calling the shots and is making all the right (and hard) decisions, while Callum is still the resourceful creative troubleshooter he always was...both of them is having a considerable role in formulating a response during the invasion, and it is a joy to read their - usually action packed - chapters. Kandara is also getting a decent role, we get a better glimpse into her personality, because well...she understandably has trust issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessika becomes a major character who has to overcome human mistrust to get humanity very quickly where we need to be in order to ensure survival. It is a main theme, that we may not want to hear and accept what she tells us. She and her colleagues also has some neat technology brought with them, that will help us to survive, but let&amp;#39;s stay spoiler free here. I was very impressed with how the different timelines are subtly connected: in one of the &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; chapter a certain virus is mentioned, that is coming back almost immediately in the &lt;em&gt;far-future&lt;/em&gt; chapter, but not before. I found these small and subtle pieces fascinating, how they are connecting the different storylines, yet none spoils the another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;far-future&lt;/em&gt;, if you read the publicly available &lt;a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/550926/salvation-lost-by-peter-f-hamilton/9780399178856""&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt;, you will have a very good idea where those chapters take us. I have a bit less to say about these, they are very spoiler-prone, but we still have the same core characters, Dellian and Yirella. We get to experience how the &amp;quot;Lure&amp;quot; - that was hinted at in the first book - pans out. Now I&amp;#39;ll be very careful here, but still, here&amp;#39;s some teasing: in Salvation it was emphasized that in order to be safe, humans must be silent. Thus, we do not know anything which is beyond the knowledge of our characters. But rest assured, stuff happened in the galaxy in that 10.000 years, even if we do not know about them yet. We also get a very little teasing about some previously unseen aliens, who I expect to have a greater role in the final book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a new character in this timeline, almost from the start, though neither its allegiance, nor its origin will be apparent at first. It has a major - even &amp;quot;deus exish&amp;quot; - role in the final part of the book, which is a little bit unexpected, but I am 100% certain his presence and origin will be explained in the final installment. The way it was written also reminded me very much of Gore Burnelli from the Void trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect I extremely like about this trilogy is the &amp;quot;hard scifiness&amp;quot; of it. In the Commonwealth series, especially from the Void trilogy onwards, humans travelled between stars - and later, between galaxies - with a relative ease. That part did not feel very &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; to me. Here, however, distances are vast, and there is no way to cheat around them. There is an explanation how travel between galaxies (nearest is 2.5 million light years) is totally out of reach, and I actually &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;felt&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; there is no escape from the Olyix. Our galaxy is a prison, where they are the top dogs, and there&amp;#39;s no such thing as leaving for greener pastures. We either fight, hide...or die. No other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also was amazed by the depiction of Olyix. It becomes very clear real quick, that Olyix are not stupid, and they are not stagnant, either. Yepp, they are in charge in the galaxy, but they are not sitting back and becoming complacent. Both in the &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; and in the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; we witness that they are advancing. Mostly technological changes, yes, they may not evolve as a species, but some stuff the Neana know and tell us about them is out-of-date. We may outmaneuver them once, but the same trick will not work again. They are not waiting patiently for us to grow and defeat them. Humans must be really on top of their game. These touches make them even more menacing, more real: It is not coincidence they have been able to persecute their campaign for eons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to inform everyone that the ending is great, it is intriguing and sets up questions that will leave you thinking until the final one arrives. I am double happy to tell you it will not consume you like the ending of the first book did: if you have heard, that ending of Salvation will render you an incoherent mess mumbling about &amp;quot;how can I survive a whole year until next book&amp;quot;...you heard that right:) But the 1st and 2nd book together will leave you in a more relaxed state: you will still want more, but you will be able to go ahead with your life until 2020 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the first line of my review: I never could imagine how a Commonwealth or Night&amp;#39;s Dawn TV series would be doable (scope, characeters, locations, budgets). This however...this screams for television. Smaller cast of characters, basically everything happens at Earth, action, twists and dread. It has it all. Can&amp;#39;t even comprehend how Amazon scooped up Three-Body Problem and not this one....er....sorry again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Salvation Lost is absolutely mind-blowing. Goodreads should introduce the 6th - and maybe 7th - stars and reserve it for PFH. This trilogy sticks with you: you will go out, watch the stars, and say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METI_(Messaging_Extraterrestrial_Intelligence""&gt;METI Thingy&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;may not be such a good idea after all...perhaps we should just listen quitely for a good while and compare notes before shouting out loud into the unknown that we do not understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

943,,printSF,"I saw this book recommended in this subreddit some time back on books about first contact but from a religious perspective. I found the premise quite interesting and started reading it as it was highly recommended and I saw that it won multiple awards for Sci Fi. Now having finished the book, my feelings about it are mixed. From a SciFi and a SETI first contact type story I thought it wasn't upto the mark. 

While the premise about a Jesuit mission is super interesting, I wasn't fully convinced on a few things like how quickly and accidentally they come across the first signal, the justification for the people chosen for the mission (seemed poor/not logical), and I felt the story went downhill once the aliens were introduced and we started reading from their POV as well. In this regard I found Rendezvous with Rama as the best first contact book iv read and it scored in all the above areas: the detection of the vessel and the response to it and it's timeline was very believable, as were the crew chosen for the mission and the entire sense of intrigue and mystery unfolded superbly layer by layer and held very well till the end. There was an interesting premise in The Sparrow about how first settlers can unintentionally alter the existing balance of power amongst natives but this was barely explored and was explained away in just a few paras. I felt there was a lot to build upon here.

However, if I leave aside the SciFi aspect and look at it more as a book about philosophy, theology, faith in God and his place in the universe, I think this book scores much better. Ofcourse there were major issues in this perspective as well, specifically with regards to the ending, which seemed to me that it went to a really dark place really fast just to prove a point but didn't seem logical.

Here are my thoughts on the ones I've read:

* The Sparrow - 4/5 - Ending was obvious, the cast were really dumb and perfectly whimsical but I liked the story overall.
* The Gap Series - Book 1 3/5, Book 2 4.5/5, Book 3 4/5 - Going pretty good but the 3rd book had a lot of unnecessary perspectives.
* Kaleidoscope Century - 3/5 - I can see where the depressing part may be but I didn't really enjoy it that much.
* The Library at Mount Char - 4/5 - Funny and sad and enjoyable.
* The Road - 3/5 - I didn't enjoy the writing style. I found it distracting.
* I have no mouth etcetc - 4/5
* Planetfall - 5/5 - It was incredible reading from the perspective of someone with a mental illness. I loved this one.
* The Three Body Problem - Book 1 3.5/5, Book 2 4/5, Book 3 4.5/5 - The first one was quite boring compared to the other 2.
* Flowers for Algernon - 4/5 - Read it in a day.
* Parable of the Sower - 5/5 - couldn't sit around not reading it when I had time.

Here are the ones I own but haven't read yet:

* Book 4 and 5 of the Gap Series.
* Blindsight and Starfish by Peter Watts.
* Xenogenesis Series by Octavia Butler.
* Seveneves by Neal Stephenson.
* Consider Phelbas by Ian Banks.
* The Water Knife by Paolo Bacigalupi.
* The Gone World by Tim Sweterlisch.
* Altered Carbon by Richard K Morgan.
* Revealation Space
* Titan by Steven Baxter

957,,printSF,"Title about says it all. I often see pulpy and/or golden age books described as ""fun"", but it's less fun and more slog to read a book that is covertly or overtly disdainful of your entire gender (or race, etc). Most days, I just want to read some shallow, fast-paced, escapist FUN, but usually when I check out recommendations for same, they make me feel worse rather than better. I can hold my nose and get something out of it, but that kinda defeats the whole purpose. I'm interested both in dark, hardboiled pulpy books and optimistic golden agey books here; whether it's grim or not, the important thing is that it's fun.

Here are a few things that fit what I'm looking for to some extent:

-Vorkosigan saga. Plenty feminist, but not quite shallow enough. It's a fantastic, fun series but it's very thoughtful, real, and constantly transcends the space opera box one expects it to stay in. This gets some points in the golden age category for being optimistic and Trekky.

-Takeshi Kovacs and other books by Richard K. Morgan. This might be the closest example I've found of what I'm after. It's fast-paced, violent, borderline pornographic, but mostly doesn't shit on women. Lefty pulp, almost. But women still get relegated to the sidelines, get bizarrely hot for protag's dick at weird moments, are sexually tortured, etc.

-Star Trek: TNG. Okay, so, Troi makes me scream internally, but I was raised on this show so it's easy to look past. TNG evokes the optimistic golden age feels for me and usually leaves me feeling better than I did. But sweet christ does it have its problems. Also it's a TV show.

-Comics: Transmetropolitan, Saga, Bitch Planet.

-Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. I'm in the middle of this and it's... okay. He doesn't hate women, and it's very golden agey and violent, but it is still about manly men with women as satellite characters.

-First 3 Praxis books by Walter Jon Williams. Literally has a borderline-psychopath female viewpoint character who gets back at men who wronged her. Awww yeah. The Accidental War lost me however with a pretty damn offensive portrayal of a trans woman.

-MURDERBOT. MURDERBOT MURDERBOT MURDERBOT.

What I'm NOT looking for:

-Becky Chambers's Wayfarers. Okay, it's optimistic and has simple plotlines, but it's more cozy than fun. Also, I really only thought A Closed and Common Orbit was worth my time of the three.

Can anyone out there relate? Any recommendations? Where are all the books by women with ultraviolence and sex and tidy endings?

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven)

&gt; Set in the days of civilization's collapse, Station Eleven tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.

&gt; One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of King Lear. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.

971,,printSF,"(There are some spoilers about Star Maker in this text, but I'm unsure whether you can even call them spoilers since the book is about an idea about consciousness rather than a traditional conflict driven novel, and as such is more a philosophy told through a story. If you plan to read it and prefer not to know, I recommend you stop reading here.) 

Someone recommended ""Star Maker"" by Olaf Stapledon to me a few years back. I'm an avid consumer of sci-fi, although the past ten years I've consumed it more in movie/series formats than books. Since Arthur C Clarke, who was one of my favorite authors as a kid who escaped a lot into books, called it ""probably the most powerful work of imagination ever written"" and several other authors considered it to be very influential in their work (and CS Lewis called the end ""devil worship""), I decided to give it a go. 

I have to admit that it wasn't an easy read if you're used to the traditional western way of storytelling with conflict as a major driver of the plot. It really was quite imaginative, so much so that when I reached about 70% where he wrote about stars communicating with each other, I put it down. I had reached the limits of my suspension of disbelief for that time. Still, I couldn't get it out of my head, and I eventually returned to it and finished it. 

It took a couple years for me to digest it, but in hindsight I can see that It changed my mindset in a very profound way. It paved the way for an existential crisis that was turbulent, sometimes very unpleasant, but in the end very constructive.

980,,printSF,"I'm not seeing a dedicated review thread for this book. Apologies if I missed it. Don't read this post if you don't want spoilers.

I always think of the release of a new Gibson book as a big deal.

I re-read The Peripheral in anticipation / preparation for this one -- Agency is definitely its sequel (perhaps that's not 100% the semantically-correct term, given that the near-present half of the story takes place earlier than the near-present portion of The Peripheral -- but the far-future portion is sequential to the previous book's, and both segments feature characters introduced there). It's also (it seems to me) very clearly the second book in one of his trilogies. (Hopefully not his last, but SF writers tend not to have that long a shelf life).

The Peripheral has a lot of tics and flavors I've come to savor from Billy G: low-rent characters facing hi-tech challenges, a certain amount of fascination with the machinery of fame, substance abuse problems, and sweet, fragmented prose.

Agency doesn't really have those things, unless you want to count gig-economy knowledge workers as ""low-rent"", and the entirety of Silicon Valley society as caught up in a culture of fame implementation. What I miss though is the tightness of prose in this one -- I am thinking that the last-minute rewrite due to a Hillary-less White House, and the unfortunate death of his long-time editor, have resulted in a book that doesn't really feel finished. (And I kind of miss Wilf Netherton's drinking problem -- I'm glad he's happier, but he's a bit less interesting as a dad).

I'm going to skip over Eunice, who's very much the most interesting character in the book, and a spiritual grand-daughter to Mike in Heinlein's Moon Is A Harsh Mistress. Her antics are pretty cool and amount to a kind of sufficiently-advanced-technology-indistinguishable...

Kirkus Reviews rags on the book pretty badly, calling it ""possibly tired"" and I have to agree that the middle half of the story is basically a chase that doesn't expose us to very much that's cutting-edge interesting. It mostly seemed like stalling, while certain other threads in the book could catch up.

I thought of it as a kind of shell game, or a juggling act. After Eunice disappears in Chapter 35 -- Gibson employing his trademark one scene per chapter, a tic I've always enjoyed -- (and  I couldn't ever see her as permanently deleted, so the stakes never felt high to me -- similarly for the impending nuclear war), Verity Jones is chased by bad guys, switches vehicles, hides somewhere, gets found out. Wash-rinse-repeat until we're about 90% through the book.  Upstream, in 2136 London, Lowbeer dispatches threats to her person that were never too credible.

Unlike Flynn, Peripheral's protagonist, Jones never really \*does\* anything. She follows instructions from people who, like her, also have no real idea why they are doing the things they are doing. Who lack agency. Which I assume is no accident, and maybe after I've digested it further I'll get the joke.

I don't mean to be unremittingly negative. William Gibson always gives me something to think about. In this case, I think it's obvious that the third book of the trilogy will address the fact that no one in the Lowbeer / Netherton future knows how the connections to the ""stubs"" are made, and that they themselves are probably a ""big stub"" (as Connor jokes). So that should be fun. And so should the existence of a self-aware AI who will no doubt be multi-homed in different continua.

982,,printSF,"About 3 years ago I got introduced to science fiction when a friend handed me Dark Matter (Crouch) and told me in no uncertain terms that I must read it. In the decade prior to this I had read exactly 1 book, the DaVinci Code, and never even knew I had friends that *could* read, let alone were getting excited enough about it to aggressively share book recommendations.


I was in my early 30s at the time, still holding onto my 20s by spending my free time and money between bars and video games, and had absolutely zero interest in sitting down to read books. Which is to say that when this friend thrust a book into my hands and told me to read it, my decision to read it had nothing to do with the book itself. I thought he must need to tell me something, or maybe there's something bigger at play here. Or he's on drugs and hopefully he's left me some between the pages. The notion that he recommended a book to me because he had read it, enjoyed it, and thought that I too would enjoy it never crossed my mind.


So I started reading it right away and finished it that same day. This was quite the impressive feat at the time for me. Not so much that I read an entire book in one day, but rather the fact that a book was able to keep my attention for longer than 20 minutes. I called my friend and interrogated him as to why he wanted me to read it, and it turns out he just really liked the book and knew me well enough to know I'd like it too. Mother. Fucker.


And I did enjoy it. So much that I googled ""books to read if you like Dark Matter"" and immediately ordered the Red Rising trilogy the search results pointed me towards. 2 days later they arrive and I blow through the trilogy in a week. Learning that science fiction was more than my parent's Stargate SG-1 was a major discovery. Being able and eager to prioritize reading over television and video games was a revelation.


Looking back I'm a bit embarrassed at how amazed I was at Dark Matter and Red Rising. They're both good enough books, for sure, but they're also very simple and barely scratch the surface of what science fiction is able to accomplish. Dark Matter in particular left me feeling quite silly after I re-read it a few months ago. It's a fun book, no doubt, but it is the quintessential ""basic bitch"" of big idea scifi. It is also, as it turns out, the perfect amount of basic bitch fun to grab a disaffected non-reader by the balls and have them thank you for it.


After Red Rising I found r/printSF, sorted by all-time best, and quickly had a list of books that kept popping up in the recommendations threads. Hyperion, Blindsight, Neuromancer, Children of Time, the Culture, the Quantum Thief, Revelation Space, and so on. Real, hardcore science fiction. Not Dark Matter. 


I launched straight into Hyperion and was mesmerized throughout all 4 books. You've all read it, you all know what I'm talking about, and those of you that say the two Endymion books are garbage: no, you're garbage!


Then came news that Obama was reading a science fiction book called The Three-Body Problem, apparently the greatest work of Chinese science fiction and newly translated into English. Immediately following Hyperion I dove into TBP and the series ended up defining what it is I love about science fiction in the same way that the Expanse series defines what it is I hate. 


Big ideas, drawn out to interesting places and exploring the philosophical and societal ramifications. I don't care if the prose isn't perfect or if the characters weren't expertly crafted. Bring me real science mixed with the purely theoretical, the more fringe the better, and shatter my mind with the philosophy that emerges if things end up being this particular flavor of *just right*. Save your hero journeys, spare me your space operas. I once was blind but now I see; Red Rising is pulp fiction and Blood Music is a masterpiece. Fight me.


Over the next 2 ½ years I read a few hundred books. I consider myself quite well read in the hard science fiction space, although I admit I've restricted myself primarily to science fiction's brand name authors and their most popular works (I'll read you soon, Ophiuchi Hotline, I promise).


I say all of this because context is important, and I want you to know exactly what kind of reader I am so that when I tell you that Anathem is the greatest book of all time you'll know that it comes from someone that knows what they're talking about. Or doesn't. Maybe you think the Expanse is top shelf scifi and that Robert Wilson's 'Spin' is highfalutin crap. Maybe you read Roadside Picnic and thought it wasn't that big of a deal, and maybe you think A Fire Upon the Deep could have spent more time with the dogs.


What I'm trying to say is that every once in a while you come across a book that alters the way you view everything that came before and all that will come after. Hyperion and TBP are two such examples for me. Anathem is the latest, the first in a year or two, and has rocked my foundation as a reader more so than maybe even Dark Matter did when I was a novice. I foresee this being the stick with which all else is measured for a very, very long time.


To sum it all up, I feel both privileged to have had the opportunity to experience Anathem and also deeply saddened by the fact I am now likely cursed never to witness another reach such heights.  If you've read Stephenson then you know what it is to be hurt by Stephenson. Anathem makes up for all his prior sins, not wasting a single one of its 932 pages and sticks the landing to perfection.
